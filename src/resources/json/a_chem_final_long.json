would be differ if at all if the atmospher pressur increas all other condit stay the same iv on fig draw a second curv to the graph produc if the same volum of moldm chnclaq decompos at a constant temperatur of c all other condit stay the same c anoth student investig the effect of chang the concentr of cghnclaq at c he measur the time taken to collect dm of ng and s the rate of n product by divid dm by the time taken the result are n in tabl tabl concentr of time taken to rate of n chnclaq collect dm product moldm of ns dm s i complet the tabl to the valu for the rate of n product your answer to three signific figur ii the reaction is first order and obey the follow rate equat rate k cghnc how the data in tabl support thi ment iii the depend variabl in thi investig iv the student want to perform a similar experi use moldm cghnclaq how the student should make a standard solut of cm of moldm chnclaq start from a solut of mol dm cghnclaq the name and size of ani key apparatu which should be d and how the student should ensur the volum is exactli cm write your answer use a seri of number step v whi iv must be carri out at a temperatur below c"
