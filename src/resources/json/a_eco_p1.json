Private goods are defined by two key characteristics: they are both **excludable** and **rival** in consumption.\n\n*   **Excludability** means that a seller can prevent people who do not pay for the good from consuming it. This is essential for a market to function, as it allows firms to charge a price and generate revenue, creating the profit incentive necessary for production.\n*   **Rivalry** (or being 'rival in consumption') means that one person's consumption of the good prevents or diminishes another person's ability to consume the same unit. This implies that there is a marginal cost associated with producing each unit for a new consumer. The market price mechanism works effectively to allocate these scarce, rivalrous goods to the consumers who value them most highly.\n\nBecause private goods are both excludable and rival, the forces of supply and demand can work together to determine an efficient price and quantity, leading to an optimal allocation of resources without the need for government intervention.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Excludable and non-rival**\nGoods that are excludable but non-rival are known as **club goods** (or toll goods), such as a subscription to a streaming service or access to a private park. While markets can provide these goods because excludability allows a price to be charged, it is not the most suitable or efficient case. Because the good is non-rival, the marginal cost of providing it to an additional consumer is typically zero or very low. However, to make a profit, a firm must charge a price higher than zero, which excludes potential consumers who value the good above its marginal cost but below the set price. This leads to an inefficient level of consumption (under-consumption).\n\n**C: Non-excludable and non-rival**\nGoods that are non-excludable and non-rival are known as **public goods**. National defence and street lighting are classic examples. The market is not at all suitable for providing public goods due to two problems:\n1.  **Non-excludability** leads to the **free-rider problem**, where individuals can consume the good without paying for it. This erodes the profit incentive for private firms to produce the good.\n2.  **Non-rivalry** means that providing the good to one person makes it available to everyone at no additional cost.\nConsequently, private markets will fail to provide public goods, or will severely under-provide them, necessitating government provision funded through taxation.\n\n**D: Non-excludable and rival**\nGoods that are non-excludable but rival are known as **common-pool resources**. Examples include fish in the open ocean or common grazing land. The market is also unsuitable for managing these goods. Because they are non-excludable, a price cannot be charged to control access. However, because they are rival, each person's use depletes the resource for others. This creates the **tragedy of the commons**, where individual self-interest leads to over-consumption and potential exhaustion of the resource. This is a form of market failure that typically requires government intervention, such as quotas, licenses, or property rights enforcement, to prevent depletion."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_2.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2  whatis the definition of long run?\na the time period when all factors of production are specialised\nb the time period when all factors of production are variable\nc the time period when all key inputs into production are variable\nd the time period when at least one factor of production is fixed", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn microeconomic theory, the **long run** is a conceptual period of time in which a firm can vary all of its inputs. There are no fixed factors of production; everything, including capital (such as plant size and machinery), labour, and land, is variable. This allows the firm to adjust its scale of operations, enter or exit an industry, and choose the most efficient production technology without the constraint of any unchangeable inputs. The actual calendar time that constitutes the \"long run\" is not fixed and differs significantly between industries.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. the time period when all factors of production are specialised**\nThis is incorrect because the specialisation of factors of production, such as the division of labour, is a feature of production processes that can occur in both the short run and the long run. The defining characteristic of the long run is not the specialisation of inputs but their variability.\n\n**C. the time period when all key inputs into production are variable**\nWhile this statement is similar to the correct definition, it is less precise. The term \"key inputs\" is ambiguous. The formal economic definition of the long run specifies that *all* factors of production are variable, not just a subset deemed \"key.\" The distinction is crucial for understanding concepts like economies of scale and long-run cost curves.\n\n**D. the time period when at least one factor of production is fixed**\nThis statement describes the **short run**, not the long run. The short run is defined as the period during which a firm's operations are constrained by at least one fixed factor of production, typically capital (e.g., the size of its factory). In the short run, a firm can only change its output by varying its variable inputs, such as labour and raw materials."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_3.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "3 the table states the consequences of two macroeconomic policies.\nwhat correctly identifies whether the statements are normative or positive?\na depreciation of an \u2014 -\n: a rise in the minimum\nexchange rate will :\nwage rate will cause\ncause the balance of ;\n: unemployment to rise\npayments to improve\na normative normative\nb normative positive\ncc positive normative\nd positive positive", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Rationale for the Correct Answer (D)\n\nA **positive statement** is an objective statement that can be tested, amended, or rejected by referring to the available evidence. It deals with cause-and-effect relationships and describes 'what is'. In contrast, a **normative statement** is a subjective statement of opinion or a value judgment. It describes 'what ought to be' and cannot be proven or disproven by facts alone.\n\n1.  **\"a depreciation of an exchange rate will cause the balance of payments to improve\"**: This is a **positive statement**. It puts forward a testable hypothesis about the relationship between the exchange rate and the balance of payments. Economic theory (such as the Marshall-Lerner condition and the J-curve effect) provides a framework for testing this claim. Economists can analyse empirical data to determine whether, and under what conditions, a currency depreciation leads to an improvement (i.e., a smaller deficit or a larger surplus) in the balance of payments. Although the word \"improve\" might suggest a value judgment, in this macroeconomic context, it refers to a specific, measurable outcome. The statement is about a potential economic consequence, not about whether that consequence is desirable.\n\n2.  **\"a rise in the minimum wage rate will cause unemployment to rise\"**: This is also a **positive statement**. It proposes a specific, testable cause-and-effect relationship. According to standard microeconomic models of the labour market, a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage level will lead to a surplus of labour (unemployment). This is a prediction that can be investigated by examining data before and after minimum wage increases. While economists may debate the magnitude or even the existence of this effect in the real world, the statement itself is a testable proposition, not a statement of opinion about whether the minimum wage should be raised.\n\nSince both statements are testable hypotheses about economic phenomena, they are both classified as positive.\n\n### Rationale for Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: (normative, normative)** This is incorrect because both statements are testable propositions about economic relationships, not subjective value judgments. They do not express an opinion on what policy *should* be pursued.\n\n*   **B: (normative, positive)** This is incorrect because the first statement is positive, not normative. It is a claim about a cause-and-effect relationship that can be empirically verified or refuted.\n\n*   **C: (positive, normative)** This is incorrect because the second statement is positive, not normative. It makes a factual claim about the consequences of a policy action, which can be tested against real-world evidence, rather than expressing an opinion on the desirability of the policy itself."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_4.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 the diagram shows the production possibility curve for wheat and corn.\nm\noutput\nof wheat\nn\noo output of corn\n\nwhat can be deduced from the diagram?\na_ as the price of corn falls, more of it is demanded.\nb_ resources used in producing corn are more efficient than in producing wheat.\nc_ the opportunity cost of producing corn falls when moving from m to n.\nd_ the opportunity cost of producing corn is constant when moving from m to n.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA Production Possibility Curve (PPC) illustrates the maximum potential output combinations of two goods that an economy can produce, given its available resources and technology are fully and efficiently employed. The slope of the PPC represents the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the PPC is a straight line (linear). A straight line has a constant slope. Therefore, as production moves from point M (all resources used for wheat) towards point N (all resources used for corn), a constant amount of wheat must be sacrificed to produce each additional unit of corn. This indicates a constant opportunity cost of producing corn.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This statement describes the law of demand, which relates the price of a good to the quantity demanded by consumers. The PPC is a supply-side model that shows production capabilities based on resource availability and technology; it does not provide any information about prices or consumer demand.\n\n**B:** The PPC shows the trade-offs in production, not the absolute efficiency of the resources in producing one good compared to another. While point M may represent a larger quantity than point N (or vice-versa), this does not imply that the resources (e.g., land, labour) are inherently more efficient in producing wheat. It simply shows the maximum output achievable if all resources are dedicated to that single good. The diagram does not provide enough information to make a comparison of resource efficiency between the two industries.\n\n**C:** A falling opportunity cost would be represented by a PPC that is bowed inwards (convex to the origin). This would mean that as more corn is produced, less wheat has to be given up for each additional unit of corn.

This relationship is graphically represented by any straight-line supply curve that originates from the origin (0,0). Along such a curve, any given percentage increase in price will lead to an identical percentage increase in the quantity supplied, maintaining a constant proportional relationship at all price levels.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This diagram illustrates perfectly inelastic supply (PES = 0). The supply curve is vertical, indicating that the quantity supplied is fixed and does not change at all, regardless of how much the price changes. Because the percentage change in quantity supplied is zero, the elasticity is zero.\n\n**B:** This diagram illustrates elastic supply (PES > 1). When a straight-line supply curve intersects the vertical price axis, it signifies that the percentage change in quantity supplied will always be greater than the percentage change in price. At any point on this curve, an increase in price leads to a more than proportionate increase in the quantity supplied.\n\n**D:** This diagram illustrates perfectly elastic supply (PES = \u221e). The supply curve is horizontal, indicating that suppliers are willing and able to supply any quantity at a single, specific price.

Public goods are defined by two key features: they are **non-rivalrous**, meaning one person's consumption does not reduce the availability of the good for others, and **non-excludable**, meaning it is not possible to prevent individuals who do not pay for the good from consuming it.\n\nBecause public goods are non-excludable, private firms cannot use the price system to provide them. This leads to the **free-rider problem**, where individuals can benefit from a good or service without contributing to its cost. Since firms cannot charge a price and exclude non-payers, they lack the profit motive to produce the good. Consequently, the free market would fail to provide public goods, and they are typically supplied by the government and financed through general taxation, not by a direct price for consumption. Examples include national defence and street lighting.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A:** Foodstuff is a **private good**. It is **rivalrous** (if one person consumes an item of food, no one else can consume that same item) and **excludable** (a seller can prevent a person from having the food if they do not pay). Because it is excludable, the price system is a very common and effective mechanism for allocating food among the population.\n\n*   **B:** The hiring of workers occurs in the **labour market**, where the wage rate is the price of labour. This market effectively uses the price system to allocate labour resources. Labour is **excludable** (an employer can choose not to hire a particular worker) and **rivalrous** (a worker employed in one full-time job cannot simultaneously be employed in another). Therefore, wages act as price signals that guide the allocation of workers to different jobs and industries.\n\n*   **C:** Land is a factor of production that is bought, sold, and rented through the property market, which is a clear application of the price system. Ownership of land is **excludable**, as legal titles and physical boundaries can prevent others from using it. It is also **rivalrous**, as using a piece of land for one purpose (e.g., growing wheat) prevents its simultaneous use for another purpose (e.g., building a factory).

PED is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\n*   **Inelastic demand** occurs when the absolute value of PED is less than 1, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price.\n*   **Elastic demand** occurs when the absolute value of PED is greater than 1, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is larger than the percentage change in price.\n*   **Unitary elastic demand** occurs when the absolute value of PED is exactly 1, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.\n\nFor the **cheaper seats**:\nThe price increased by 10%, and the demand fell by 5%.\nThe percentage change in quantity demanded (5%) is less than the percentage change in price (10%).\nTherefore, the PED is | -5% / 10% | = 0.5.

This creates an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, resulting in a downward-sloping demand curve.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It shows an inverse relationship between income and quantity demanded.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Firstly, it mischaracterises a normal good; an inverse relationship between income and quantity demanded is the definition of an *inferior good*. For a normal good, the relationship is positive (as income rises, demand increases). Secondly, the demand curve's shape is determined by the relationship between the good's price and quantity demanded, not income and quantity demanded.

This mismatch is universal and affects every individual and society, irrespective of their level of wealth. For a poor person, scarcity is acute and relates to the inability to afford basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. For a rich person, while basic needs are met, their wants still extend beyond their means. For example, they may desire more leisure time (time is a scarce resource), a unique piece of art that is not for sale, or to fund projects that exceed their vast but still limited fortune. Because wants are boundless and resources are always limited, everyone must make choices about how to allocate their resources, which is the essence of the economic problem.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The specific choices that individuals make are heavily dependent on their income and wealth. An individual's income level determines their budget constraint, which dictates the range and quality of goods and services they can afford. For example, a high-income individual might choose between purchasing a luxury car or investing in the stock market, while a low-income individual might choose between taking the bus or buying groceries. While scarcity forces everyone to make choices, the nature and scope of those choices are fundamentally shaped by income inequalities.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nWhile consumers in a competitive market may face the same nominal price for a specific good or service, this does not explain why scarcity affects both the rich and the poor. Scarcity is not about the price of goods but about the limited resources (such as income) available to purchase them. A rich person and a poor person have vastly different capacities to purchase goods and services, even at the same prices. The core issue is that their income, although different in magnitude, is finite and insufficient to satisfy all their potential wants. Therefore, the limitation on resources, not the uniformity of prices, is the reason scarcity is a universal problem.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThe uneven distribution of natural resources amongst nations is an example of scarcity on a macroeconomic and global scale. It helps explain why some countries have different production capacities and levels of wealth. However, it does not address the fundamental reason why scarcity applies to *individuals* within those nations. Even if resources were distributed perfectly evenly among all people, the problem of scarcity would persist. This is because each individual's wants are considered infinite, and they would still exceed any finite allocation of resources. The core of the economic problem lies in the relationship between unlimited wants and limited resources at the individual level, not just in the pattern of resource distribution at the national level."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_11.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "11 butter and buttermilk are goods in joint supply. supply curves in both markets slope upwards to\nthe right. health concerns cause people to reduce their consumption of butter.\nwhat are the initial consequences of this for supply in the markets for butter and buttermilk?\n| | supply of butter supply of buttermilk\na move left along supply curve move left along supply curve\nb move left along supply curve shift left of the supply curve\ncc shift left of the supply curve move left along supply curve\nd shift left of the supply curve shift left of the supply curve", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe initial event is a decrease in the demand for butter due to health concerns. This is represented by a leftward shift of the demand curve for butter. This demand shift leads to a lower equilibrium price for butter. In response to this lower price, butter producers will reduce their output, which is shown as a movement down and to the left along the existing supply curve for butter (a decrease in the quantity supplied).\n\nButter and buttermilk are in joint supply, meaning they are produced together. As the production of butter decreases, the production of buttermilk, its by-product, will also necessarily decrease.

A movement along the buttermilk supply curve would be caused by a change in the price of buttermilk.

The change in the supply of butter is a movement along its supply curve in response to a price change, not a shift of the curve. A shift would be caused by a change in production costs or technology. The change in the supply of buttermilk is a shift of the curve, not a movement along it, as explained above.\n\n*   **D: shift left of the supply curve (butter) / shift left of the supply curve (buttermilk)**\n    This option is incorrect because the initial shock affects the demand for butter, not its supply conditions. A shift in the supply curve for butter would mean that producers are willing to supply less at every price, perhaps due to higher input costs.

Producer surplus is the difference between the amount producers actually receive for selling a good (the market price) and the minimum amount they would have been willing to accept for it. The supply curve (S) shows this minimum willingness to accept. Area `y` is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price P. This is not what the question asks for.\n\n**C. x + y**\nThe area `x + y` represents the total economic surplus, also known as community surplus or total welfare. It is the sum of the consumer surplus (`x`) and the producer surplus (`y`). This area measures the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of the good at the equilibrium output. The question asks for a specific difference, not the total sum of these two surpluses.\n\n**D. x - y**\nThis calculation represents the difference between the consumer surplus and the producer surplus. This value does not correspond to any standard single economic concept represented in the question's phrasing. The question asks for the difference between consumers' total willingness to pay and producers' total revenue, which is equal to the consumer surplus (`x`), not the difference between consumer and producer surplus (`x - y`)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_13.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13 why do some local governments subsidise the provision of bicycles to encourage their use?\na consumers are afraid of having car accidents.\nb consumers are unable to afford bicycles.\nc consumers are not aware of the external benefits of using bicycles.\nd consumers ignore the external costs of using bicycles.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe use of bicycles generates positive externalities, which are benefits to third parties not directly involved in the consumption or production of the good. These external benefits include reduced traffic congestion, lower air and noise pollution, and improved public health, which lessens the burden on the healthcare system.\n\nIndividual consumers, when deciding whether to use a bicycle, typically only consider their private benefits (e.g., personal health improvement, cost savings on transport) and private costs (e.g., purchase price, physical effort). They do not account for the wider benefits their choice confers upon society. This information failure leads to the marginal social benefit (MSB) of bicycle use being greater than the marginal private benefit (MPB). Consequently, in a free market, bicycles will be under-consumed relative to the socially optimal level.\n\nA government subsidy lowers the effective price for the consumer, increasing their private benefit or reducing their private cost. This encourages more people to use bicycles, moving the level of consumption closer to the socially efficient quantity where MSB equals the marginal social cost (MSC).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Consumers are afraid of having car accidents.**\nThis relates to the private costs and benefits of using a car, not a bicycle. A consumer's fear is a personal consideration that influences their individual decision-making. It does not represent a market failure that requires a subsidy for an alternative good. A government subsidy is a policy tool designed to correct for inefficient resource allocation caused by externalities, not to manage individual consumer fears.\n\n**B. Consumers are unable to afford bicycles.**\nWhile a subsidy does make bicycles more affordable, the primary economic justification for subsidising a specific good is typically to correct a market failure, not to address income inequality. If the main policy goal were to help low-income individuals, a direct income transfer would be a more efficient and targeted approach, as it allows consumers to spend the money according to their own needs and preferences. Subsidising bicycles specifically points to a belief that the good itself has benefits that are not fully realised by the market, i.e., positive externalities.\n\n**D. Consumers ignore the external costs of using bicycles.**\nThis is incorrect because the use of bicycles is overwhelmingly associated with external *benefits*, not external *costs*. An external cost (or negative externality) would be a harm imposed on a third party. If bicycles did generate significant external costs that consumers ignored, the appropriate government intervention would be a tax to discourage their use, not a subsidy to encourage it.

Country P has an income Gini coefficient of 0.6, while country Q has an income Gini coefficient of 0.5.

Gini coefficients are not comparable between income and wealth because one is a flow concept and the other is a stock concept.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect.

This points towards a supply-side policy, which aims to improve the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nAn increase in laws to promote competition is a supply-side policy. By encouraging more firms to enter markets and compete, it creates pressure on existing firms to become more efficient, reduce their costs, and lower their prices to attract customers. This increase in efficiency and competition shifts the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curves to the right. A rightward shift in aggregate supply leads to a lower average price level (reducing inflation) and an increase in real output. Therefore, this action meets both of the government's objectives.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. an increase in taxation:**\nThis is a contractionary fiscal policy. An increase in taxes, such as income tax or corporation tax, reduces the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms. This leads to a decrease in consumption and investment, which are key components of aggregate demand (AD). The resulting leftward shift of the AD curve will reduce inflationary pressure by lowering the price level. However, it will also cause a contraction in economic activity, leading to a fall in real output and potentially higher unemployment. This fails to meet the objective of avoiding a fall in output.\n\n**C. an increase in the budget surplus:**\nAn increase in the budget surplus is achieved by either increasing tax revenue, decreasing government spending, or a combination of both. These are components of contractionary fiscal policy. Similar to an increase in taxation, reducing government spending or increasing taxes will decrease aggregate demand (AD), shifting the AD curve to the left. While this is effective in curbing demand-pull inflation, it does so at the expense of economic growth, causing a fall in real output. Thus, this option does not meet the government's dual objectives.\n\n**D. an increase in the exchange rate:**\nAn increase (appreciation) in the exchange rate makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive. Cheaper imports of raw materials can lower production costs, shifting the SRAS curve to the right and reducing cost-push inflation. However, the appreciation also reduces the international competitiveness of the country's exports while making imports more attractive to domestic consumers. This leads to a fall in net exports (X-M), which is a component of aggregate demand (AD). The resulting leftward shift of the AD curve would cause a fall in real output, contradicting the government's objective.

The vertical axis represents the number of US dollars that can be exchanged for one pound sterling. Between the beginning of 2001 and the beginning of 2003, the line on the graph shows a general upward trend, rising from approximately US$1.425 to over US$1.600. This indicates that one pound could buy more US dollars in 2003 than in 2001.

Imports (M) are a withdrawal (or leakage), as they represent domestic spending on foreign goods and services. The equilibrium level of national income is affected by the net effect of exports and imports (X-M). If exports exceed imports (a trade surplus), there is a net injection, which tends to increase national income. Conversely, if imports exceed exports (a trade deficit), there is a net withdrawal, which tends to decrease national income. Exports and imports only \"cancel each other out\" and have no net effect on national income if the value of exports is exactly equal to the value of imports (X=M), which is not always the case.\n\n*   **Option B is incorrect.** Saving (S) is a withdrawal from the circular flow, while investment (I) is an injection. In equilibrium, planned withdrawals must equal planned injections (S+T+M = I+G+X). However, a high level of saving does not automatically cause a high level of investment. The decisions to save are primarily made by households, based on factors like income and interest rates. The decisions to invest are made by firms, based on factors like interest rates, technology, and business confidence. While savings provide the funds available for investment, there is no mechanism that ensures they *must* be equal outside of the equilibrium condition. A high level of saving without a corresponding high level of investment (S > I) would lead to a fall in national income.\n\n*   **Option C is correct.** Savings represent income that has been withdrawn from the circular flow. When consumers use these past savings to finance current spending, this is known as dissaving. This action increases consumption (C), a key component of aggregate demand. The increase in spending acts as an injection (or a reduction in withdrawals) into the circular flow. This additional demand for goods and services stimulates production, leading to a rise in the equilibrium level of national income, output, and employment.\n\n*   **Option D is incorrect.** An increase in the rate of income tax increases government tax revenue (T), which is a withdrawal from the circular flow of income. Ceteris paribus, an increase in a withdrawal will cause total withdrawals to exceed total injections, leading to a fall in the equilibrium level of national income. The statement claims there *must* be an equivalent increase in injections. This is not an automatic outcome of the circular flow model. It is a description of a compensatory policy action that a government *could* take (e.g., by increasing government spending, G) to prevent national income from falling. However, there is no economic law that requires this to happen.

It fell in only two years.**\nThis is incorrect. The general price level falls only when the inflation rate is negative.

Wages are a significant component of production costs. The statement specifies that wages are rising. As firms face higher labour costs, they often pass these on to consumers by increasing the prices of their goods and services to maintain their profit margins. This process directly leads to cost-push inflation.\n\n2.  **Rise in real incomes:** Real income measures the purchasing power of nominal income after accounting for inflation. It is calculated by adjusting nominal income for changes in the price level. The scenario states that wages (nominal income) are rising faster than prices (inflation). When the rate of increase in nominal wages is greater than the rate of inflation, the purchasing power of consumers increases. Therefore, real incomes are rising.\n\nSince rising wages contribute to cost-push inflation and are also rising faster than prices, both features are present in this economy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because it negates both features that are likely to exist. Rising wages are a direct cause of cost-push inflation, as they increase firms' production costs. Furthermore, real incomes will rise, not fall or stagnate, because the rate of wage growth is explicitly stated to be higher than the rate of price increases. This means the purchasing power of wages is increasing.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because it fails to identify the presence of cost-push inflation. While it correctly states that real incomes are rising (since wages are rising faster than prices), it wrongly suggests that cost-push inflation is not occurring. A significant rise in wages, which is a key cost of production, is a primary driver of cost-push inflation. Therefore, it is highly likely that the economy is experiencing cost-push inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because it wrongly claims there is no rise in real incomes. It correctly identifies that rising wages will lead to cost-push inflation. However, it fails to recognise the effect on real incomes.

This is because they can earn a higher rate of return on their savings and investments (e.g., in government bonds or bank deposits). To purchase these domestic assets, foreign investors must first buy the domestic currency, which increases the demand for the currency on the foreign exchange market. According to the laws of supply and demand, an increase in the demand for a currency, ceteris paribus, will cause its price (the exchange rate) to rise, leading to an appreciation. This inflow of short-term speculative capital is often referred to as 'hot money'.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a fall in its direct taxes**\nA fall in direct taxes, such as income tax, increases the disposable income of households. This typically leads to a rise in consumer spending. A portion of this increased spending will be on imported goods and services. To pay for these imports, domestic residents must sell their own currency to buy foreign currency.

This is caused by a change in a non-price determinant of demand. A movement along the supply curve occurs when the quantity supplied changes in response to a change in the price (the exchange rate), which is itself caused by the initial shift in demand.\n\n**Option B is correct** because it describes a scenario that leads to exactly this sequence of events. If foreign speculators believe the US dollar (US$) is undervalued, they anticipate its value will rise in the future. To profit from this expected appreciation, they will buy US$ now while it is relatively cheap. This speculative buying increases the overall demand for the US$. Since this change in demand is driven by expectations (a non-price determinant), it causes the entire demand curve for the US$ to shift to the right. This initial shift puts upward pressure on the exchange rate. As the value of the US$ rises, foreign goods and assets become cheaper for US residents. In response to this higher exchange rate, US residents will supply a greater quantity of US$ to the market to purchase more foreign goods and assets. This increase in the quantity supplied, driven by the change in the exchange rate, is represented as an upward movement along the original supply curve.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The US government reduces subsidies on exports to the EU.**\nReducing a subsidy on US exports makes these goods more expensive for buyers in the European Union. Consequently, the demand for these US exports would likely fall. To purchase fewer US exports, EU buyers would require fewer US dollars, leading to a *decrease* in the demand for the US$. This would be represented by a shift of the demand curve to the *left*, not to the right.\n\n**C: The US government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so as to bring about a drop in the value of the US$.**\nFor a government or central bank to cause a drop (depreciation) in its own currency's value, it must increase the supply of that currency on the foreign exchange market. It does this by selling its own currency (US$) and buying foreign currencies. This action would cause the *supply curve* for the US$ to shift to the right, not the demand curve. The question specifies a shift in demand and a movement along supply.\n\n**D: US pharmaceutical companies experience a fall in demand for their products from the rest of the world.**\nUS pharmaceuticals are a significant export. A fall in foreign demand for these products means that foreigners need fewer US dollars to pay for them.

By definition, this ratio measures the quantity of imports a country can acquire in exchange for a single unit of its exports. Therefore, the terms of trade directly represent the purchasing power of a country's exports. An improvement (increase) in the terms of trade means that for the same volume of exports, a country can now purchase a greater volume of imports, indicating that the purchasing power of its exports has risen.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. its balance of payments performance**\nThe balance of payments performance, particularly the current account balance, is determined by the total value of exports minus the total value of imports. Value is calculated as price multiplied by quantity. While the terms of trade reflect the relationship between export and import *prices*, it provides no information about the *quantities* traded. An improvement in the terms of trade (e.g., higher export prices) could worsen the current account if the demand for exports is price elastic, leading to a more than proportionate fall in export quantity. Therefore, knowledge of the terms of trade alone is insufficient to determine the balance of payments performance.\n\n**C. the standard of living within the country**\nWhile a change in the terms of trade can *influence* the standard of living, it is not a direct or sole determinant. An improvement in the terms of trade can potentially raise the standard of living by making imports more affordable. However, the standard of living is a broader concept that also depends on factors such as national income, employment levels, income distribution, and the provision of public services. Furthermore, the cause of the change in the terms of trade matters. For instance, if the terms of trade improve because import prices have fallen due to a global recession, this might be accompanied by a fall in export demand, leading to lower national income and potentially a lower standard of living. Thus, the terms of trade alone do not provide a complete understanding of the standard of living.\n\n**D. the value of its real exchange rate**\nThe terms of trade and the real exchange rate are distinct, though related, concepts. The real exchange rate compares the general price levels of goods and services (both traded and non-traded) between two countries. In contrast, the terms of trade specifically compares the prices of a country's *exported* goods to its *imported* goods. While factors like a change in the nominal exchange rate can affect both measures, they can also move independently. For example, a global surge in the price of a specific commodity that a country exports would improve its terms of trade, but it might not cause a significant immediate change in its real exchange rate, which is based on broader price indices. Therefore, knowing the terms of trade does not reveal the value of the real exchange rate."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_25.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 acompany produces goods for export only.\nwhich change could cause a rise in the price of its goods while the quantity sold is unchanged?\ndomestic foreign\nworkers\u2019 consumers\u2019\nwages wages\na unchanged fall\nb fall unchanged\ncc fall fall\nd rise rise", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA rise in the price of a good combined with an unchanged quantity sold requires a simultaneous shift in both the supply and demand curves.\n\nA rise in the wages of domestic workers increases the company's cost of production.

Assuming the good is a normal good, this increase in income will lead to an increase in demand, causing the demand curve to shift to the right. A rightward shift in demand puts upward pressure on both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n\nWhen both events occur simultaneously, the upward pressure on price from both the supply and demand shifts is compounded, resulting in a definite increase in the equilibrium price. The effect on quantity is ambiguous: the decrease in supply pushes quantity down, while the increase in demand pushes it up. It is possible for these two opposing effects on quantity to cancel each other out, resulting in the equilibrium quantity remaining unchanged. Therefore, this combination of changes can cause the price to rise while the quantity sold is unchanged.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Unchanged domestic workers' wages mean there is no change in the company's costs of production, so the supply curve does not shift.

This situation presents a significant dilemma for demand-side policies. Expansionary demand-side policies aimed at reducing unemployment would likely worsen inflation, while contractionary demand-side policies aimed at controlling inflation would likely increase unemployment.\n\nSupply-side policies are uniquely suited to address stagflation. By increasing the economy's productive capacity and efficiency, they shift the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. This leads to an increase in real national output, which helps to reduce unemployment. Simultaneously, an increase in aggregate supply puts downward pressure on the general price level, thereby combating inflation. Because they can tackle both high unemployment and rising prices at the same time, supply-side measures are the most effective policy tool under these conditions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **A: High unemployment, stable price level.** This scenario describes a recessionary or deflationary gap where the primary problem is insufficient aggregate demand. While long-term supply-side policies can contribute to job creation, a more direct and often faster solution would be expansionary demand-side policies (e.g., lower interest rates or increased government spending). Since the price level is stable, the risk of such policies causing significant inflation is minimal, making them a more probable choice.\n\n*   **C: Low unemployment, stable price level.** This scenario represents an economy operating at or near its full employment level with price stability. The key macroeconomic goals are largely being met. In this situation, there is no pressing economic problem that requires an immediate, large-scale policy intervention. While governments may continue to implement supply-side reforms for long-term growth, they are not the most likely measures to be used to solve a current macroeconomic imbalance, as none exists.\n\n*   **D: Low unemployment, rising price level.** This scenario is characteristic of an economy experiencing demand-pull inflation, where aggregate demand exceeds the economy's productive capacity. The most direct policy response to cool down an overheating economy and curb inflation is to use contractionary demand-side policies (e.g., raising interest rates or taxes) to reduce aggregate demand.

Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank is obliged to use its monetary policy tools, primarily interest rates, to maintain the currency's pegged value. For instance, if the currency is under pressure to depreciate, the central bank might have to raise interest rates to attract foreign capital and support the currency, even if the domestic economy is weak and would benefit from lower interest rates. With a floating exchange rate, the currency's value is determined by market forces, freeing the central bank to set interest rates to achieve domestic objectives such as controlling inflation or stimulating economic growth, without being constrained by the need to defend a specific exchange rate target.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B:** This is incorrect. A floating exchange rate system reduces the need for a government to hold large foreign exchange reserves. Reserves are primarily used in fixed or managed exchange rate systems to intervene in the foreign exchange market\u2014selling foreign currency to support the domestic currency or buying foreign currency to prevent it from appreciating too much. Since a purely floating rate is determined by the market without intervention, the necessity to maintain extensive reserves for this purpose is diminished.\n\n*   **C:** This statement is the opposite of what occurs. A floating exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand in the free market, which can be highly volatile due to changes in trade flows, capital movements, and speculation. Therefore, floating exchange rates are often associated with short-term instability and fluctuations. It is a fixed exchange rate system that attempts to eliminate this type of market instability by pegging the currency's value.\n\n*   **D:** This is incorrect. The volatility inherent in a floating exchange rate system creates uncertainty for firms engaged in international trade and investment. An importer buying goods or an exporter selling goods cannot be certain of the future domestic currency value of their transactions. This exchange rate risk can complicate planning and may reduce confidence in future costs and profitability.

A government budget surplus occurs when tax revenue exceeds government expenditure. By increasing expenditure or decreasing tax revenue, expansionary fiscal policy will either reduce an existing budget surplus or create/increase a budget deficit (where expenditure exceeds revenue). Therefore, a rise in the budget surplus is the least likely outcome; in fact, a fall is the intended and expected result.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. aggregate demand**\nExpansionary fiscal policy is specifically designed to increase aggregate demand (AD). AD is calculated as C + I + G + (X-M). An increase in government spending (G) is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, which directly raises AD. A reduction in taxes increases the disposable income of households, leading to higher consumption (C), and increases the post-tax profits of firms, which can stimulate investment (I). Both of these effects lead to a rise in aggregate demand.\n\n**C. nominal income**\nAn increase in aggregate demand, resulting from expansionary fiscal policy, encourages firms to increase their output to meet the higher level of spending. This rise in production leads to an increase in the demand for factors of production, such as labour and capital. Consequently, national income, in the form of wages, profits, and rents, will rise. Nominal income, which is national income measured at current price levels, is therefore very likely to increase as a result of the policy.\n\n**D. inflation**\nInflation is a sustained increase in the general price level. Expansionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right. If the economy is operating near or at its full employment capacity, the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve will be upward-sloping or vertical. In this situation, the increase in AD will pull up the general price level, leading to demand-pull inflation.

However, the rate of this growth has fallen from 5.0% to 0.95%.

Firstly, it dampens domestic aggregate demand (expenditure-dampening effect), which reduces demand for imports. Secondly, it leads to an appreciation of the currency (expenditure-switching effect). Price-elastic demand for exports relates to the second channel.\n\nAn increase in domestic interest rates attracts foreign financial capital, increasing the demand for the domestic currency and causing the exchange rate to appreciate. This appreciation makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers. If the demand for these exports is price-elastic (i.e., the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1), the percentage decrease in the quantity of exports demanded will be greater than the percentage increase in their price. Consequently, the total value of export revenue will fall. A decrease in export revenue worsens the current account balance, thereby counteracting the intended improvement from reduced import spending. This significantly reduces the overall effectiveness of the policy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a fall in domestic growth**\n\nThis would not reduce the policy's effectiveness; rather, it is a part of the mechanism through which the policy is intended to work. Raising interest rates is an expenditure-dampening policy designed to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive, which reduces consumption and investment. This slowdown in domestic growth and income is what leads to a reduction in spending on imports, thereby helping to improve the current account balance. Therefore, a fall in domestic growth is a sign that the policy is working as intended, not a factor that reduces its effectiveness.\n\n**B. consumer pessimism**\n\nConsumer pessimism implies that households are worried about the future economic outlook and are likely to reduce their spending and increase their savings. A reduction in consumer spending would lower aggregate demand, including the demand for imported goods. This effect would reinforce the government's policy of raising interest rates to curb spending. As both consumer pessimism and higher interest rates lead to lower import expenditure, this would make the policy more effective, not less, in improving the current account.\n\n**C. increased domestic saving**\n\nIncreased domestic saving is the direct consequence of reduced domestic consumption. When households save more, they spend less on all goods and services, including imports. This reduction in import expenditure contributes directly to improving the current account balance (by reducing the value of imports, M, in the X-M calculation). Therefore, an increase in domestic saving supports the policy's objective and enhances its effectiveness, rather than reducing it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_31.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "1. why does a production possibility curve exist for every economy?\na_ resources are unlimited.\nb_ resources have alternative uses.\nc_ some resources can be imported.\nd some resources may be unemployed.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation\n\n**B. Resources have alternative uses.**\n\nThe existence of a production possibility curve (PPC) is fundamentally rooted in the economic concepts of scarcity and choice. A PPC illustrates the maximum possible combinations of two goods or services that an economy can produce, given its available resources and technology, when all resources are fully and efficiently employed. The curve demonstrates the trade-off that an economy faces when deciding what to produce.\n\nThis trade-off arises precisely because resources (such as land, labour, and capital) have alternative uses. For example, a plot of land can be used to grow wheat or to build a factory. A worker can be employed in car manufacturing or in textile production. Because these resources are versatile, an economy must make a choice about how to allocate them. If more resources are allocated to producing one good, fewer resources are available to produce the other, leading to an opportunity cost. The PPC graphically represents all the possible outcomes of these allocation choices. Without alternative uses for resources, there would be no trade-off to illustrate and thus no PPC.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Resources are unlimited.**\n\nThis statement is the direct opposite of the primary assumption upon which the PPC is based. The core economic problem is scarcity, which means that resources are finite or limited, while human wants are infinite. It is because resources are scarce that an economy cannot produce unlimited quantities of all goods. The PPC, or production possibility *frontier*, represents the boundary or limit of production. If resources were unlimited, there would be no production limit, no need to make choices between goods, and no opportunity cost. Consequently, the concept of a PPC would be meaningless.\n\n**C. Some resources can be imported.**\n\nThe ability to import resources can increase an economy's overall productive capacity. This would be represented by an outward shift of the entire PPC, as the economy now has more inputs available for production. However, the ability to import affects the *position* of the curve, not the reason for its existence. A PPC exists even for a closed economy that does not engage in international trade. The curve is a model of how an economy allocates its *own* scarce resources, regardless of their origin.\n\n**D. Some resources may be unemployed.**\n\nThe PPC itself represents the maximum potential output of an economy when all resources are fully and efficiently employed. Any point on the curve signifies productive efficiency. If some resources are unemployed (e.g., workers without jobs, idle factories), the economy will be operating at a point *inside* the PPC. This indicates that the economy is not reaching its full potential output. Therefore, the possibility of unemployment explains why an economy might be producing at an inefficient level below its frontier, but it does not explain why the frontier (the curve itself) exists. The curve's existence is due to resource scarcity and the need to make choices, not the potential for inefficiency."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_32.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 which statement is a normative statement?\na aggregate demand will increase following a decrease in interest rates.\nb_ arise in unemployment will decrease inflationary pressures.\nc_ the incentive to work will rise if benefit payments are reduced.\nd_ unsustainable economic growth is more harmful to the economy than hyperinflation.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA normative statement is an assertion based on value judgments, opinions, or beliefs. It describes what *should be* or what is considered desirable, rather than what can be objectively verified with data. These statements often include words like 'should', 'ought', 'better', 'worse', or, as in this case, 'more harmful'.\n\nThe statement, \"Unsustainable economic growth is more harmful to the economy than hyperinflation,\" is a normative statement because it makes a subjective comparison. Whether one economic problem is \"more harmful\" than another is a matter of opinion and depends on the specific criteria used for judgment (e.g., impact on income distribution, long-term stability, social cohesion). It is a value-based claim that cannot be proven or disproven by economic data alone.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Aggregate demand will increase following a decrease in interest rates.**\nThis is a positive statement. It posits a testable, cause-and-effect relationship based on established economic theory. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for consumers and firms, which is expected to stimulate consumption and investment, thereby increasing aggregate demand. This prediction can be empirically tested by analysing economic data.\n\n**B. A rise in unemployment will decrease inflationary pressures.**\nThis is a positive statement that describes the relationship often illustrated by the Phillips Curve. The theory suggests that higher unemployment leads to lower aggregate demand and reduced bargaining power for workers, which in turn slows down wage growth and price increases. This is a hypothesis that can be supported or refuted with empirical evidence.\n\n**C. The incentive to work will rise if benefit payments are reduced.**\nThis is a positive statement concerning economic incentives. It proposes a specific behavioural response to a change in policy. The idea that reducing unemployment benefits increases the opportunity cost of not working, thus encouraging people to find jobs, is a testable hypothesis.

This problem arises because human wants are unlimited, meaning people always desire more goods and services than they currently have. In contrast, the resources, or factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise), required to produce these goods and services are finite, or limited in supply. This fundamental conflict between unlimited wants and limited resources forces societies and individuals to make choices about how to allocate these scarce resources, which is the central focus of the study of economics.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. resources: limited, wants: limited**\nThis combination does not describe the economic problem. While it correctly identifies that resources are limited, it incorrectly states that wants are also limited. The core premise of economics is that human wants are insatiable and therefore unlimited. If wants were limited and could be fully satisfied by the available resources, the problem of scarcity would not arise, and there would be no need for economic decision-making regarding allocation.\n\n**C. resources: unlimited, wants: limited**\nThis option incorrectly describes both components of the economic problem. Resources are fundamentally scarce and limited, not unlimited. If resources were infinite, it would be possible to produce an endless supply of goods and services. Furthermore, human wants are considered unlimited, not limited. This scenario represents the opposite of the actual economic problem.\n\n**D. resources: unlimited, wants: unlimited**\nThis combination is incorrect because it fails to recognise the scarcity of resources.

Examples include national defence, street lighting, and flood control systems. Due to the non-excludable nature of these goods, a 'free-rider' problem arises. Individuals have an incentive to consume the good without paying for it, assuming others will pay. Consequently, private firms have no profit motive to supply public goods, as they cannot charge consumers for their use and cover their costs. This leads to a 'missing market' where the good is not supplied at all, despite being socially desirable. This complete failure of the market to provide essential goods is the most fundamental reason why an economy cannot rely solely on market forces and requires government intervention for their provision.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) Demerit goods will be over supplied.**\nThis statement is correct in its economic reasoning but does not represent the main reason an economy cannot rely solely on the market. Demerit goods, such as cigarettes and alcohol, are associated with negative externalities and information failure, leading the free market to over-produce and over-consume them relative to the socially optimal level. While this represents a significant market failure requiring government intervention (e.g., through taxation or regulation), the market does in fact supply these goods. The problem is one of inefficient allocation (over-supply), not a complete absence of provision.\n\n**B) Merit goods will be under supplied.**\nThis statement is also correct in its economic reasoning but is not the primary reason for abandoning a pure market system. Merit goods, like education and healthcare, are associated with positive externalities and information failure, causing the free market to under-produce and under-consume them. The government may intervene to subsidise or directly provide them to correct this under-allocation. However, as with demerit goods, the market mechanism still functions to provide merit goods to some extent. The issue is an inefficient allocation (under-supply), which is less severe than the complete non-provision of public goods.\n\n**C) Private goods will not be supplied.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Private goods are both rivalrous and excludable. These characteristics are precisely what allow the price mechanism and market forces to work effectively. Firms can charge a price, prevent non-payers from consuming the good, and earn a profit. Therefore, the free market is highly efficient at allocating and supplying private goods.

Because resources such as time and money are scarce, choosing one option means giving up the opportunity to pursue another. In this scenario, the resource being used is $20. By choosing to spend this money on sports shoes, the person forgoes the benefit they would have received from using that same $20 to purchase the next most desirable item or service. Therefore, the opportunity cost is the value of the single best alternative that was sacrificed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. all the other things the person could have bought**\nThis is incorrect because opportunity cost refers to the *next best* alternative, not the sum of all possible alternatives. The $20 could only be spent on one of the other options, not all of them simultaneously. Economics assumes a rational consumer would have chosen the single alternative that would have provided the most satisfaction (utility), and it is the value of this specific forgone alternative that represents the true opportunity cost.\n\n**B. the cost of getting to the sports shop**\nThis is incorrect. Costs such as transport or time spent traveling to a store are known as transaction costs. While they are part of the total expense of acquiring the good, they are distinct from the opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is about the benefit lost from the best alternative use of the $20 itself, not the supplementary costs incurred to make the purchase.\n\n**C. the current value of the person's old pair of shoes**\nThis is incorrect because the value of an existing asset is not the opportunity cost of acquiring a new one. The opportunity cost relates to the allocation of the scarce resource ($20) being used for the new purchase. The value of the old shoes might influence the decision to buy new ones, but it does not represent the alternative that was forgone by spending the $20.

For a want to become economically significant, it must be 'effective'. **Effective demand** is defined as the desire for a good or service that is backed by the necessary purchasing power, or the ability to pay. Without the financial means to make a purchase, a consumer's desire does not translate into a market transaction and therefore does not influence producers' decisions. Thus, effective demand consists of both the willingness and the ability to buy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: demand that is speculative**\nSpeculative demand is a specific type of demand where goods or assets are purchased not for consumption, but with the expectation that their price will rise, allowing for them to be sold at a profit in the future. While speculative demand must be 'effective' (i.e., the speculator must have the money to buy the asset), it is only one category of demand. The term 'effective demand' is a broader, more fundamental concept that applies to all forms of demand (for consumption, investment, etc.) that are supported by purchasing power.\n\n**C: the relationship between price and quantity demanded**\nThis phrase describes the law of demand or the demand curve. The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises. This describes the behaviour of demand in response to price changes, illustrating the inverse relationship between the two variables. It is a fundamental principle related to demand but is not the definition of what makes demand 'effective'.\n\n**D: the total amount demanded by consumers**\nThis phrase defines market demand, which is the sum of all individual quantities demanded by consumers for a particular good or service at a specific price. In a macroeconomic context, it could also refer to aggregate demand, which is the total demand for all final goods and services in an economy.

This is determined by analysing the three given elasticity values:\n\n1.  **Income Elasticity of Demand (YED):** The YED is -0.4. A negative YED indicates that as consumer income rises, the quantity demanded for the good falls. This inverse relationship between income and demand is the defining characteristic of an **inferior good**.\n\n2.  **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** The PED is -2.4. To determine if demand is elastic or inelastic, we consider the absolute value of the PED. The absolute value of -2.4 is 2.4. Since this value is greater than 1 (|PED| > 1), the demand for good X is **price-elastic**. This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price.\n\n3.  **Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED):** The XED of good X with respect to good Y is +0.8. A positive XED indicates that the two goods are **substitutes**. This means that if the price of good Y increases, consumers will switch to buying more of good X, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded for good X.\n\nCombining these three points confirms that good X is an inferior good, has price-elastic demand, and is a substitute for good Y.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: inferior good, price-inelastic demand and complement to good Y**\nThis option is incorrect because it misinterprets both the price elasticity and cross elasticity of demand. The demand for good X is price-elastic (|\u20132.4| > 1), not price-inelastic. Furthermore, good X is a substitute for good Y (XED = +0.8), not a complement (which would require a negative XED).\n\n**C: normal good, price-elastic demand and complement to good Y**\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the type of good and its relationship with good Y. The negative income elasticity (YED = -0.4) means good X is an inferior good, not a normal good (which would have a positive YED). Additionally, the positive cross elasticity (XED = +0.8) indicates a substitute relationship, not a complementary one.\n\n**D: normal good, price-inelastic demand and substitute for good Y**\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the type of good and the nature of its price elasticity.

The term (\u0394Q/\u0394P) is the reciprocal of the slope of the demand curve. Since curves X and Y are parallel, they have the same slope (\u0394P/\u0394Q), and therefore the term (\u0394Q/\u0394P) is identical for both curves.\n\nHowever, elasticity is also dependent on the specific price (P) and quantity (Q) point on the curve. For any given price level, the quantity demanded on curve Y is greater than the quantity demanded on curve X (Q_Y > Q_X). This means that for any price P, the ratio P/Q will be larger for curve X than for curve Y.\n\nSince (\u0394Q/\u0394P) is the same for both, and the ratio (P/Q) is always greater for X at any given price, the price elasticity of demand for X will be higher than that of Y at every price.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: Both X and Y are unit price elastic over their whole length.**\nThis is incorrect. For any downward-sloping straight-line demand curve, the price elasticity of demand is not constant. It varies along the curve. The upper half of the curve is price elastic (PED > 1), the midpoint is unit price elastic (PED = 1), and the lower half is price inelastic (PED < 1). Only a demand curve shaped as a rectangular hyperbola has a constant unit elasticity.\n\n**B: Both X and Y have the same elasticity at every price.**\nThis is incorrect. While the two demand curves have the same slope, elasticity is not the same as slope. As explained for the correct answer (C), elasticity also depends on the ratio of price to quantity (P/Q). Since at any given price the quantity demanded is different for X and Y, their elasticities at that price must also be different.\n\n**D: Y is more likely to have substitutes than X.**\nThis is incorrect. The availability of close substitutes is a major determinant of price elasticity of demand. A good with more substitutes will have a higher PED because consumers can easily switch to alternatives if the price increases.

By increasing the minimum wage, the government raises the income of the lowest-paid workers who retain their jobs. This directly compresses the wage distribution from the bottom up, leading to a reduction in the degree of income inequality.\n\n2.  **Impact on Employment:** According to standard microeconomic theory, the demand for labour is downward-sloping. When the price of labour (the wage rate) is artificially increased above the equilibrium level, firms will reduce their quantity of labour demanded because it is now more expensive to hire workers. While the supply of labour may increase at this higher wage, the level of employment is determined by the number of jobs firms are willing to offer. The result is a contraction in the quantity of labour demanded and thus a fall in the overall level of employment, creating or exacerbating unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** Reducing the rate of income tax for the lowest band of earners would increase their disposable income, thereby reducing post-tax income inequality. However, this policy would likely increase the level of employment. A lower tax rate increases the incentive for individuals to seek work or work more hours, as they keep a larger proportion of their earnings. This would tend to increase the supply of labour and potentially raise employment levels, which contradicts the second condition of the question.\n\n**C:** An increase in subsidies for producers of merit goods lowers their costs of production. This encourages them to expand their output. To produce more, firms would need to hire more factors of production, including labour. Therefore, this policy would lead to an increase in the demand for labour and a higher level of employment, not a reduction. While it might indirectly reduce inequality by lowering the prices of goods consumed by the poor, it fails to meet the condition of reducing employment.\n\n**D:** The government providing more essential goods (e.g., public housing, healthcare) increases government spending and overall aggregate demand in the economy. To meet this new provision, the government or private contractors would need to hire more workers, leading to an increase in the level of employment.

The primary reason for this under-consumption is **information failure**. Consumers may not possess, or may not fully appreciate, all the information about the long-term private benefits of consuming the good. For example, an individual might undervalue the future career prospects gained from higher education or the long-term health benefits of regular exercise and a balanced diet. Because the perceived private benefit is lower than the actual private benefit, demand is lower than the socially optimal level, leading to under-consumption.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect. Merit goods, such as education and healthcare, are highly productive.

A progressive tax system is one where the proportion of income paid in tax rises as income rises. This combination of policies achieves this objective through two distinct but complementary changes:\n\n1.  **A higher top rate of income tax:** The existing income tax is already progressive. Increasing the top rate (the 40% rate on income over $30,000) makes it even more so. This change exclusively affects high-income earners, increasing their tax liability and reducing their post-tax (disposable) income. This directly narrows the gap between the highest and lowest earners in the country.\n\n2.  **A lower rate of sales tax:** Sales tax is a form of indirect, regressive taxation. It is regressive because lower-income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on goods and services than higher-income households. Consequently, the sales tax represents a larger percentage of a poor person's income. Lowering the rate of sales tax (e.g., from 10% to 5%) reduces this regressive effect. It provides a proportionally larger benefit to lower-income households, increasing their relative disposable income and thus contributing to a more equal income distribution.\n\nSince both proposed changes work in the same direction\u2014making the tax system more progressive\u2014this combination is the most likely to create a more equal distribution of income.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: a higher tax-free allowance and a higher rate of [sales] tax**\n\nThis combination has conflicting effects on income equality. A higher tax-free allowance is a progressive measure, as it reduces the tax burden most significantly for those on lower incomes. However, a higher rate of sales tax is a regressive measure. It would increase the tax burden disproportionately on lower-income households, as they spend a larger fraction of their income. The regressive impact of the higher sales tax could offset or even outweigh the progressive impact of the increased tax-free allowance, making it unlikely to be the most effective combination for creating more equality.\n\n**C: a lower tax-free allowance and a higher number of exempt goods**\n\nThis combination also has conflicting effects. Lowering the tax-free allowance is a regressive change. It would increase the taxable income for all taxpayers, but the impact would be felt most heavily by those on lower incomes, thus increasing income inequality. Conversely, increasing the number of goods exempt from sales tax (especially if these are necessities like food and clothing) would make the sales tax less regressive, benefiting lower-income households more. Given the opposing nature of these policies, it is not the most likely combination to create a more equal distribution of income.\n\n**D: a lower top rate of tax and a lower number of exempt goods**\n\nThis combination would almost certainly lead to a *less* equal distribution of income. Lowering the top rate of income tax is a regressive change, as it provides a tax cut exclusively to high-income earners, thereby widening the gap in disposable income. Similarly, reducing the number of goods exempt from sales tax would make the tax more regressive, as it would likely apply the tax to essential items that constitute a large part of the budget for low-income households.

The economy was in recession at the end of the first six months of 2021.**\n\nA recession is defined as a period of significant economic decline, technically marked by at least two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth. The data shows that the index of real GDP fell from 99.4 in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021 to 99.3 in the second quarter (Q2). This decrease, although small, represents a period of negative economic growth between these two quarters. The \"end of the first six months\" corresponds to the end of Q2. The fall in real GDP during Q2 indicates that the economy was contracting, which is the defining characteristic of a recessionary period. While the data does not show the preceding quarter (Q4 2020) to confirm a technical recession over two full quarters, the observed fall from Q1 to Q2 is direct evidence of economic contraction, making this the most valid conclusion among the choices.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Inflation reduced the real value of GDP in the first six months of 2021.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the table provides figures for **real** GDP. Real GDP is a measure of economic output that has been adjusted to remove the effects of price changes (inflation or deflation). Therefore, the changes in the index numbers reflect changes in the actual volume of goods and services produced, not changes in their monetary value due to inflation. Any impact of inflation has already been accounted for in the calculation of these real GDP figures.\n\n**B. Real GDP was lower at the end of 2021 than 2020.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The base year is 2020, for which the index of real GDP is 100. The \"end of 2021\" corresponds to the fourth quarter (Q4). The table shows that the index for Q4 2021 was 100.4. Since 100.4 is greater than 100, real GDP was actually 0.4% higher at the end of 2021 compared to the average level in 2020.\n\n**D. The standard of living was higher at the end of 2021 than in 2020.**\n\nThis conclusion cannot be drawn from the data provided. The standard of living is most commonly measured by real GDP per capita, which is calculated by dividing total real GDP by the population. The table shows that total real GDP was higher at the end of 2021 than in 2020 (index of 100.4 vs 100). However, the table provides no information about the country's population. If the population grew at a faster rate than real GDP (i.e., by more than 0.4%), then real GDP per capita, and consequently the standard of living, would have fallen. Without population data, no firm conclusion can be made about the standard of living."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_46.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "16 what is least likely to cause a simultaneous increase in demand-pull and cost-push inflation?\na_ depreciation of currency\nb increased import tariffs\nc_ decreased spending on infrastructure\nd_ increased wages", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA decrease in spending on infrastructure is a reduction in government expenditure (G), which is a component of aggregate demand (AD).

Exports represent expenditure by foreign individuals, firms, or governments on goods and services produced domestically. This inflow of foreign currency directly increases the revenue of domestic exporting firms. This revenue is then distributed within the economy as income to households in the form of wages for labour, rent for land, interest for capital, and profits for enterprise. As this income is a component of national income, an increase in exports leads to an immediate increase in the aggregate level of national income.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. imports would increase**\nImports are a withdrawal or leakage from the circular flow of income, as they represent domestic spending on foreign-produced goods and services. While an increase in imports may occur as a secondary effect, it is not the immediate result of an increase in exports. An increase in exports first raises national income. As national income rises, households and firms have more disposable income to spend, and a portion of this increased spending will be on imported goods. Therefore, an increase in imports is a consequence of the rise in national income, not the initial event.\n\n**C. savings would increase**\nSavings are also a withdrawal from the circular flow of income. An increase in savings is a consequence of an increase in national income, not its immediate cause. When households receive higher incomes (as a result of the export boom), they are likely to save a portion of that additional income, according to their marginal propensity to save. This increase in savings happens only after national income has risen.\n\n**D. taxes would increase**\nTaxes represent a withdrawal from the circular flow of income. Similar to savings and imports, an increase in tax revenue is an induced effect that follows a rise in national income. As the income of individuals and the profits of firms increase due to higher exports, the government's tax receipts from income taxes and corporation taxes will subsequently rise. This is a result of the growth in the tax base, which occurs after the initial increase in national income."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_48.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "18 tocalculate the unemployment rate, the number unemployed is related to\na the total adult population aged 18-65.\nb_ the number of unemployed who are seeking work.\nc the total number in full-time employment.\nd _ the total population in the labour force.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe unemployment rate is a key macroeconomic indicator calculated as the percentage of the labour force that is without a job but is actively seeking employment.

These are people who are economically inactive, such as full-time students, retirees, homemakers, and those unable to work due to long-term illness or disability. Relating the number of unemployed to the total adult population would produce the 'unemployment ratio', not the unemployment rate. This figure would be significantly lower and would not accurately reflect the health of the labour market, as it includes a large number of people who are not seeking work.\n\n**B:** The phrase \"unemployed who are seeking work\" is a definition of the numerator in the unemployment rate calculation, not the denominator. To be officially classified as unemployed, an individual must be without a job, available for work, and actively seeking employment. Relating the number of unemployed to itself does not create a rate or percentage; it simply restates the group being measured.\n\n**C:** The denominator for the unemployment rate must include all participants in the labour force, which consists of both the employed and the unemployed.

This spending represents a leakage or withdrawal from the circular flow of income, as the money flows out of the domestic economy to foreign producers. Since aggregate demand measures the demand for *domestically* produced goods and services, expenditure on imports is subtracted from the calculation.

The starting point is a balanced budget, where initial government spending (G) is equal to initial government revenue (T).\n\n1.  **Initial State:** G = T (Balanced Budget)\n2.  **Change in Spending:** The government increases its spending by 10%. The new level of spending (G') is G' = G \u00d7 (1 + 0.10) = 1.10 G.\n3.  **Condition for Surplus:** To achieve a budget surplus, the new government revenue (T') must be greater than the new government spending (G'). Therefore, T' > G' or T' > 1.10 G.\n4.  **Analysis:** Since the initial budget was balanced (G = T), the condition for a surplus can be written as T' > 1.10 T. This means the percentage increase in revenue must be greater than the 10% increase in spending.\n5.  **Evaluating the Option:** An increase in government revenue of 20% results in a new revenue level of T' = T \u00d7 (1 + 0.20) = 1.20 T. Since 1.20 T is greater than 1.10 T (the new spending level, relative to initial revenue), a budget surplus is created.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: -10%**\n\nThis option represents a 10% decrease in government revenue. The new revenue would be 90% of the original level (T' = 0.90 T). With new spending at 110% of the original level (G' = 1.10 G), spending would be significantly higher than revenue. This would result in a large budget deficit (where spending exceeds revenue), not a surplus.\n\n**B: 0%**\n\nThis option represents no change in government revenue (T' = T). Since government spending has increased by 10% (G' = 1.10 G), the new spending level would be greater than the unchanged revenue level. This situation would lead to a budget deficit, not a surplus.\n\n**C: +10%**\n\nAn increase in government revenue of 10% (T' = 1.10 T) would exactly match the 10% increase in government spending (G' = 1.10 G).

This policy is effective in addressing both high unemployment and a current account deficit simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Impact on the Current Account Deficit:** Depreciation makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and its imports more expensive for domestic consumers. According to the Marshall-Lerner condition, if the sum of the price elasticities of demand for exports and imports is greater than one, this change in relative prices will lead to an increase in the total value of exports and a decrease in the total value of imports. This improvement in the net export balance (X-M) directly reduces the current account deficit.\n\n2.  **Impact on Unemployment:** Net exports (X-M) are a component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)). As net exports rise following a depreciation, aggregate demand increases. This rise in AD stimulates economic activity, leading to higher real output and an increased demand for labour, thereby reducing cyclical unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) decrease government spending**\nThis is a contractionary fiscal policy. A reduction in government spending (G) directly decreases aggregate demand (AD). While a fall in AD and the resulting lower national income would reduce demand for imports and thus help to reduce the current account deficit (an expenditure-reducing effect), it would also lead to lower economic growth and an increase in unemployment. Therefore, this policy would worsen one of the economic problems it is intended to solve.\n\n**C) increase indirect taxation**\nAn increase in indirect taxes, such as a Value Added Tax (VAT), is a contractionary policy. It increases production costs for firms, shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left. It also reduces consumers' real disposable income, leading to a fall in consumption (C) and thus a decrease in aggregate demand (AD). This fall in AD would likely increase unemployment. While lower consumption and income might reduce spending on imports, thereby improving the current account deficit, the negative impact on employment makes this an inappropriate policy choice for achieving both objectives.\n\n**D) increase interest rates**\nThis is a contractionary monetary policy. Higher interest rates discourage both consumer spending (C) and business investment (I) by increasing the cost of borrowing. This leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, which would cause unemployment to rise. While the fall in AD could reduce import spending, higher interest rates also tend to attract foreign financial investment (\"hot money\"), increasing demand for the currency and causing it to appreciate. A currency appreciation would worsen the current account deficit by making exports more expensive and imports cheaper.

An increase in income tax reduces the disposable income of households, leading to a fall in consumption (C), which is a major component of AD. Simultaneously, an increase in sales tax raises the prices of goods and services, which reduces the purchasing power of consumers and further discourages consumption. Since both tax increases lead to a reduction in consumption, their combined effect is a significant decrease in aggregate demand at every price level, causing the AD curve to shift to the left from AD\u2081 to AD\u2082.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **A: decrease in income tax, decrease in sales tax**\n    This combination would cause an increase in aggregate demand. A decrease in income tax boosts households' disposable income, encouraging more consumption. A decrease in sales tax makes goods and services cheaper, also stimulating consumption.

A decrease in income tax would tend to increase AD by raising disposable income and consumption. Conversely, an increase in sales tax would tend to decrease AD by making goods more expensive and reducing consumption. The net effect on the AD curve is uncertain and depends on the relative magnitudes of the tax changes and consumer responsiveness. It is not the most likely cause of a definite leftward shift.\n\n*   **C: increase in income tax, decrease in sales tax**\n    Similar to option B, these policies have conflicting effects.

An increase in government expenditure on training directly targets the quality of the labour force. By improving the skills, knowledge, and efficiency of workers (i.e., increasing human capital), this policy enhances labour productivity. Higher productivity means that more output can be produced with the same amount of resources, leading to an expansion of the economy's potential output. This is a classic example of an interventionist supply-side policy aimed at achieving long-term economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B. an increase in sales tax**\nAn increase in sales tax is an indirect tax levied on goods and services, which raises the costs of production for firms. Higher production costs lead to a decrease in the quantity of goods and services firms are willing to supply at any given price level. This would cause a leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve, representing a contraction, not an expansion, of supply. This policy does not improve the economy's long-run productive potential.\n\n**C. an increase in the rate of interest**\nAn increase in the rate of interest is a tool of contractionary monetary policy, designed to reduce aggregate demand to control inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for firms, which discourages investment in new capital, technology, and infrastructure. A reduction in investment slows the growth of the economy's capital stock, which can hinder the expansion of long-run aggregate supply. Therefore, it is the opposite of an expansionary supply-side policy.\n\n**D. an increase of the exchange rate**\nAn increase (or appreciation) of the exchange rate makes a country's currency stronger relative to others. While this can lower the cost of imported raw materials and capital goods, potentially benefiting supply, its primary and more significant impact is on aggregate demand. A stronger currency makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers and imports cheaper for domestic consumers, which tends to reduce net exports (X-M) and decrease aggregate demand. It is not considered a primary tool for expanding the economy's long-run productive capacity and is more closely associated with demand-side management."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_54.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 the table indicates the factor inputs required to produce wheat and cars in countries x and y.\ninputs to produce inputs to produce\none tonne of wheat one car\ncountry x 4 2\ncountry y 8 6\nwhat makes it possible for both countries to benefit from trade?\na country x has an absolute advantage in wheat and car production.\nb_- country y has an absolute advantage in wheat and car production.\nc country y has a comparative advantage in wheat production.\nd opportunity cost of wheat and car production is the same between countries.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe basis for mutually beneficial international trade is the principle of comparative advantage. A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it can do so at a lower opportunity cost than another country.\n\nTo determine the comparative advantage, we must first calculate the opportunity cost for each country. The table provides input requirements, so the opportunity cost is calculated by seeing what is given up to reallocate resources.\n\n*   **Country X's Opportunity Costs:**\n    *   To produce one tonne of wheat requires 4 units of factor inputs. These 4 units could have been used to produce `4 / 2 = 2` cars. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 1 tonne of wheat is 2 cars.\n    *   To produce one car requires 2 units of factor inputs. These 2 units could have been used to produce `2 / 4 = 0.5` tonnes of wheat. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 1 car is 0.5 tonnes of wheat.\n\n*   **Country Y's Opportunity Costs:**\n    *   To produce one tonne of wheat requires 8 units of factor inputs. These 8 units could have been used to produce `8 / 6 \u2248 1.33` cars. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 1 tonne of wheat is 1.33 cars.\n    *   To produce one car requires 6 units of factor inputs. These 6 units could have been used to produce `6 / 8 = 0.75` tonnes of wheat. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 1 car is 0.75 tonnes of wheat.\n\nComparing the opportunity costs for wheat production, Country Y gives up 1.33 cars while Country X gives up 2 cars. Since 1.33 < 2, Country Y has a lower opportunity cost in wheat production and thus holds the comparative advantage. It is this difference in opportunity costs that allows both countries to benefit from specializing and trading.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options\n\n**A: Country X has an absolute advantage in wheat and car production.**\nThis statement is factually correct but does not explain why trade is mutually beneficial. Absolute advantage exists when a country can produce a good using fewer factor inputs. Country X requires only 4 units of inputs for wheat (versus 8 for Y) and 2 units for cars (versus 6 for Y), so it has an absolute advantage in both. However, gains from trade are determined by comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. The principle of comparative advantage demonstrates that trade can be beneficial even when one nation has an absolute advantage in all goods.\n\n**B: Country Y has an absolute advantage in wheat and car production.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Absolute advantage means being able to produce a good with fewer inputs. Country Y requires more inputs than Country X to produce both wheat (8 > 4) and cars (6 > 2). Therefore, Country Y has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both goods.\n\n**D: Opportunity cost of wheat and car production is the same between countries.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As calculated above, the opportunity cost of producing one tonne of wheat is 2 cars for Country X and 1.33 cars for Country Y. The opportunity costs are different. If the opportunity costs were the same for both countries, there would be no comparative advantage and, consequently, no gains to be made from trade.

This change in relative prices should increase the quantity of exports sold and decrease the quantity of imports purchased, thereby improving the net trade balance (X-M). However, if the country's main trading partners have imposed high trade barriers, such as tariffs or quotas, this mechanism will be ineffective. For example, a quota places a strict physical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported. Even if the depreciation makes the country's exports much cheaper, trading partners will not be able to buy more than the quota allows. Similarly, high tariffs would increase the price of the exports in the foreign market, potentially offsetting the price advantage gained from the depreciation. Consequently, the volume of exports may not increase, and the current account deficit will persist.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. The country gains a competitive advantage from the depreciation.**\nThis statement describes the intended effect of a currency depreciation. By making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, the country's goods become more price-competitive on the international market. This competitive advantage is the very reason why a depreciation is expected to reduce a current account deficit. Therefore, this is a reason for the policy's success, not its failure.\n\n**B. The country has a surplus on its capital and financial accounts.**\nThe balance of payments must always balance to zero (or close to it, accounting for errors and omissions). This means that a deficit on the current account must be offset by a surplus on the capital and financial account. A capital and financial account surplus simply indicates how the current account deficit is being financed (e.g., through foreign investment or borrowing). This is a statement of an accounting identity and describes the initial situation, but it does not explain why a policy aimed at correcting the current account deficit would fail.\n\n**C. The price elasticities of demand for the country's exports and imports are greater than one.**\nThis scenario describes the ideal conditions for a depreciation policy to succeed, as outlined by the Marshall-Lerner condition. This condition states that for a depreciation to improve the current account, the sum of the price elasticity of demand for exports (PEDx) and imports (PEDm) must be greater than one (PEDx + PEDm > 1). If both elasticities are greater than one (i.e., demand is elastic), a fall in export prices will lead to a more than proportionate increase in export quantity, raising total export revenue. Simultaneously, a rise in import prices will lead to a more than proportionate fall in import quantity, lowering total import expenditure.

It is calculated using the formula:\n\n**Terms of Trade Index = (Index of Average Export Prices / Index of Average Import Prices) \u00d7 100**\n\nA change in the terms of trade occurs when this ratio changes. According to the formula, if the average price of exports (the numerator) rises while the average price of imports (the denominator) falls, the value of the ratio must increase. This signifies a definite change\u2014specifically, an improvement\u2014in the country's terms of trade. An improvement means that the country can now acquire more imported goods for a given volume of exported goods.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. when the volume of exports falls and the volume of imports rises**\n\nThis is incorrect because the terms of trade are determined by the *prices* of exports and imports, not their *volumes* (quantities). A change in the volume of goods traded affects the balance of trade but does not, by definition, change the price ratio that constitutes the terms of trade. It is possible for export and import prices to remain constant (and thus the terms of trade to be unchanged) while the volumes traded fluctuate.\n\n**B. when the total value of exports falls and the total value of imports rises**\n\nThis is incorrect because the total value of trade is a function of both price and volume (Value = Price \u00d7 Volume). A fall in the total value of exports could be caused by a fall in export prices, a fall in export volume, or a combination of both. Similarly, a rise in the total value of imports could be due to higher import prices or higher import volumes. Because changes in value are not solely dependent on price, a change in the total value of trade does not necessitate a change in the terms of trade. For example, the terms of trade could improve (export prices rise, import prices fall) while the balance of trade value worsens (export volume falls dramatically, import volume rises dramatically).\n\n**C. when the balance of trade in goods moves from deficit to surplus**\n\nThis is incorrect for similar reasons to option B. The balance of trade in goods is the difference between the total *value* of exports and the total *value* of imports. A shift from a deficit to a surplus means the value of exports has become greater than the value of imports. This change in value could be driven by changes in the volumes of goods traded, changes in their prices, or both. Since a change in the balance of trade does not isolate the effect of prices, it does not guarantee a change in the terms of trade. A country could achieve a trade surplus by significantly increasing its export volumes, even if its terms of trade have worsened (i.e., it is receiving lower prices for its exports)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_57.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 the table shows an extract from a country\u2019s balance of payments.\nexports imports\n$ billion $ billion\n\ntrade in goods 150 200\ntrade in services 70 50\nprimary (investment) income 120 100\nsecondary (transfer) income 15 20\nwhat is the current account balance?\na -$10bn b  -$15bn c -$30bn d -$50bn", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe current account balance is calculated by summing the net balances of four key components: trade in goods, trade in services, primary income, and secondary income.

This tax increases the cost of bringing imported computers into the country. As a result, the price at which importers are willing to sell in the domestic market rises. This reduction in the supply of imports at any given price level causes the total supply curve, which is the sum of domestic supply and imported supply (`S_dom + imp`), to shift to the left. The diagram illustrates this shift from `S_dom + imp` to the new supply curve `S_2`. The new market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (`D`) and the new, reduced supply curve (`S_2`), resulting in a higher price (`p2`) and a lower quantity traded (`q2`).\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) an embargo on imports**\nAn embargo is a complete ban on the importation of a good. If the government imposed an embargo on computers, imports would fall to zero. The total supply in the market would then be equal to the domestic supply only (`S_dom`). The resulting equilibrium price would be determined by the intersection of the domestic supply curve (`S_dom`) and the demand curve (`D`). In the diagram, this intersection occurs at a price significantly higher than `p2`. The supply curve `S_2` lies to the right of `S_dom`, indicating that some imports are still available, which would not be the case under an embargo.\n\n**B) an exchange rate appreciation**\nAn appreciation of the domestic currency means that its value has increased relative to foreign currencies. This makes imported goods cheaper for domestic consumers, as less domestic currency is needed to buy the same amount of foreign goods. Cheaper imports would increase the quantity of imports at any given price, shifting the total supply curve (`S_dom + imp`) to the right. A rightward shift in supply would lead to a lower equilibrium price, not a higher price like `p2`.\n\n**C) a subsidy to domestic producers**\nA subsidy is a payment from the government to domestic firms, which lowers their costs of production. This would incentivize domestic producers to increase their output at every price level, causing the domestic supply curve (`S_dom`) to shift to the right. Consequently, the total supply curve (`S_dom + imp`) would also shift to the right. A rightward shift in the total supply curve would result in a lower market price, which is the opposite of the price increase from `p1` to `p2` shown in the diagram."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_60.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 what is not a likely cause of a deficit in the current account of the balance of payments?\na consumer spending is low.\nb_ primary incomes in the form of investment income are low.\nc_ the rate of exchange is high.\nd_ wage costs of production are high.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nLow consumer spending is **not** a likely cause of a current account deficit. In fact, it is more likely to reduce a deficit or create a surplus. A significant portion of consumer expenditure is on imported goods and services. When overall consumer spending in an economy is low, the demand for imports tends to fall. Since imports are a debit item (an outflow of money) on the current account, a reduction in imports improves the current account balance. Therefore, low consumer spending would contribute to a smaller deficit or a larger surplus, not cause a deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Primary incomes in the form of investment income are low.**\nThis is a likely cause of a current account deficit. The current account includes the balance of primary income, which records inflows of profits, dividends, and interest from assets held overseas (credits) and outflows to foreign owners of domestic assets (debits). If the income received from overseas investments is low, the value of credits on the primary income account decreases. All other factors remaining constant, this reduction in inflows will worsen the overall current account balance, contributing to a deficit.\n\n**C. The rate of exchange is high.**\nA high exchange rate is a very likely cause of a current account deficit. When a country's currency appreciates or is overvalued, its exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded for exports and thus a fall in export revenue (a credit). Simultaneously, imports become cheaper for domestic consumers and firms, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded for imports and a rise in import expenditure (a debit). The combination of falling credits and rising debits will cause the current account balance to worsen, leading to or increasing a deficit.\n\n**D. Wage costs of production are high.**\nHigh wage costs of production are a likely cause of a current account deficit. If a country's wage costs are high relative to its trading partners, its domestic firms face higher production costs. This can lead to higher prices for its goods and services, making them less competitive in international markets. As a result, demand for the country's exports is likely to fall, reducing export revenue (a credit). At the same time, imported goods become relatively cheaper compared to domestically produced goods, leading to a rise in import expenditure (a debit). This decline in international competitiveness worsens the trade balance and contributes to a current account deficit."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_61.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "1. which factor of production is needed first in order to set up a new business?\na capital\nb_ enterprise\nc_ labour\nd land", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Enterprise** is the factor of production that organises the other three factors\u2014land, labour, and capital\u2014into a productive unit. It involves having the initial idea for a business, taking the risks associated with starting a new venture, and making the key decisions to get it started. Before any land is acquired, any workers are hired, or any capital is purchased, an entrepreneur must first conceive of the business and decide to bring the other factors together. Therefore, enterprise is the initiating factor and is needed first.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: capital**\nCapital refers to the man-made resources used in production, such as machinery, tools, and buildings. While essential for operating a business, capital is not the first factor needed. The decision to acquire specific capital, the funds to purchase it, and the plan for its use are all organised by the entrepreneur. Enterprise must exist first to identify the need for capital and to arrange for its provision.\n\n**C: labour**\nLabour is the human effort, both mental and physical, applied in the production process. A business cannot be set up without an entrepreneur (enterprise) first creating the business concept and the organisational structure. Only after the business idea is established does the need to hire labour arise. Therefore, the factor of enterprise precedes the employment of labour.\n\n**D: land**\nLand encompasses all natural resources, including the physical site of the business. Similar to capital and labour, land is a passive factor of production that must be organised and put to use. An entrepreneur must first have a business plan to determine what kind of land or natural resources are required and then take action to acquire them.

A shift of the PPC to the left, also known as an inward shift, signifies a decrease in the economy's productive capacity. This is caused by a reduction in the quantity or quality of the factors of production.\n\nAn increase in the school leaving age requires young people to remain in full-time education for a longer period. This delays their entry into the labour force, thereby reducing the total number of available workers in the economy at any given time.

This intervention can take the form of setting price ceilings (maximum prices) on essential goods like food or rent, or establishing price floors (minimum prices) such as a national minimum wage for labour. Therefore, the statement that the government has **no role** in setting prices is incorrect and is not a characteristic of a mixed economy. This absence of government price-setting is a feature of a pure free-market economy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. The government manages taxation rights.**\nThis is a fundamental characteristic of a mixed economy. The government levies taxes on individuals and firms to raise revenue.

Taxation is a key tool of government fiscal policy to manage the economy.\n\n**C. The government prevents firms from earning excessive profits.**\nIn a mixed economy, the government seeks to correct market failures, one of which is the abuse of monopoly power.

Governments intervene through competition policy, price capping on utilities, or imposing windfall taxes to limit these profits and protect consumer interests.\n\n**D. The government provides services not provided by the private sector.**\nThis is a core function of the government in a mixed economy. The government provides public goods, such as national defence and street lighting, which the private sector would not supply due to the free-rider problem.

The division of labour involves breaking down a production process into a series of small, repetitive tasks, with each worker specialising in just one. While this can increase efficiency, it often leads to monotony and boredom for workers. They may feel alienated from the final product and lack a sense of accomplishment, which typically results in a *decrease*, not an increase, in motivation and job satisfaction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a decrease in average costs**\nThis is a likely result of the division of labour. Specialisation increases a worker's proficiency and speed, leading to a rise in output per worker (productivity). As more units are produced with the same or fewer resources, the cost per unit of output (average cost) falls. This is a primary reason firms implement the division of labour.\n\n**C: an increase in productivity**\nThis is a primary and direct outcome of the division of labour. By concentrating on a single task, workers become highly skilled and efficient through repetition. Less time is wasted switching between different tasks and tools. This enhanced skill and time-saving directly leads to an increase in productivity, measured as output per unit of labour per unit of time.\n\n**D: an improvement in quality of the final product**\nThis is a likely result of the division of labour.

A fall in the price of a good reduces the potential revenue and profit for producers. This acts as a disincentive, discouraging production. For firms that are less efficient or have higher costs, the new lower price may make production unprofitable, persuading them to exit the market and reallocate their resources elsewhere. This statement perfectly illustrates how a price change creates an incentive that directly influences the choices and actions of producers.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **A:** This statement describes the **signalling function** of price, not the incentive function. A price fall acts as a signal to consumers and producers, conveying information about market conditions. In this case, it signals that the good might be less scarce or in lower demand. While this information may influence a consumer's decision, the statement itself focuses on the communication of information rather than the motivation to act, which is the core of the incentive function.\n\n*   **C:** This statement illustrates the **rationing function** of price. When a price rises, it allocates a scarce good to only those consumers who are willing and able to pay the higher price. It effectively rations the good by pricing some consumers out of the market, as they can no longer afford it. This is distinct from the incentive function, which would focus on how the higher price motivates consumers to reduce their quantity demanded or switch to cheaper substitutes.\n\n*   **D:** This statement makes an economically questionable claim. A price rise does not inherently reduce competitiveness. In a competitive market, a sustained price rise, which signals higher profitability, typically acts as an incentive for new firms to enter the market.

Therefore, the conclusion that there is no shortage of oil in Russia can be directly derived from the data presented.\n\n***\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. In Britain, oil has zero opportunity cost.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the next-best alternative forgone when making a choice. The resources (land, labour, capital) used to produce oil in Britain could have been used to produce other goods or services. Therefore, the production of oil, like any economic activity, inherently involves an opportunity cost. The diagram shows that Britain does produce oil, so these resources have been allocated away from other potential uses.\n\n**B. In Japan, there is self-sufficiency in oil.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Self-sufficiency implies that a country's domestic production is at least equal to its domestic consumption. The diagram clearly shows that Japan's consumption of oil (approximately 0.25 billion tonnes) is significantly higher than its domestic production, which is nearly zero. This indicates that Japan is heavily dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and is not self-sufficient.\n\n**D. In the United States, rationing is the only solution to oil shortage.**\nThis statement cannot be concluded from the diagram. While the diagram shows that the United States has an oil shortage (consumption is greater than production), it provides no information about the policy solutions available or implemented. Rationing is one method to manage a shortage, but it is not the only one. Other potential solutions include increasing imports, implementing conservation policies, investing in alternative energy sources, or using the price mechanism to balance supply and demand. The diagram offers no basis for concluding that rationing is the *only* possible solution."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_68.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 the cross elasticity of demand between bus travel and rail travel is +2. a rise in the price of bus\nfares caused the demand for rail travel to rise by 10%.\nwhich change in bus fares would have caused this?\nfrom to\n(cents) (cents)\na 20 21\nb 30 33\ncc 40 45\nd 50 60", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe concept of Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for one good to a change in the price of another good.

The total change is known as the price effect.\n\nFor a **normal good**, a fall in price will *certainly* lead to an increase in the quantity demanded. This is because both the substitution and income effects work in the same direction to increase consumption.\n1.  **Substitution Effect:** A fall in price makes the good relatively cheaper compared to its substitutes. Consumers will therefore substitute away from other goods and buy more of this good. This effect always increases the quantity demanded of a good whose price has fallen.\n2.  **Income Effect:** A fall in price increases the consumer's real income or purchasing power. For a normal good, an increase in real income leads to an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nSince both effects are positive (i.e., they both lead to an increase in quantity demanded), their combined impact is a definite and certain increase in the quantity of the good demanded.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. Inferior good, price fall:**\nFor an inferior good, the substitution and income effects of a price fall work in opposite directions. The substitution effect leads to an increase in quantity demanded (as the good is now relatively cheaper), but the income effect leads to a decrease in quantity demanded (as higher real income causes consumers to buy less of an inferior good). The net outcome depends on the relative strength of these two effects. If the substitution effect is stronger, quantity demanded will rise. However, if the negative income effect is stronger (the case of a Giffen good), quantity demanded will fall. Therefore, an increase in quantity demanded is not certain.\n\n**B. Inferior good, price rise:**\nFor an inferior good, a price rise causes the quantity demanded to decrease due to the substitution effect (the good is now relatively more expensive). However, the income effect is positive; the fall in real income causes consumers to buy more of the inferior good. As the two effects are in opposition, the final outcome is ambiguous. While it is theoretically possible for quantity demanded to increase (if the good is a Giffen good), the most common outcome is a decrease. Thus, an increase is not a certain result.\n\n**D. Normal good, price rise:**\nFor a normal good, a rise in price will certainly lead to a *decrease* in the quantity demanded. The substitution effect is negative (the good is relatively more expensive, so consumers buy less), and the income effect is also negative (the consumer's real income falls, and for a normal good, this leads to buying less).

For a specific point on a supply curve, the formula is PES = (dQ/dP) \u00d7 (P/Q).\n\nFor any straight-line (linear) supply curve, the term (dQ/dP), which is the reciprocal of the slope of the curve, is constant at all points. Therefore, the value of PES along the curve depends entirely on the ratio of price to quantity (P/Q).\n\nAs we move up along the supply curve shown, both price (P) and quantity (Q) increase. However, the proportional increase in price is greater than the proportional increase in quantity. This means the ratio (P/Q) increases as we move to higher prices and quantities. Since PES is the product of a constant term (dQ/dP) and an increasing ratio (P/Q), the value of PES must rise as quantity supplied (and price) rises.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: PES is greater than unity at all points along the supply curve.**\nThis is incorrect. A linear supply curve is only elastic (PES > 1) at all points if it intercepts the vertical (price) axis. The supply curve shown in the diagram intercepts the horizontal (quantity) axis. Geometrically, any linear supply curve that starts from the quantity axis is inelastic (PES < 1) at all points along the curve. This is because the percentage change in quantity supplied will always be less than the percentage change in price.\n\n**B: PES is the same at all points along the supply curve.**\nThis is incorrect. For PES to be constant along a linear supply curve, the curve must pass through the origin (0,0). In that specific case, the ratio (P/Q) is constant and equal to the slope, making PES equal to 1 at all points. Since the given supply curve does not start at the origin, the ratio (P/Q) changes at every point, causing the PES to change as well.\n\n**C: PES is elastic when the price is low and becomes more inelastic when the price rises.**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as established, the supply curve is inelastic (PES < 1) at all points, not elastic (PES > 1). Secondly, as we move up the curve and the price rises, PES increases (it becomes less inelastic, moving closer to 1), it does not become more inelastic (moving closer to 0)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_72.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "12 the diagram shows the market for electric cars with x as the initial equilibrium.\nwhat will be the new equilibrium when the price of electric car batteries falls and consumers\nbecome more environmentally aware?\nd, d d,\nprice\n$ e ss,\nlif\n1 c s,\no electric cars", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nA fall in the price of electric car batteries reduces the cost of production for manufacturers.

Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity of a product demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers at a given price. A disequilibrium occurs when these two quantities are not equal.\n\nIf there is a decrease in demand for a product (a leftward shift of the demand curve), while the price initially remains at the original equilibrium level, the quantity demanded will fall. However, producers will still be supplying the original quantity. This creates a situation where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a surplus (or excess supply). This surplus is a state of market disequilibrium, accurately described as \"some producers being unable to sell products at the current price.\"\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. when a decrease in the demand for a product leads to a price fall that results in some producers leaving the market**\n\nThis option describes the market's adjustment process *from* an initial disequilibrium *to* a new equilibrium. A decrease in demand creates a surplus (disequilibrium). In response, the price falls. This price fall is the market mechanism working to restore balance. In the long run, the lower price might cause some less efficient producers to exit the market. The final outcome is a new, stable equilibrium at a lower price and quantity. The statement describes the entire adjustment process to a new equilibrium, not the state of disequilibrium itself.\n\n**C. when a decrease in the supply of a product leads to a price rise that results in the market for the product clearing**\n\nThis option describes the restoration of equilibrium, not the creation of disequilibrium. A decrease in supply initially causes a shortage (a type of disequilibrium) at the existing price. The market mechanism responds to this shortage with a price rise. The term \"market clearing\" specifically means that the price has adjusted to a new level where quantity demanded once again equals quantity supplied. This is the definition of a new market equilibrium.\n\n**D. when a decrease in the supply of a product leads to a price rise that makes it too expensive for some poorer households**\n\nThis statement describes a consequence of the market moving to a new equilibrium, not the disequilibrium itself. A decrease in supply will lead to a higher equilibrium price. As the price rises to its new equilibrium level, the quantity demanded falls (a movement along the demand curve). This rationing function of the price mechanism means that some consumers, including those with lower incomes, will no longer be willing or able to purchase the product.

This means that the total revenue remains constant despite the change in price from P\u2081 to P\u2082.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand (PED) is related to changes in total revenue as follows:\n*   If a price change leads to no change in total revenue, demand is **unit elastic**.\n*   If a price decrease leads to an increase in total revenue, demand is **elastic**.\n*   If a price decrease leads to a decrease in total revenue, demand is **inelastic**.\n\nSince the total revenue is constant, the demand must be unit elastic.

This indicates that the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the percentage change in price.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: -0.5**\nA PED value of -0.5 indicates that demand is inelastic. For inelastic demand, the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price.

For good W, expenditure decreases as income rises, indicating it is an inferior good with a negative YED.

This inverse relationship between income and demand defines an inferior good, which has a negative YED.\n\n**C: W only**\nThis option is incorrect.

Merit goods, such as education or healthcare, generate positive externalities, meaning their social benefits exceed the private benefits to the consumer.\n\nThe combination of setting an effective maximum price and paying producers a subsidy is the most effective way to achieve this goal.\n\n1.  **Paying producers a subsidy:** A subsidy is a government payment to producers for each unit of a good they produce. This lowers their costs of production, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. A rightward shift in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity, thereby increasing consumption.\n2.  **Setting an effective maximum price:** An effective maximum price (a price ceiling) is set below the free-market equilibrium price. This makes the good more affordable for consumers, which increases the quantity demanded. By itself, a maximum price can lead to a shortage (excess demand) as producers may be unwilling to supply enough at the lower price.\n\nHowever, when combined, these two policies are highly effective. The maximum price ensures the good is affordable, stimulating demand. The subsidy simultaneously encourages producers to increase their output, ensuring that the higher quantity demanded at the maximum price can be met. This dual approach directly addresses both the affordability for consumers and the incentive for producers, leading to a significant increase in the quantity of the merit good consumed.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B: setting an effective maximum price on the product and imposing an indirect tax on producers**\n\nThis combination is counterproductive. While an effective maximum price aims to make the good cheaper for consumers, an indirect tax increases producers' costs. This shifts the supply curve to the left, leading to a higher market price and a lower quantity supplied. Forcing producers to accept a lower (maximum) price while also increasing their costs through a tax creates a strong disincentive to produce. This would likely lead to a severe shortage and a decrease, not an increase, in consumption.\n\n**C: setting an effective minimum price on the product and paying producers a subsidy**\n\nAn effective minimum price (a price floor) is set above the equilibrium price. This makes the product more expensive for consumers, which would cause the quantity demanded, and therefore consumption, to fall. While a subsidy would encourage producers to supply more, the high price set by the minimum price would still deter consumers. This combination would result in a large surplus (excess supply) and lower overall consumption.\n\n**D: setting an effective minimum price on the product and imposing an indirect tax on producers**\n\nThis combination is the most likely to *decrease* consumption. An effective minimum price raises the price for consumers, reducing the quantity demanded.

In this model, the vertical axis explicitly represents the **price level** (often measured by an index like the CPI or GDP deflator), and the horizontal axis represents **real national output** (Real GDP). The equilibrium in the economy is found at the intersection of the AD and AS curves. Any shift in either of these curves\u2014caused by changes in factors like government spending, consumer confidence, or input costs\u2014will result in a new equilibrium point. This new equilibrium directly indicates a new overall price level, which is read from the vertical axis. Therefore, a change in the price level is a direct outcome shown by the analysis.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: the nominal income level**\n\nThe AD/AS model does not directly show the nominal income level. The horizontal axis represents *real* income (or real output/Real GDP), which is income adjusted for changes in the price level. Nominal income is the product of the price level and real income (Nominal GDP = Price Level \u00d7 Real GDP). While one can calculate the change in nominal income using the values for the price level and real output from the graph, it is not a variable that is directly represented on either axis of the model.\n\n**C: the unemployment level**\n\nThe level of unemployment is not a variable shown on either axis of the AD/AS model. The model's horizontal axis shows the level of real output. While there is a strong inverse relationship between real output and unemployment (as output rises, firms typically hire more workers, reducing unemployment), this relationship is an inference made from the model's results. The unemployment rate itself is not directly measured or plotted within the standard AD/AS framework.\n\n**D: the wage level**\n\nThe wage level is a critical determinant of firms' costs of production and, as such, is a key factor that can shift the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. For instance, an economy-wide increase in nominal wages will increase production costs, causing the SRAS curve to shift to the left. However, the wage level is an underlying determinant (an exogenous variable) that influences the position of the curve; it is not one of the variables (endogenous variables) being determined by the model and shown on the axes. The axes represent the overall price level and real output, not the wage level."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_79.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 why might aggregate demand increase when a country\u2019s price level falls?\na_ domestic interest rates will tend to fall.\nb_ imports become more price competitive.\nc_ real incomes fall.\nd_ the purchasing power of savings falls.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA fall in the general price level leads to a decrease in the demand for money, as households and firms need less money to conduct their transactions. With a lower demand for money, households tend to save more or use their excess cash to purchase financial assets like bonds. This increases the supply of loanable funds in the financial system, which puts downward pressure on the nominal interest rate. A lower interest rate reduces the cost of borrowing for both firms and households, stimulating investment spending (e.g., on new machinery) and consumption spending (e.g., on cars and houses), both of which are key components of aggregate demand. This relationship is known as the interest-rate effect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Imports become more price competitive.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A fall in a country's domestic price level means that its goods and services become cheaper relative to goods and services produced in other countries. Consequently, domestic goods become *more* price competitive, while imports become relatively *less* price competitive. This change encourages domestic consumers to substitute domestic goods for imports and encourages foreign consumers to buy more of the country's exports. The resulting increase in net exports (exports minus imports) causes aggregate demand to rise. The option incorrectly states the effect on import competitiveness.\n\n**C. Real incomes fall.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Real income is nominal income adjusted for the price level (Real Income = Nominal Income / Price Level). When the price level falls, assuming nominal income remains constant, the purchasing power of that income increases. Therefore, real incomes *rise*, not fall. An increase in real income would lead to higher consumption and thus an increase in aggregate demand. A fall in real income would have the opposite effect, decreasing aggregate demand.\n\n**D. The purchasing power of savings falls.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The purchasing power of savings refers to the real value of financial assets with a fixed nominal value, such as money in a savings account. When the price level falls, each unit of currency can buy more goods and services. This means the real value, or purchasing power, of savings *increases*. This phenomenon, known as the wealth effect, makes people feel wealthier and encourages them to increase their consumption, which in turn increases aggregate demand. The option describes the opposite of what occurs."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_80.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is used to convert nominal gdp to real gdp?\na_ exchange rates\nb_ changes in the price level\nc interest rates\nd taxation", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nReal GDP is a measure of a country's economic output adjusted for the effects of inflation or deflation. Nominal GDP, on the other hand, is calculated using current market prices and is not adjusted for price level changes. Therefore, to convert nominal GDP to real GDP, one must account for any changes in the general price level that have occurred between the base year and the current year. This is typically done using a price index, such as the GDP deflator, which measures the overall change in prices for all goods and services produced in an economy. The formula is: Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / Price Index) \u00d7 100. This process removes the component of growth in nominal GDP that is due solely to rising prices, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the change in the actual volume of production.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: exchange rates**\nExchange rates represent the value of one country's currency in terms of another. They are used to compare economic data, such as GDP, between different countries by converting them into a common currency. However, exchange rates are not used to adjust for price level changes *within* a single country over time, which is the purpose of converting nominal GDP to real GDP.\n\n**C: interest rates**\nInterest rates are the cost of borrowing or the reward for saving. They are a key instrument of monetary policy and influence levels of consumption and investment, which are components of GDP. While changes in interest rates can affect the growth of both nominal and real GDP, they are not the statistical tool used to deflate nominal GDP to arrive at the real figure. The conversion is an accounting adjustment for inflation, not a reflection of the cost of capital.\n\n**D: taxation**\nTaxation is a tool of fiscal policy used by governments to raise revenue and influence aggregate demand. Changes in taxation can impact disposable income and corporate profits, thereby affecting consumption and investment, and consequently, the level of GDP. However, taxation is not the mechanism used to adjust nominal GDP for inflation. The calculation to find real GDP is a statistical procedure to isolate changes in output volume from changes in the price level."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_81.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "21 the diagram shows a basic two-sector circular flow of income.\nfactor market \u2014\n=] ee\np la product market _\u2014t\nwhat can be concluded about the direction of flows?\na consumer expenditure flows anticlockwise.\nb_ goods and services flow clockwise.\nc_ incomes flow anticlockwise.\nd_ resources flow anticlockwise.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nResources, also known as factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise), are owned by households.

This creates a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for available jobs. The proposed solution, introducing minimum wage legislation, does not address this skills mismatch. Minimum wage legislation sets a legal price floor for labour. By increasing the cost of labour, it may actually incentivize firms to substitute labour with capital (technology) at a faster rate, potentially worsening technological unemployment. An appropriate solution for technological unemployment would involve supply-side policies such as retraining and re-skilling workers to equip them for new roles created by technology or in other growing sectors of the economy. Therefore, the pairing of technological unemployment with the introduction of minimum wage legislation is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B: Cyclical unemployment and raise government spending**\nThis combination is correct. Cyclical (or demand-deficient) unemployment is caused by a lack of aggregate demand (AD) in the economy, typically during a recession. Raising government spending is a form of expansionary fiscal policy. As government spending is a component of AD (AD = C + I + G + X - M), an increase in G directly boosts total demand. This encourages firms to increase output, leading to a higher demand for labour and a reduction in cyclical unemployment.\n\n**C: Frictional unemployment and increase advertising of job vacancies**\nThis combination is correct. Frictional unemployment occurs when workers are in the process of moving between jobs. It is caused by imperfect information in the labour market, which means it takes time for job seekers to find suitable vacancies and for employers to find suitable candidates. Increasing the advertising of job vacancies through platforms like job websites and employment agencies improves the flow of information. This helps to match workers with jobs more quickly, reducing the duration of job searches and thereby lowering the level of frictional unemployment.\n\n**D: Structural unemployment and retrain workers**\nThis combination is correct. Structural unemployment is a long-term form of unemployment caused by a fundamental mismatch between the skills possessed by the workforce and the skills demanded by employers, often due to changes in the economy's structure (e.g., the decline of an industry). Retraining workers is a supply-side policy aimed directly at solving this problem. By providing education and vocational training, it helps unemployed individuals acquire the new skills that are in demand, enabling them to re-enter the workforce and fill available positions."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_83.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "23 which combination of policies would be most effective in reducing a balance of payments current\naccount surplus?\n\na decrease in a devaluation of the an expansionary\n\ntariffs on imports exchange rate monetary policy\na no yes no\nb no no yes\ncc yes no yes\nd yes yes no", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA balance of payments current account surplus occurs when a country's total exports of goods, services, and transfers exceed its total imports. To reduce this surplus, policies must either increase imports, decrease exports, or a combination of both.\n\n**Analysis of Policies:**\n\n1.  **A decrease in tariffs on imports:** Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, which raises their price for domestic consumers. A decrease in tariffs makes imported goods and services cheaper. This increases the demand for imports, leading to higher import expenditure. As the current account is calculated as Exports (X) - Imports (M), an increase in M will reduce the (X-M) surplus. Therefore, this is an effective policy.\n\n2.  **An expansionary monetary policy:** This policy aims to stimulate economic activity, typically by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. This boosts aggregate demand (AD), leading to higher national income. As incomes rise, consumers and firms spend more on all goods and services, including imports. The increase in import spending helps to reduce the current account surplus. Additionally, higher AD can lead to demand-pull inflation, making domestic goods less price-competitive, which may reduce exports and further increase imports, both actions contributing to a smaller surplus. Therefore, this is also an effective policy.\n\n3.  **A devaluation of the exchange rate:** Devaluation means officially lowering the value of a country's currency against other currencies. This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and makes imports more expensive for domestic buyers. The result, assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, is an increase in export revenue and a decrease in import expenditure. This would *increase* the current account surplus, not reduce it. Devaluation is a policy used to correct a current account deficit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective combination of policies to reduce a current account surplus would be those that work together to increase imports and/or decrease exports. A decrease in tariffs and an expansionary monetary policy both contribute to this goal by increasing imports. Devaluation would be counterproductive. Therefore, the correct combination includes a decrease in tariffs and an expansionary monetary policy but excludes devaluation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it includes the devaluation of the exchange rate. Devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which would widen the current account surplus, counteracting the objective.\n\n**B:** While an expansionary monetary policy would help reduce a surplus by increasing import demand, this option incorrectly excludes a decrease in tariffs. Decreasing tariffs is a direct and effective policy for increasing imports. A combination of both policies (as in option C) would be more effective than implementing only one.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it includes devaluation, which works to increase a current account surplus. Combining a decrease in tariffs (which increases imports) with a devaluation (which decreases imports) would result in conflicting and likely ineffective policy outcomes."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_84.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 if acountry is experiencing a period of high inflation, which groups will benefit the most from this?\ncompanies at fixed income those with\napart ihe: majority earners high debts\nof their output\na yes yes no\nb no yes yes\ncc yes no no\nd no no yes", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of Correct Answer\n\nDuring a period of high inflation, the general price level of goods and services in an economy rises, which erodes the purchasing power of money. The effects of this vary across different economic groups.\n\n*   **Companies that export the majority of their output** do not benefit from high domestic inflation. High inflation increases their domestic costs of production (such as wages and raw materials). This raises the price of their exports in foreign markets, making them less price-competitive. As a result, the quantity of exports demanded is likely to fall, leading to lower revenues and profits for these companies.\n\n*   **Fixed income earners** are negatively affected by high inflation. This group includes pensioners and individuals on fixed salaries. Their nominal income does not increase in line with rising prices, so the real value of their income\u2014their purchasing power\u2014declines. They can afford to buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money.\n\n*   **Those with high debts** (debtors) benefit from unanticipated high inflation. Inflation reduces the real value of the money they must repay. For example, if an individual has a loan with a fixed interest rate, the nominal value of their repayments stays the same, but this amount represents a smaller portion of their rising income and has less purchasing power. Essentially, they repay their debt with money that is worth less than the money they originally borrowed, reducing the real burden of their debt.\n\nTherefore, companies that export and fixed income earners are harmed by high inflation, while those with high debts benefit.\n\n### Explanations of Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **Why 'yes, yes, no' is incorrect:** This combination is incorrect because both exporting companies and fixed-income earners are harmed by high inflation, not benefited.

In reality, their fixed nominal income loses purchasing power as the cost of living increases, making them worse off.\n*   **Why 'yes, no, no' is incorrect:** This combination incorrectly suggests that exporting companies benefit from high inflation and that those with high debts do not.

The formula is:\n\n**Terms of Trade Index = (Index of Export Prices / Index of Import Prices) \u00d7 100**\n\nA change in the terms of trade occurs when this ratio changes. An increase in the ratio is called an improvement in the terms of trade, while a decrease is a deterioration.\n\n1.  **When the price of imported raw materials increases:** This directly increases the average price of imports (the denominator in the ToT formula). Assuming the price of exports remains constant, a rise in the import price index will cause the ToT ratio to fall. This represents a deterioration in the terms of trade. Therefore, this will definitely change a country's terms of trade.\n\n3.  **An appreciation of the exchange rate:** An appreciation means the value of a country's currency has risen relative to other currencies. This has two effects:\n    *   It lowers the price of imports in the domestic currency because less domestic currency is needed to buy the same foreign-priced goods.\n    *   It raises the price of exports in foreign currencies, but the price in the domestic currency (in which the ToT index is often calculated) remains unchanged.\n    As a result, the index of import prices falls while the index of export prices (in domestic currency) stays the same. This causes the ToT ratio to increase, signifying an improvement. Thus, an exchange rate appreciation will definitely change the terms of trade.\n\n### Why other options are incorrect\n\n2.  **A change in inflation rates:** Inflation is a general rise in the price level of an economy. While inflation will likely increase the price of domestically produced exports, it can also affect the price of imports. It is possible for both the export price index and the import price index to rise by the same proportion. If both the numerator and the denominator in the ToT formula increase by the same percentage, the ratio will remain unchanged. Therefore, a change in the inflation rate does not *definitely* change the terms of trade; only a change in the *relative* prices of exports and imports will do so.\n\nSince only statements 1 and 3 describe events that will definitely alter the ratio of export prices to import prices, option **C (1 and 3 only)** is the correct answer."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_86.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 the world consists of two countries, m and n. the graphs show their production possibilities for\nwheat and rice.\ncountry m country n\n100\nrice rice\n75\n0 0\n0 100 0 50\nwheat wheat\ncountries m and n operate on their production possibility curves and, before specialisation,\ncountry m produces 60 units of wheat and country n produces 30 units of wheat.\nwhat will be the change in the world output of rice if both countries decide to specialise\naccording to comparative advantage?\na it will fall by 5 units.\nb it will fall by 30 units.\nc_itwill rise by 5 units.\ndit will rise by 30 units.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe change in the world output of rice will be a rise of 5 units. This is determined by calculating the total world production of rice before and after specialisation based on the principle of comparative advantage.\n\n1.  **Determine Comparative Advantage:**\n    *   First, we must calculate the opportunity cost of producing each good for both countries.\n    *   **Country M:** To produce 100 units of wheat, it forgoes 100 units of rice. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of wheat is 1 unit of rice (100R/100W). The opportunity cost of 1 unit of rice is 1 unit of wheat (100W/100R).\n    *   **Country N:** To produce 50 units of wheat, it forgoes 75 units of rice. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of wheat is 1.5 units of rice (75R/50W). To produce 75 units of rice, it forgoes 50 units of wheat. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of rice is 2/3 (or approx. 0.67) of a unit of wheat (50W/75R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Country M has a lower opportunity cost in producing wheat (1 rice < 1.5 rice), so it has a comparative advantage in wheat. Country N has a lower opportunity cost in producing rice (0.67 wheat < 1 wheat), so it has a comparative advantage in rice.\n\n2.  **Calculate World Rice Output Before Specialisation:**\n    *   The production possibility curve (PPC) for country M can be represented by the equation: Rice + Wheat = 100. If M produces 60 units of wheat, it produces 100 - 60 = 40 units of rice.\n    *   The PPC for country N can be represented by the equation: Rice + 1.5 * Wheat = 75. If N produces 30 units of wheat, it produces 75 - (1.5 * 30) = 75 - 45 = 30 units of rice.\n    *   Total world rice output before specialisation = 40 (from M) + 30 (from N) = 70 units.\n\n3.  **Calculate World Rice Output After Specialisation:**\n    *   With specialisation, each country produces only the good in which it has a comparative advantage.\n    *   Country M specialises in wheat, producing 0 units of rice.\n    *   Country N specialises in rice, producing its maximum of 75 units of rice.\n    *   Total world rice output after specialisation = 0 (from M) + 75 (from N) = 75 units.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Change:**\n    *   Change in world rice output = Output after specialisation - Output before specialisation = 75 - 70 = +5 units.\n    *   Therefore, the world output of rice will rise by 5 units.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: It will fall by 5 units.\n\nThis is incorrect. Specialisation according to comparative advantage is expected to increase total world output, not decrease it. This result would be obtained by incorrectly calculating the change as 70 (before) - 75 (after) = -5. This reflects a misunderstanding of how to calculate the change in output or a miscalculation of the initial or final production levels.\n\n#### B: It will fall by 30 units.\n\nThis is incorrect. A fall in output would contradict the principle of gains from trade through specialisation. This figure could be reached through a significant calculation error, for instance, by correctly calculating Country N's initial rice production (30 units) but then incorrectly assuming that Country N stops producing rice after specialisation (output becomes 0), while Country M's production remains unchanged. This would result in a drop of 30 units (from 70 to 40), but it misinterprets which country should specialise in rice.\n\n#### D: It will rise by 30 units.\n\nThis is incorrect and results from misidentifying which country has the comparative advantage in each good. If one were to mistakenly conclude that Country M has the comparative advantage in rice and Country N in wheat, then Country M would specialise and produce 100 units of rice, while Country N would produce zero. The total world output of rice would be 100. Compared to the pre-specialisation output of 70 units, this would be a rise of 30 units (100 - 70).

A fall in the general price level, or a reduction in the rate at which it rises, is a fall in inflation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of a contractionary monetary policy is a fall in both investment and inflation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: a fall in investment and a rise in inflation\n\nThis option is incorrect because a fall in investment leads to a decrease, not an increase, in inflation. A fall in investment reduces aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the left. This reduces demand-pull inflationary pressures, causing the price level to fall or rise more slowly. A rise in inflation would typically be associated with an increase in aggregate demand (demand-pull inflation) or a decrease in aggregate supply (cost-push inflation), neither of which results from a contractionary monetary policy.\n\n#### C: a rise in investment and a fall in inflation\n\nThis option is incorrect because contractionary monetary policy causes investment to fall, not rise. The policy's primary mechanism is to raise interest rates, which increases the cost of borrowing and discourages firms from undertaking new investment projects. While a fall in inflation is a correct consequence of the policy, it is caused by a decrease in aggregate demand, which itself is partly caused by the fall in investment. A rise in investment would be associated with an *expansionary* monetary policy.\n\n#### D: a rise in investment and a rise in inflation\n\nThis option is incorrect as it describes the effects of an *expansionary* monetary policy, which is the opposite of the policy being implemented. An expansionary policy involves lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower interest rates would encourage borrowing, leading to a rise in investment. The resulting increase in aggregate demand would shift the AD curve to the right, causing a rise in the general price level (a rise in inflation)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_88.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 a government wishes to reduce the deficit on the secondary income section of its current\naccount.\nwhich policy would be most effective?\na_anincrease in subsidies to exporters\nb_anincrease in the tariffs on imports\nc_ areduction in the number of migrant workers allowed into the country\nd_ areduction in overseas aid donations", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe secondary income account (also known as current transfers) records one-way transfers of money between a country and the rest of the world where no goods or services are exchanged. A deficit on this account means that outflows are greater than inflows. These flows include items such as government contributions to international organisations, foreign aid, and remittances sent by workers.\n\nOverseas aid donations made by the government are a significant debit (outflow) on the secondary income account. Therefore, a reduction in the amount of aid given to other countries directly decreases the value of the outflows. This will, in turn, reduce the deficit on the secondary income account. As this is a direct policy action with a certain outcome on the account, it is considered the most effective policy among the choices.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. an increase in subsidies to exporters**\nThis policy is designed to make a country's exports cheaper and more competitive in international markets. An increase in exports would be recorded as a credit on the **trade in goods** section of the current account. While this would help to improve the overall current account balance, it does not directly affect the secondary income account.\n\n**B. an increase in the tariffs on imports**\nThis policy makes imported goods more expensive for domestic consumers, which is intended to reduce the quantity of imports. A reduction in imports would decrease the debits on the **trade in goods** section of the current account. Similar to subsidies for exporters, this policy affects the trade balance, not the secondary income account.\n\n**C. a reduction in the number of migrant workers allowed into the country**\nRemittances sent home by migrant workers are a debit (outflow) on the secondary income account. Reducing the number of migrant workers would likely lead to a decrease in these remittance outflows, which would help to reduce the secondary income deficit. However, this policy's effect is less direct and certain than reducing overseas aid. The government has direct control over its own aid budget, making a cut in aid a more direct and predictably effective policy for targeting the secondary income deficit specifically."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_89.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "29 supply-side policies can be used to correct cost-push inflation.\nwhich policy would best achieve this aim in the long run?\na allowing trade unions to maintain work practices irrespective of productivity\nb_ encouraging workers to work extra hours for extra pay\nc increasing total labour supply by employing more unskilled workers\nd supporting the replacement of labour-manned machines by the use of robots", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nSupporting the replacement of labour-manned machines with robots is a long-run supply-side policy that directly addresses cost-push inflation by increasing productivity and reducing long-term production costs. Automation through robotics represents a significant technological advancement and an increase in the capital stock. This leads to greater efficiency, meaning more output can be produced with fewer inputs (specifically, labour). As firms' long-run average costs decrease, the upward pressure on prices is alleviated. This policy increases the economy's potential output, shifting the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right, which results in a lower price level and higher real GDP, effectively correcting cost-push inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. allowing trade unions to maintain work practices irrespective of productivity**\nThis policy would likely worsen cost-push inflation rather than correct it. If trade unions enforce work practices that are inefficient or prevent the adoption of more productive methods, the cost per unit of output will rise. Firms face higher labour costs without a corresponding increase in output, which is a primary driver of cost-push inflation. Effective supply-side policies aim to increase labour market flexibility and productivity, whereas this policy does the opposite.\n\n**B. encouraging workers to work extra hours for extra pay**\nWhile this might increase total output in the short run, it is not an effective long-run solution for cost-push inflation. \"Extra pay\" for extra hours often implies paying overtime rates, which increases the marginal cost of labour for firms. This can contribute to, rather than solve, cost-push inflation. Furthermore, this policy does not fundamentally increase the economy's long-run productive capacity or efficiency (labour productivity); it simply utilizes the existing labour force more intensively in the short term.\n\n**C. increasing total labour supply by employing more unskilled workers**\nWhile increasing the labour supply is a type of supply-side policy, focusing on *unskilled* workers is not the most effective way to combat cost-push inflation. The key to reducing costs in the long run is to increase productivity (output per worker). Adding a large number of unskilled workers may increase total potential output, but it could lower average productivity, especially if not matched with sufficient capital and training.

It may be considered a club good (if it is still non-rivalrous) or a private good (if it becomes rivalrous due to congestion).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Flowers in parks are a public good because people can enjoy them at no charge.**\nThis statement is incorrect because being available 'at no charge' is a common outcome of a good being a public good, but it is not the defining characteristic. The reason public goods are often free is because of the non-excludability problem (it's difficult to charge people), which leads to the free-rider problem and necessitates non-market provision. The core definition relies on non-excludability and non-rivalry, not on the price being zero.\n\n**B. Flowers in parks are a public good because they are owned by local people and are not for profit.**\nThis is incorrect because the classification of a good as public or private depends on its consumption characteristics (excludability and rivalry), not on who owns it or whether it is provided for profit. A private firm could provide a public good (e.g., a fireworks display funded by a sponsor), and a government could provide a private good (e.g., electricity from a state-owned utility). Ownership and profit motive are irrelevant to the economic definition of a public good.\n\n**D. Flowers in parks are not a public good if they are individual, not identical, in nature.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The physical characteristics of the good, such as whether the flowers are unique or uniform, have no bearing on whether the good is public or private.

The opportunity cost is the value of the production that is sacrificed. While employees may gain more leisure time, this is a by-product of the loss of their employment and income. The primary alternative forgone by the economy is the productive output, not the leisure time of workers.\n\n**B. lives that are saved due to reduced disease levels**\nThis represents the intended **benefit** of the policy, not its cost.

This means that for every additional unit of one good produced, a constant amount of the other good must be given up. This occurs because the factors of production (such as labour and capital) are assumed to be perfectly substitutable between the production of goods and services. Their productivity does not change when they are reallocated from one industry to the other. In this context, the term \"constant returns\" is used to describe this constant trade-off.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B: diminishing returns to scale in the production of both goods and services:** This would be represented by a PPC that is bowed outwards (concave to the origin). A concave PPC illustrates the law of increasing opportunity cost, where resources are not perfectly substitutable. As an economy produces more of one good, it must reallocate resources that are less suited for its production, leading to progressively larger sacrifices of the other good. This is the typical shape of a real-world PPC.\n\n*   **C: increasing returns to scale in the production of both goods and services:** This would be represented by a PPC that is bowed inwards (convex to the origin). This shape indicates a decreasing opportunity cost, meaning that as production of one good increases, the amount of the other good that must be sacrificed becomes smaller. This is a theoretically possible but uncommon scenario, which might occur if there were significant specialisation benefits from concentrating production.\n\n*   **D: infinite returns to scale in the production of both goods and services:** This concept is incompatible with the PPC model.

New enterprises often require loans to finance start-up costs, such as purchasing equipment or premises. Lower borrowing costs make investment more affordable and attractive, thereby encouraging the formation of new businesses.\n*   **Low profit tax** increases the potential reward for entrepreneurs. The primary motive for starting a business is to earn a profit. When the government takes a smaller percentage of these profits in tax, the net return to the business owner is higher, strengthening the incentive to undertake the risks associated with a new venture.\n*   **High consumer confidence** indicates that households are optimistic about their future financial situation and the economy's health.

Demand is considered **price elastic** when a percentage change in price leads to a proportionally larger percentage change in the quantity demanded (i.e., the PED value is greater than 1).\n\nThis is most likely to occur when the product accounts for a large percentage of a consumer's income. When a good, such as a car or rent, represents a significant portion of a person's budget, even a small percentage increase in its price translates to a large absolute amount of money. This significant impact on the consumer's purchasing power makes them highly sensitive to price changes. Consequently, they are more likely to drastically reduce the quantity they demand, seek out alternatives, or postpone the purchase, resulting in price elastic demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) It is measured in the short run.**\nThis is incorrect. In the short run, consumers often have limited ability to change their consumption habits or find alternative products. For example, if the price of petrol increases, a person who relies on their car for commuting may not be able to immediately switch to public transport. Therefore, demand tends to be more price **inelastic** in the short run. Demand becomes more elastic in the long run as consumers have more time to adjust their behaviour and find substitutes.\n\n**C) It is a necessity product.**\nThis is incorrect. A necessity is a good or service that consumers deem essential, such as basic food, water, or medicine. Because these items are required for daily life, consumers will continue to purchase them in similar quantities even if the price rises. This low responsiveness of quantity demanded to a price change means that necessities typically have price **inelastic** demand.\n\n**D) There are few substitutes available.**\nThis is incorrect. The availability of close substitutes is a primary determinant of price elasticity. If a product has few or no substitutes, consumers have limited alternatives to turn to if its price increases. This lack of choice forces them to continue buying the product, making their demand less responsive to price changes. Therefore, a product with few available substitutes tends to have price **inelastic** demand.

The size of the industry, which refers to the number of firms or producers in the market, is a key determinant. If the number of rice producers increases (the industry expands), the total quantity of rice supplied at any given price will rise, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. Conversely, if producers exit the industry (it contracts), the total supply at any given price will fall, shifting the supply curve to the left.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** A change in the price of the rice itself causes a movement *along* the supply curve, not a *shift* of the curve. This is known as a change in the \"quantity supplied.\" The supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to sell. When only the price changes, producers adjust their output level along this existing relationship. A shift in the curve only occurs when an underlying condition of supply (other than the good's own price) changes.\n\n**B:** A change in the price of meat is a determinant of the *demand* for rice, not its supply. Meat and rice are often consumed together, making them complementary goods. If the price of meat changes, it will likely alter the quantity of rice consumers are willing to buy, causing a shift in the demand curve for rice. It does not directly affect the costs of production, technology, or number of producers in the rice industry, which are the factors that shift the supply curve.\n\n**D:** A change in tastes and preferences is a primary determinant of *demand*. If consumers develop a greater preference for rice, the demand for rice will increase, shifting the demand curve to the right.

Consumers are less willing and able to buy the product as it becomes more expensive. This is represented as a movement upwards along the demand curve.\n2.  **Quantity Supplied:** According to the law of supply, a higher price incentivises producers to offer more of the product for sale, as it is now more profitable to do so.

The demand curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price, holding all other factors constant (ceteris paribus). When the price of the good changes, there is a change in the *quantity demanded*, represented graphically as a movement from one point to another on the same demand curve. A shift in the demand curve, by contrast, represents a change in *demand* itself, meaning that at every price, a different quantity is demanded than before. This is caused by changes in non-price determinants.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: a change in the price of a complement**\nThis is incorrect because a change in the price of a complementary good is a non-price determinant that causes the demand curve to shift. Complementary goods are consumed together (e.g., printers and ink cartridges). If the price of a complement (ink cartridges) decreases, it becomes cheaper to use the primary good (printers). This will increase the demand for printers at every price level, causing the entire demand curve for printers to shift to the right. Conversely, an increase in the price of a complement would shift the demand curve to the left.\n\n**B: a change in the price of a substitute**\nThis is incorrect because a change in the price of a substitute good is a non-price determinant that causes the demand curve to shift. Substitute goods can be used in place of one another (e.g., tea and coffee). If the price of a substitute (tea) increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper alternative (coffee). This increases the demand for coffee at every price level, causing the demand curve for coffee to shift to the right. Conversely, a decrease in the price of a substitute would shift the demand curve to the left.\n\n**D: a change in consumers' incomes**\nThis is incorrect because consumer income is a fundamental non-price determinant of demand that causes the demand curve to shift. For a *normal good*, an increase in consumer income leads to an increase in demand, shifting the curve to the right.

The two goods are linked in the production process. A classic example is the production of beef and leather from cattle; increasing the output of beef necessarily increases the supply of leather. Therefore, a change in the market conditions for one good (e.g., a rise in the price of beef) will affect the supply of the other good (increase the supply of leather). Option C provides the correct definition of this relationship.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A firm can choose between producing a range of different goods.**\nThis describes **competitive supply**, not joint supply. Competitive supply exists when a producer's resources can be used to create two or more different products, but not at the same time. For example, a farmer with a plot of land must choose between growing wheat or corn. Producing more of one requires producing less of the other, as they compete for the same resources.\n\n**B. A good has multiple uses.**\nThis describes **composite demand**. Composite demand arises when a single good is demanded for two or more distinct purposes. For instance, milk is demanded for direct consumption, as well as for producing cheese, yogurt, and butter. An increase in demand for one of these uses will affect the availability and price for the other uses. This is a demand-side concept, distinct from joint supply, which is a supply-side concept.\n\n**D. Consumers consider two goods as complements.**\nThis describes **joint demand** (or complementary goods). Joint demand refers to goods that are consumed together, such as printers and ink cartridges. The demand for one good is directly linked to the demand for the other. If the price of printers falls, the quantity demanded for printers will rise, which in turn will increase the demand for ink cartridges.

The relationship between a price change and the resulting change in a firm's total revenue (TR = Price \u00d7 Quantity) is determined by the PED.\n\nIn this case, the price of the product falls by 5%, and the total revenue also falls by 5%. For the percentage change in total revenue to be identical to the percentage change in price, the quantity demanded must not have changed. If the quantity demanded does not respond at all to a change in price, the percentage change in quantity demanded is zero.\n\nThe formula for PED is:\nPED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)\n\nGiven the scenario:\nPED = 0% / -5% = 0\n\nA PED value of 0 signifies perfectly inelastic demand, which is described as 'zero' elasticity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. elastic**\nDemand is considered elastic when the PED is greater than 1. In this situation, the percentage change in quantity demanded is larger than the percentage change in price. If demand were elastic, a 5% fall in price would lead to a more than 5% increase in quantity demanded. This would cause total revenue to *rise*, as the increase in quantity sold would more than compensate for the lower price per unit. Since the total revenue fell, demand cannot be elastic.\n\n**B. infinite**\nInfinitely elastic (or perfectly elastic) demand occurs when the PED is infinite. This theoretical situation implies that consumers will purchase an unlimited quantity at a specific price, but the quantity demanded will drop to zero if the price increases even slightly. If a firm were to lower its price, it would capture the entire market, leading to a substantial, not a 5%, fall in revenue. A fall in total revenue is inconsistent with perfectly elastic demand.\n\n**C. unitary**\nUnitary elastic demand exists when the PED is exactly 1. This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal and opposite to the percentage change in price. If demand were unitary elastic, a 5% fall in price would cause a 5% rise in quantity demanded.

For biscuits it is greater than 1.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in consumer income. The formula is: YED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income).\n\nFor biscuits, as income increases from $100 to $150, the quantity demanded increases from 0 to 5 packs.\n\n*   The percentage change in income is [(150 - 100) / ((100 + 150)/2)] x 100 = (50 / 125) x 100 = 40%.\n*   When the initial quantity demanded is zero, any increase results in an infinite percentage change. The concept of elasticity in this specific case shows an extreme responsiveness. As the consumer could not afford the good at all at the lower income, and now can, the demand is highly elastic.\n\nSince the percentage change in quantity demanded (infinite) is greater than the percentage change in income (40%), the YED is mathematically undefined but considered to be infinite. An infinite YED is significantly greater than 1. Goods with a YED greater than 1 are classified as luxury goods or normal goods with high-income elasticity.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. For biscuits it is zero.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A YED of zero implies that a change in income has no effect on the quantity demanded (perfectly income inelastic). However, the table shows that as income increases from $100 to $150, the weekly consumption of biscuits increases from 0 to 5 packs. Since the quantity demanded changes in response to the change in income, the YED cannot be zero.\n\n**C. For coffee it is less than 1.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A YED of less than 1 (but greater than 0) indicates that a good is income inelastic, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in income. Let's calculate the YED for coffee using the arc elasticity method for accuracy over a range.\n\n*   Percentage change in quantity demanded for coffee = [(10 - 5) / ((10 + 5)/2)] x 100 = (5 / 7.5) x 100 \u2248 66.7%.\n*   Percentage change in income = [(150 - 100) / ((100 + 150)/2)] x 100 = (50 / 125) x 100 = 40%.\n*   YED for coffee = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Income = 66.7% / 40% \u2248 1.67.\n\nSince the calculated YED for coffee (1.67) is greater than 1, coffee is an income-elastic good (a luxury good or normal good with high-income elasticity) in this income range, not income inelastic.\n\n**D. For coffee it is unitary.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Unitary income elasticity means that the YED is exactly 1. This occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in income. As calculated above, the percentage change in quantity demanded for coffee (\u224866.7%) is not equal to the percentage change in income (40%). The calculated YED is approximately 1.67, which is not equal to 1."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_102.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "12 the diagram shows four supply curves.\nww x\nrice\np y\nzz\noo quantity\nwhich statement about the price elasticity of these supply curves is correct?\na w has elasticity of 0 that will rise as price rises.\nb_ xhas elasticity greater than 1 that will be constant as price rises.\ncy has elasticity greater than 1 that will fall as price rises.\nd_ zhas elasticity of 0 that is constant as quantity rises.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe supply curve Y is a straight line that originates from the positive vertical (price) axis. A key geometric property of such a supply curve is that its price elasticity of supply (PES) is always greater than 1, meaning supply is elastic. This occurs because for any point on the curve, the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than the percentage change in price. As one moves up along this linear supply curve to higher prices, the elasticity value, while remaining greater than 1, will decrease and approach 1. Therefore, the statement that curve Y has an elasticity greater than 1 which falls as price rises is correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. W has elasticity of 0 that will rise as price rises.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Supply curve W is a vertical line, which represents perfectly inelastic supply. This means that the quantity supplied is fixed and does not change, regardless of any change in price. The formula for PES is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price. Since the percentage change in quantity supplied is zero, the PES is always 0. The elasticity is constant at 0 and does not rise as price rises.\n\n**B. X has elasticity greater than 1 that will be constant as price rises.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Supply curve X is a straight line that passes through the origin (0,0). Any linear supply curve that originates from the origin has a constant price elasticity of supply equal to 1 (unit elastic) at all points along the curve. The statement incorrectly claims the elasticity is greater than 1.\n\n**D. Z has elasticity of 0 that is constant as quantity rises.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Supply curve Z is a horizontal line, which represents perfectly elastic supply. This means that suppliers are willing to offer any quantity at a single, specific price. A minute change in price would lead to an infinite change in the quantity supplied. Therefore, the PES is infinite (\u221e), not 0.

This means producers are highly responsive to price changes, and a small change in price leads to a more than proportionate change in the quantity supplied.\n*   A PES value between 0 and 1, such as +0.2 for Product Y, indicates that supply is **price inelastic**. This means producers are not very responsive to price changes, and a change in price leads to a less than proportionate change in the quantity supplied.\n\nBased on this, it is relatively easy for producers of X to adjust their output in response to price changes, while it is relatively difficult for producers of Y to do so. Therefore, after a price rise, it is more difficult to increase the output of Y (inelastic supply) than the output of X (elastic supply).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. X has more substitutes than Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the availability of substitutes is a determinant of the **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**, not the Price Elasticity of Supply (PES). PED measures how consumers' purchasing habits respond to a price change. PES, in contrast, measures how producers' output levels respond to a price change. The information given is about PES, so no conclusions can be drawn about the number of substitutes from a consumer's perspective.\n\n**B. A 20% price fall would lead to a greater decrease in production of Y than of X.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The percentage change in quantity supplied can be calculated using the formula: % Change in Quantity Supplied = PES \u00d7 % Change in Price.\n*   For Product X (PES = +2): The decrease in production would be 2 \u00d7 20% = 40%.\n*   For Product Y (PES = +0.2): The decrease in production would be 0.2 \u00d7 20% = 4%.\nA 20% price fall would lead to a 40% decrease in the production of X and only a 4% decrease in the production of Y. Therefore, the decrease in the production of X is greater than that of Y.\n\n**D. After a price fall of 10%, more people would buy X than would buy Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it makes a conclusion about the quantity demanded (\"more people would buy\"), which relates to the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED).

The initial equilibrium price is $20.\n    *   A minimum price of $18 (Options A and B) is below the equilibrium price. This price floor is non-binding, meaning the market will ignore it and continue to trade at the equilibrium price of $20. Consequently, there would be no change in consumer surplus.\n    *   A minimum price of $22 (Options C and D) is above the equilibrium price. This price floor is effective and will raise the market price to $22. This price increase will cause a decrease in consumer surplus. Therefore, the correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n2.  **Impact of Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** Consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the price, up to the quantity consumed. A price increase reduces this area. The magnitude of this reduction depends on the price elasticity of demand.\n    *   **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price.\n    *   **Option C (PED = -0.5):** Demand is price *inelastic*. This means that when the price increases from $20 to $22, the quantity demanded will decrease by a relatively small proportion. A large number of consumers will continue to purchase tickets, but at the higher price.\n    *   **Option D (PED = -1.5):** Demand is price *elastic*. This means that when the price increases to $22, the quantity demanded will decrease by a relatively large proportion.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Decrease in Consumer Surplus:** The decrease in consumer surplus consists of two parts:\n    *   A transfer of surplus from consumers to producers for the units that are still sold. This is represented by a rectangle with a height equal to the price increase ($22 - $20 = $2) and a width equal to the new, lower quantity demanded.\n    *   A deadweight loss representing the lost surplus from the transactions that no longer occur.\n\n    When demand is **inelastic** (Option C), the quantity demanded falls only slightly. Thus, the new quantity sold is high. The loss of surplus from consumers paying a higher price (the transfer to producers) applies to a large number of units, resulting in a very large decrease in total consumer surplus.\n\n    When demand is **elastic** (Option D), the quantity demanded falls significantly. The loss of surplus from consumers paying a higher price applies to a much smaller number of units, resulting in a smaller decrease in consumer surplus compared to the inelastic case.\n\n    Therefore, the decrease in consumer surplus is greatest when the effective minimum price is imposed on a market with inelastic demand.\n\n### Explanations of Incorrect Options\n\n**A. minimum price level $18, price elasticity of demand for tickets -0.5**\n\nThis option is incorrect because the proposed minimum price of $18 is below the market equilibrium price of $20. A price floor set below the equilibrium price is non-binding and has no effect on the market. The price will remain at $20, and the quantity sold will remain at 10,000. As there is no change in the market price or quantity, there is no decrease in consumer surplus.\n\n**B. minimum price level $18, price elasticity of demand for tickets -1.5**\n\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as option A. The minimum price of $18 is ineffective as it is below the equilibrium price of $20. The market is not impacted by this price control. The price elasticity of demand is irrelevant in this case because the price does not change, and thus consumer surplus does not decrease.\n\n**D. minimum price level $22, price elasticity of demand for tickets -1.5**\n\nThis option is incorrect because while the minimum price of $22 is effective and will cause a decrease in consumer surplus, it will not be the *largest* possible decrease. With elastic demand (PED = -1.5), a price increase from $20 to $22 causes a large reduction in the quantity of tickets demanded. Because fewer tickets are sold at the higher price, the portion of consumer surplus lost due to the price increase (which is transferred to producers) is smaller than it would be if demand were inelastic. Although there is a decrease in consumer surplus, it is less than the decrease that occurs under the conditions of inelastic demand (Option C)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_105.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "15 the diagram shows the impact of a government imposing a unit tax on a demerit good. s is the\nsupply curve before the tax and s, is the supply curve after the tax.\nprice\n$ s,\ns\n50 pewnenee nem oy\naq pans dk i\n30 4----------5%-4->\n204 eye |\n. d\n0 a\n0 5 10\nquantity\nwhat is the after-tax revenue of the firm producing the demerit good?\na $100 b $200 c $300 d $500", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe after-tax revenue of the firm is the total amount of money the producer receives after the tax has been imposed and paid to the government.

Increasing the top marginal rate directly reduces the disposable income of the highest earners. The additional government revenue generated can then be used to fund public services or transfer payments (like welfare benefits) that tend to benefit lower-income households more. This redistributes income from the top to the bottom, thereby narrowing the income gap.\n\n2.  **An increase in the minimum wage:** This policy directly increases the pre-tax earnings of the lowest-paid workers in the economy. By setting a higher wage floor, it raises the incomes of those at the bottom of the distribution, reducing the gap between the lowest and highest earners.\n\n3.  **Rejecting the subsidy on expensive cars:** A subsidy on battery-powered cars costing over $40,000 is a regressive policy. These are luxury items predominantly purchased by high-income individuals. The subsidy, therefore, represents a transfer of public funds to the wealthy, increasing their real income and thus widening the gap between the rich and the poor. Rejecting this policy is essential for any effective strategy to reduce inequality.\n\nBy combining a progressive tax increase (targeting the top) with a minimum wage hike (targeting the bottom) and rejecting a regressive subsidy, this approach provides the most comprehensive and effective strategy to reduce income inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Options Explained\n\n*   **A:** This option is less effective because it omits the increase in the minimum wage. While raising the top tax rate is a valid policy for reducing inequality, failing to also directly support the incomes of the lowest-paid workers means a key tool is being ignored. A strategy that addresses only the top of the income distribution is not as comprehensive as one that addresses both the top and the bottom.\n\n*   **C:** This option is ineffective and contradictory. While it correctly includes an increase in the progressive tax rate, it also includes a subsidy on luxury cars. This subsidy is a regressive measure that would transfer wealth to high-income earners, directly counteracting the goal of reducing income inequality. Implementing a policy that worsens inequality cannot be part of an effective strategy to reduce it.\n\n*   **D:** This option is less effective because it omits the increase in the marginal tax rate. Progressive taxation is one of the most direct and powerful tools a government has to redistribute income and reduce inequality. Relying solely on a minimum wage increase, while helpful for low-income earners, does not address the high incomes at the top of the distribution, making the overall strategy less impactful than one that also includes progressive tax reform."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_107.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "17 a bangladeshi citizen is employed as a construction worker in qatar. he sends some of his\nwages to his family in bangladesh.\nhow will this be recorded on qatar\u2019s balance of payments?\na as part of the balance of trade in services\nb as part of net primary income\ncas part of net secondary income\ndas part of the financial account", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (B)\n\nThe correct answer is **B**, as the transaction is recorded as part of net primary income on Qatar's balance of payments.\n\nThe **balance of payments** records all economic transactions between a country's residents and the rest of the world. It is primarily divided into the current account, the capital account, and the financial account. The transaction described falls under the **current account**.\n\nThe current account itself has several components, including the balance of trade (in goods and services), primary income, and secondary income.\n\n*   **Primary income** (or net factor income from abroad) records income earned by residents from non-residents, and income paid to non-residents, in return for the use of factors of production (labour, land, capital).

The wages he earns are a payment for this factor. When he sends this money home, it is recorded as a primary income outflow (a debit) for Qatar, because it is income generated in Qatar that is being paid to a non-resident's household (or repatriated by a foreign factor of production).\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: as part of the balance of trade in services:** The trade in services account records payments for services such as tourism, transportation, and financial services. While the worker provides labour services, payments to individuals for their labour (compensation of employees) are specifically classified under primary income, not the general trade in services category. Trade in services typically refers to transactions between firms or a firm and an individual for a specified service output (e.g., hiring a foreign consulting firm), rather than employment income.\n\n*   **C: as part of net secondary income:** Secondary income (or current transfers) records one-way transfers where no good, service, or factor of production is provided in return. Examples include international aid and personal gifts. While workers' remittances are often cited as an example of a transfer, in the context of the balance of payments accounts, the income is fundamentally a payment for the factor of labour. Therefore, it is more precisely classified as primary income. The key distinction is that the payment is *earned* in exchange for labour, distinguishing it from a pure transfer like a gift.\n\n*   **D: as part of the financial account:** The financial account records transactions involving financial assets and liabilities, such as foreign direct investment (buying a company), portfolio investment (buying stocks or bonds), and other investments. The worker sending wages home is a current income flow for consumption or saving; it is not a purchase of a financial asset in Bangladesh by a Qatari resident, nor does it create a financial claim or liability.

This policy directly affects the relative prices of exports and imports. A weaker domestic currency makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which tends to increase the quantity demanded for exports. Simultaneously, it makes imports more expensive for domestic consumers, which tends to reduce the quantity demanded for imports. The combined effect of rising export revenue and falling import expenditure will improve the current account balance, moving it from a deficit (adverse balance) towards a surplus or balance. This outcome is dependent on the Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that the sum of the price elasticities of demand for exports and imports must be greater than one for a depreciation to be successful.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**A) Abolishing tariffs:** Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, designed to make them more expensive and reduce their demand. Abolishing tariffs would have the opposite effect: it would lower the price of imported goods for domestic consumers. This would likely lead to an increase in the quantity and value of imports, thereby worsening the current account deficit, not correcting it.\n\n**C) Reducing direct taxes:** Direct taxes, such as income tax and corporation tax, are levied on income and profits. A reduction in direct taxes increases the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms. This leads to higher overall spending (aggregate demand) in the economy. A portion of this increased spending will inevitably be on imported goods and services. Therefore, reducing direct taxes is likely to increase import expenditure and worsen the current account deficit.\n\n**D) Reducing indirect taxes:** Indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, are levied on goods and services. Reducing these taxes lowers the final price of goods for consumers, increasing their real income and purchasing power. This encourages higher consumption.

The table presents an index for the terms of trade, which is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Terms of Trade Index} = \\frac{\\text{Index of Export Prices}}{\\text{Index of Import Prices}} \\times 100\n$$\nThe index measures the relative price of a country's exports in terms of its imports. A decrease in the terms of trade index signifies a **deterioration**. This means that, on average, export prices have fallen relative to import prices. Consequently, the country must export a larger volume of goods to finance the same volume of imports. The data shows the index falling from 100 in the base year 2013, to 97 in 2014, and further to 95 in 2015. This continuous decline indicates a deterioration in the terms of trade over the period.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Export prices have increased each year.**\nThis statement is not necessarily correct. The terms of trade index is a ratio of export prices to import prices. The index can fall for several reasons, not just because export prices have fallen. For example, if import prices rise at a faster rate than export prices, the terms of trade will still deteriorate. Without data on the individual price movements of exports and imports, it is impossible to conclude how export prices alone have changed.\n\n**B. The general level of prices has fallen.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The terms of trade index relates specifically to the prices of internationally traded goods (exports and imports). It does not provide information about the general price level within the economy, which is typically measured by a broader index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI includes the prices of non-traded goods and services. An economy can experience domestic inflation (a rise in the general price level) even while its terms of trade are deteriorating.\n\n**D. The volume of imports increasingly exceeds the volume of exports.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The terms of trade index is a measure of relative *prices*, not *volumes* (quantities). It provides no information about the quantity of goods being exported or imported. Changes in the terms of trade can influence trade volumes, but the index itself does not describe them. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from the given data about the relative volumes of imports and exports."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_113.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 country x and country y each allocate half of their resources towards the manufacturing of\nshoes, and the other half towards the manufacturing of t-shirts. resources can be used equally\neffectively in the production of both products in both countries.\n\nthe table shows the output of shoes and t-shirts produced by both countries using half their\nresources in each case, before specialisation.\n\nx 4000 12000\n\ny 2000 8000\n\ntotal 6000 20000\n\nwhat can be concluded from the data?\na_ the opportunity cost of country y producing two shoes is four t-shirts.\nb_ the opportunity cost of country x producing one t-shirt is four shoes.\nc_ the total output of shoes and t-shirts after specialisation would be 24000.\nd_ the total output of shoes and t-shirts after specialisation would be 28 000.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis conclusion is derived from the principle of comparative advantage, which states that countries should specialise in producing the good for which they have the lowest opportunity cost.\n\n1.  **Determine Maximum Potential Output:** The table shows output using half of each country's resources. To find the maximum production potential (the Production Possibility Frontier), we must double these figures.\n    *   Country X can produce either 8,000 shoes (4,000 x 2) or 24,000 t-shirts (12,000 x 2).\n    *   Country Y can produce either 4,000 shoes (2,000 x 2) or 16,000 t-shirts (8,000 x 2).\n\n2.  **Calculate Opportunity Costs:**\n    *   **Opportunity cost of 1 shoe:**\n        *   Country X gives up 24,000 t-shirts to make 8,000 shoes.

The opportunity cost of country Y producing two shoes is four t-shirts.**\nThis is incorrect. To determine the opportunity cost for Country Y, we compare its maximum potential output of shoes and t-shirts. Country Y can produce either 4,000 shoes or 16,000 t-shirts. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 4,000 shoes is 16,000 t-shirts. The opportunity cost of one shoe is 16,000 t-shirts / 4,000 shoes = 4 t-shirts. Consequently, the opportunity cost of producing two shoes is 2 x 4 = 8 t-shirts, not four.\n\n**B. The opportunity cost of country X producing one t-shirt is four shoes.**\nThis is incorrect. To determine the opportunity cost for Country X, we compare its maximum potential output of shoes and t-shirts. Country X can produce either 24,000 t-shirts or 8,000 shoes. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 24,000 t-shirts is 8,000 shoes. The opportunity cost of producing one t-shirt is 8,000 shoes / 24,000 t-shirts = 1/3 of a shoe, not four shoes.\n\n**D. The total output of shoes and t-shirts after specialisation would be 28,000.**\nThis is incorrect. Specialisation occurs based on comparative advantage. As calculated for the correct answer, Country X should specialise in shoes (producing 8,000) and Country Y in t-shirts (producing 16,000). The total combined output is 8,000 + 16,000 = 24,000 units.

Such controls would restrict the amount of credit available in the economy. This makes it more difficult and expensive for both firms and consumers to borrow money. For firms, this leads to a reduction in investment in new capital, technology, and expansion projects. Since investment is a key component of Aggregate Demand (AD), a decrease in investment will dampen AD and slow down economic growth. In the long run, lower investment also hinders the growth of the economy's productive capacity (Long-Run Aggregate Supply). Therefore, this action would likely contribute to, rather than prevent, a fall in economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: relaxation of rules for immigration of adult population**\nThis is a supply-side policy that would increase the size of the country's labour force. An increase in the quantity of labour, a primary factor of production, expands the economy's productive potential. This shifts the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right. A larger population also increases overall consumption, boosting Aggregate Demand. Both effects are conducive to economic growth, making this policy likely to prevent a fall in growth.\n\n**C: removal of trade barriers on import of raw materials**\nThis policy of trade liberalisation would lower the cost of production for domestic firms that rely on imported inputs. Lower production costs lead to a rightward shift in the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve, resulting in higher national output (economic growth) and potentially lower price levels. By making production cheaper and more efficient, this policy encourages economic activity and would help to prevent a fall in economic growth.\n\n**D: training and education of workforce**\nInvesting in training and education is a long-term supply-side policy aimed at improving the quality of the workforce, also known as increasing human capital. A more skilled and educated labour force is more productive, meaning it can produce more output with the same amount of resources. This increase in productivity is a fundamental driver of long-term economic growth and raises the economy's potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the right. Consequently, this is a key policy for preventing a fall in economic growth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_115.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 what is the most likely cause of an outward shift of a country\u2019s aggregate demand curve?\na adecrease in the competitiveness of domestically produced products\nb  adecrease in the general price level\nc  adecrease in the money supply\nd  adepreciation of the country\u2019s exchange rate", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn outward (rightward) shift of the aggregate demand (AD) curve signifies an increase in the total demand for a country's goods and services at any given price level. Aggregate demand is calculated as AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, and (X - M) is net exports (exports minus imports).\n\nA depreciation of the country's exchange rate means its currency is now worth less relative to other currencies. This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, leading to an increase in the quantity and value of exports (X). Simultaneously, it makes imports more expensive for domestic consumers, leading to a decrease in the demand for imported goods (M). The combined effect of rising exports and falling imports increases net exports (X - M), which is a key component of aggregate demand. This increase in (X - M) causes the entire AD curve to shift outwards.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. a decrease in the competitiveness of domestically produced products**\nA decrease in competitiveness implies that domestic goods have become relatively more expensive or lower in quality compared to foreign goods. This would lead to a decrease in demand for exports (X falls) and an increase in demand for imports (M rises). The result is a decrease in net exports (X - M), which would cause the aggregate demand curve to shift inwards (to the left), not outwards.\n\n**B. a decrease in the general price level**\nA change in the general price level causes a movement *along* the aggregate demand curve, not a *shift* of the curve. The AD curve is downward sloping, indicating that a lower price level leads to a higher quantity of aggregate demand. This movement is due to the wealth, interest rate, and international trade effects. However, for the entire curve to shift, a non-price determinant of aggregate demand must change.\n\n**C. a decrease in the money supply**\nA decrease in the money supply is a contractionary monetary policy. It typically leads to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms, which discourages consumption (C) and investment (I).

This policy increases the disposable income of households. With more money available after tax, consumers are likely to increase their overall spending. A portion of this increased expenditure will be on imported goods and services. This rise in the demand for imports increases the value of total imports (M). The current account surplus is calculated as the value of exports minus the value of imports (X \u2013 M). Therefore, with exports (X) remaining unchanged in the short run, an increase in imports (M) will directly lead to a reduction in the current account surplus.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: a decrease in regulations to encourage more foreign firms to locate in this country**\n\nThis is a supply-side policy aimed at attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The immediate effect of FDI is an inflow of capital, which is recorded in the financial account of the balance of payments, not the current account. While these new firms might import capital goods, the long-term goal of this policy is often to boost domestic production and potentially exports. An increase in exports would enlarge the current account surplus, which is the opposite of the intended outcome. Therefore, this policy does not directly or reliably reduce the current account surplus in the short run.\n\n**C: an increase of import duties**\n\nAn increase in import duties (tariffs) is a protectionist policy that raises the price of imported goods for domestic consumers and firms. According to the law of demand, a higher price for imports will lead to a decrease in the quantity of imports demanded. This reduction in spending on imports (M) would cause the current account surplus (X \u2013 M) to *increase*, which is the opposite of the policy objective.\n\n**D: an increase in interest rates**\n\nAn increase in interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that has two main, but conflicting, effects on the current account.\n1.  **Exchange Rate Effect:** Higher interest rates attract inflows of foreign financial capital, increasing the demand for the domestic currency and causing it to appreciate. A stronger currency makes the country's exports more expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for domestic residents. This would cause exports (X) to fall and imports (M) to rise, thereby reducing the current account surplus.\n2.  **Income Effect:** Higher interest rates also discourage domestic consumption and investment, leading to a fall in aggregate demand and national income. Lower income reduces overall spending, including spending on imports (M). A fall in imports would *increase* the current account surplus.\n\nSince these two effects work in opposite directions, the net impact on the current account is ambiguous.

This is typically caused by a decrease in the costs of production. A decrease in raw material costs lowers firms' expenses, making production more profitable and incentivising them to increase output, thus shifting the SRAS curve to the right.\n\nA rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, from LRAS to LRAS\u2081, represents an increase in the economy's potential output or productive capacity. This is caused by an increase in the quantity or quality of factors of production. Improvements in the education of workers increase their skills and efficiency, which is an improvement in the quality of labour (human capital). This leads to higher labour productivity and a greater potential output for the economy, shifting the LRAS curve to the right.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: change in AD from W to Y / increase in population**\nThe movement from point W to point Y is a movement along the aggregate demand (AD) curve, which is a result of the change in the price level caused by the SRAS shift, not a cause of the SRAS shift itself. A change in AD would involve a shift of the entire AD curve. Therefore, the first part of this option is incorrect.\n\n**C: decrease in wage rates / decrease in immigration**\nWhile a decrease in wage rates would correctly cause a rightward shift in the SRAS curve by lowering production costs, a decrease in immigration would reduce the size of the available labour force. A smaller labour force decreases the economy's productive capacity, which would cause the LRAS curve to shift to the left, not to the right as shown in the diagram.\n\n**D: increase in availability of labour / increase in labour productivity**\nBoth an increase in the availability of labour and an increase in labour productivity are factors that increase an economy's potential output, causing the LRAS curve to shift to the right. Factors that shift the LRAS also shift the SRAS. However, the combination in option B provides a more distinct explanation, with a change in input prices (raw materials) affecting the SRAS and an improvement in the quality of a factor of production (education) affecting the LRAS. A change in raw material costs is a classic cause of a shift in SRAS that does not necessarily affect LRAS."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_119.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "29 the diagram shows that the imposition of a tariff raises a product\u2019s world price from $10 to $14.\ndomestic supply\nprice\n$\n14 psscsemneeacicneg fe oscnamscnsnnae ess\nq0 a \u201ca a domestic\n, | 1 demand\n0 ' i 1 ;\n0 20 30 70 100\nquantity (millions)\nby how much did domestic producers\u2019 income increase as a result of the tariff?\na $120 million b $160million c $220 million d $280 million", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation**\nDomestic producers' income is their total revenue, calculated as the price they receive multiplied by the quantity they sell (Price \u00d7 Quantity).\n\n1.  **Income before the tariff:** The initial world price is $10.

Economics is the study of how to manage this problem. The efficient allocation of scarce resources is the process of distributing and using these limited resources in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of wants and minimises waste. By achieving allocative and productive efficiency, an economy comes as close as possible to 'solving' the economic problem by making the best possible use of what it has.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. the control of the market system**\nControlling the market system, as seen in a command or planned economy, is one method of addressing the three basic economic questions (what, how, and for whom to produce). However, it is not a solution to the economic problem itself. The fundamental issue of scarcity\u2014unlimited wants versus limited resources\u2014persists regardless of whether resource allocation is determined by a central authority or by free market forces. Both systems are simply different mechanisms for making the choices necessitated by scarcity.\n\n**C. the preservation of a healthy environment**\nThe preservation of a healthy environment is a specific economic objective and represents one of many competing wants. Achieving this goal requires the allocation of scarce resources (such as land, labour, and capital) towards environmental protection and away from other areas, like the production of consumer goods or services. This decision-making process, involving trade-offs and opportunity costs, is a manifestation of the basic economic problem, not a solution to it.\n\n**D. the elimination of hunger**\nThe elimination of hunger would satisfy a fundamental and critical human want. However, it would not solve the basic economic problem. Human wants are considered to be infinite in aggregate. Even if the want for food were completely satisfied for every person, countless other wants for better housing, healthcare, education, and consumer goods would remain.

This allows for an increase in the production of **both** good X and good Y. Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the next-best alternative that must be forgone to achieve something. In this case, to get more of both goods, no production of either good needs to be sacrificed. Therefore, the opportunity cost of moving from an inefficient point (1) to an efficient point (3) is zero.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1 to 2**\n\nThis movement is also from an inefficient point (1) to an efficient point (2) on the PPC. Similar to the movement from 1 to 3, this is achieved by employing previously idle resources, which allows for an increase in the output of both goods. As such, this movement also has a zero opportunity cost in terms of goods produced.

The key takeaway is that any move from inside the PPC to the curve itself represents an efficiency gain with no opportunity cost.\n\n**C: 2 to 3**\n\nThis movement occurs **along** the PPC. Both point 2 and point 3 are productively efficient, meaning all resources are fully employed. To increase the production of good X (moving from 2 to 3), resources must be reallocated from the production of good Y. This inevitably means that the output of good Y must decrease. The amount of good Y that is given up is the opportunity cost of producing more good X. Since some amount of good Y must be sacrificed, the opportunity cost is greater than zero.\n\n**D: 3 to 4**\n\nSimilar to the movement from 2 to 3, this is a movement along the PPC between two efficient points. To produce more of good X (moving from 3 to 4), the economy must shift resources away from producing good Y, causing a reduction in the output of good Y. This trade-off signifies a positive opportunity cost. The concave shape of the PPC also implies an increasing opportunity cost, meaning the amount of good Y given up to produce an additional unit of X is even greater when moving from 3 to 4 than it was when moving from 2 to 3."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_123.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "3  accountry\u2019s health care is funded by taxation but can be used free of charge by patients.\nwhich type of good is health care in this country?\na demerit good\nb_ free good\nc private good\nd public good", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nHealth care is classified as a **private good** based on its inherent economic characteristics. A private good is defined by two key features: it is **rivalrous** and **excludable**.\n\n*   **Rivalrous:** The consumption of the good by one person prevents another person from consuming it simultaneously. For example, a doctor attending to one patient cannot treat another at the same time. Similarly, a hospital bed occupied by one patient is unavailable to others. This demonstrates that health care is rivalrous.\n*   **Excludable:** It is possible to prevent individuals who do not pay for the good from consuming it. In a market-based system, a private hospital can refuse treatment to someone who is unable or unwilling to pay.\n\nThe method of funding (taxation) and provision (free at the point of use) does not change the fundamental nature of the good itself. The government is choosing to fund and provide a private good to the public, often because it is also considered a **merit good**. However, its classification remains that of a private good due to its rivalrous and excludable nature.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: demerit good**\n\nA demerit good is a product or service whose consumption is considered unhealthy, degrading, or otherwise socially undesirable due to the negative effects on the consumers themselves and/or society. Examples include tobacco and alcohol. Governments often seek to discourage the consumption of demerit goods through taxation or regulation. Health care is the opposite; it generates positive effects (positive externalities) for both the individual and society and is considered a **merit good**, which the government often encourages.\n\n**B: free good**\n\nA free good is a good that is not scarce and therefore has a zero opportunity cost of production. Its supply is so abundant that everyone can have as much as they want without any cost. Examples include air and sunlight. Health care, in contrast, is a scarce economic good. It requires significant resources, including skilled labour (doctors, nurses), capital (hospitals, equipment), and land. These resources have alternative uses, meaning there is a high opportunity cost associated with providing health care. The fact that it is provided \"free of charge\" to the patient does not make it a \"free good\" in the economic sense; the cost is simply borne by taxpayers rather than by the patient directly.\n\n**D: public good**\n\nA public good is defined by two specific characteristics: it must be **non-rivalrous** and **non-excludable**.\n*   **Non-rivalrous:** One person's consumption does not diminish the amount available for others (e.g., street lighting).\n*   **Non-excludable:** It is not possible to prevent people from using the good, even if they do not pay for it (e.g., national defence).\nHealth care fails both of these tests. As explained above, it is rivalrous and excludable. The provision of a good by the government does not automatically make it a public good. When the state provides a good that has the characteristics of a private good, such as health care or education, it is sometimes referred to as a **quasi-public good**, but its fundamental classification is not that of a pure public good."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_124.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "4 what is least likely to increase as a result of a transition from a planned economy to a free\nmarket economy?\na prices of goods and services\nb privately owned resources\nc provision of merit goods\nd - structural unemployment", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn a planned economy, the government is the primary provider of goods and services. It typically allocates significant resources to the provision of merit goods, such as education and healthcare, which are often supplied free of charge or at a heavily subsidised price to ensure widespread access. The transition to a free market economy involves a reduction in the economic role of the state and an increased reliance on the price mechanism. Free markets tend to under-provide and under-consume merit goods because their provision is based on the ability to pay rather than need, and the positive externalities associated with their consumption are ignored by private firms. As the government withdraws from the economy and cuts public expenditure, funding for merit goods is often reduced. Consequently, the overall provision of merit goods is likely to decrease, not increase, making this the least likely outcome.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. prices of goods and services**\n\nThis is incorrect because prices are very likely to increase during a transition from a planned to a free market economy. In a planned system, prices are often set artificially low by the state, especially for essential goods, through the use of subsidies. Price liberalisation, a key component of the transition, involves removing these subsidies and allowing prices to be determined by the market forces of supply and demand. This typically results in a significant, and often rapid, increase in the general price level as prices adjust upwards to their market equilibrium.\n\n**B. privately owned resources**\n\nThis is incorrect because an increase in privately owned resources is a fundamental characteristic of the transition to a market economy. A planned economy is defined by state ownership of the factors of production (land, capital). The transition process involves privatisation, whereby state-owned enterprises, land, and other assets are transferred to private individuals and firms. Therefore, the quantity and value of privately owned resources will necessarily increase.\n\n**D. structural unemployment**\n\nThis is incorrect because structural unemployment is highly likely to increase during the transition. In planned economies, state-owned industries are often inefficient and overstaffed. As the economy moves towards a market-based system, these industries must restructure to become competitive or face closure. This restructuring leads to large-scale redundancies. The workers who lose their jobs may lack the specific skills required by the new, emerging industries in the private sector. This mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for available jobs is known as structural unemployment.

For a linear (straight-line) demand curve, the value of PED is different at every point.\n\n1.  **Effect on the value of PED (Movement from X to Y):**\n    As we move down a linear demand curve, the price decreases and the quantity demanded increases. The PED value also changes. The upper, higher-priced portion of the demand curve is price elastic (PED > 1). The midpoint is unit elastic (PED = 1). The lower, lower-priced portion of the demand curve is price inelastic (PED < 1).\n    The movement from point X to point Y is a movement down the demand curve, from a higher price and lower quantity to a lower price and higher quantity. This means moving from a more elastic part of the curve towards a less elastic part. Therefore, the numerical value of PED falls.\n\n    *   At point X (P=$1.5, Q=3,000), demand is elastic. The PED value is |(\u0394Q/Q) / (\u0394P/P)|. We can calculate the point elasticity: PED = |(dQ/dP) * (P/Q)|. The slope (dP/dQ) is constant: (0-2)/(12-0) = -1/6. Thus, dQ/dP = -6. At X, PED = |-6 * (1.5/3)| = 3.\n    *   At point Y (P=$0.5, Q=9,000), PED = |-6 * (0.5/9)| = 1/3.\n    *   The value of PED decreases from 3 to 1/3, confirming that it falls.\n\n2.  **Value of PED at point Y:**\n    As calculated above, the PED at point Y is 1/3 (or approximately 0.33). Since this value is less than 1, demand at point Y is described as **inelastic**.

This situation arises when the current market price is above the equilibrium price. In a free market, the price mechanism works to eliminate surpluses and shortages. When a surplus exists, sellers have an incentive to lower their prices to sell their excess inventory.\n\nAccording to the law of demand, a fall in price will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve). According to the law of supply, a fall in price will lead to a decrease in the quantity supplied (a movement along the supply curve). Both effects work together to reduce the surplus. This process of price adjustment continues until the price falls to the equilibrium level, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, and the market clears.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in demand:**\nA decrease in demand, represented by a leftward shift of the demand curve, would mean that at any given price, consumers wish to buy less of the good.

This would prevent the market mechanism from efficiently allocating the scarce parking spaces on those three days.\n\n**B: set a fixed price at P\u2084**\n\nA fixed price of P\u2084 would only be the market-clearing price on the day with the highest demand (D\u2084).

Revenue would increase if the price was decreased from $40 to $30.**\n\nThis statement is correct. To evaluate it, we must calculate the total revenue at each price point. Total revenue is calculated by multiplying the price by the quantity demanded (TR = P x Q).\n\n*   At a price of $40, the quantity demanded is 100 units.\n    Total Revenue = $40 \u00d7 100 = $4,000.\n*   At a price of $30, the quantity demanded is 200 units.\n    Total Revenue = $30 \u00d7 200 = $6,000.\n\nBy decreasing the price from $40 to $30, total revenue increases from $4,000 to $6,000. This occurs because demand in this price range is price elastic; the percentage increase in quantity demanded (100%) is greater than the percentage decrease in price (25%), leading to higher overall revenue.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Profit would be maximised at a price of $30.**\n\nThis statement cannot be confirmed with the given information. Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost (Profit = TR - TC). While the demand schedule allows us to calculate total revenue, it provides no information about the costs of production (e.g., fixed costs, variable costs, or marginal costs). Without cost data, it is impossible to determine the profit-maximising price. The price that maximises revenue is not necessarily the same as the price that maximises profit.\n\n**B. Profit would not change if the price rose from $20 to $30.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While total revenue is the same at both price points ($20 \u00d7 300 = $6,000 and $30 \u00d7 200 = $6,000), profit would almost certainly change. To raise the price from $20 to $30, the firm would decrease its output from 300 units to 200 units. Assuming the firm has positive marginal costs (i.e., it costs something to produce each additional unit), the total cost of producing 200 units would be less than the total cost of producing 300 units. Since total revenue remains constant at $6,000 while total costs would fall, profit would increase.\n\n**D. Revenue would be maximised at a price of $40.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. By calculating total revenue at each price point, we can identify the maximum.\n*   TR at $50 = $50 \u00d7 0 = $0\n*   TR at $40 = $40 \u00d7 100 = $4,000\n*   TR at $30 = $30 \u00d7 200 = $6,000\n*   TR at $20 = $20 \u00d7 300 = $6,000\n*   TR at $10 = $10 \u00d7 400 = $4,000\n*   TR at $0 = $0 \u00d7 500 = $0\n\nThe maximum revenue shown in the schedule is $6,000, which occurs at prices of $30 and $20. Revenue at a price of $40 is only $4,000, which is not the maximum."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_132.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "12 which event is most likely to enable firms to respond to an increase in demand by increasing\nsupply rather than by raising price?\na firms reduce their expenditure on the training of workers.\nb_ import duties are increased on machines that increase the speed of production.\nc_ the government introduces buffer stock schemes for the goods produced by the firm.\nd_ trade unions become strong, leading to poor labour productivity.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA buffer stock scheme is a system of intervention designed to stabilise the price of a commodity. It involves a central authority buying and storing goods during periods of surplus and selling them from these stores (the \"buffer stock\") during periods of shortage. If demand for a good suddenly increases, the authority can release goods from its buffer stock onto the market. This immediate increase in the quantity supplied helps to meet the higher demand without putting upward pressure on the price. Therefore, the existence of a buffer stock enables the market to respond to an increase in demand by increasing supply, keeping the price stable. This makes the supply of the good highly price elastic.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Reducing expenditure on the training of workers would likely lead to a decrease in labour productivity and skill levels. A less skilled workforce is less adaptable and efficient, making it more difficult for firms to increase their rate of production in response to higher demand. This would make the supply of the good more price inelastic, meaning an increase in demand would more likely lead to a price increase rather than a significant increase in output.\n\n**B:** An increase in import duties on production machinery raises the cost of capital equipment for firms. This discourages investment in new, more efficient technology and makes it more expensive to expand production capacity. As a result, firms' ability to ramp up production is constrained. This constraint makes supply more price inelastic, causing firms to respond to an increase in demand primarily by raising prices, as they cannot easily or cheaply increase the quantity supplied.\n\n**D:** The scenario describes strong trade unions leading to poor labour productivity. A decline in labour productivity means that more labour input is required to produce each unit of output, increasing the firm's marginal cost of production. This makes it more difficult and expensive for the firm to increase its output. This would cause the supply curve to become steeper (more price inelastic) and potentially shift to the left. Consequently, when faced with an increase in demand, the firm's limited and more costly ability to increase production would necessitate a price rise to cover higher costs and ration the limited supply."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_133.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13 in the diagram, s, is the supply curve and d, is the initial demand for facemask x. a rival firm\n\nproduces facemask y, which is a close substitute.\n\nprice of s;\n\nfacemask x\n\nd,\nd,\n[@) ,\nquantity of facemask x\n\nwhat would cause the demand curve to shift to d2?\na adecrease in the costs of the materials to make facemask x\nb  adecrease in the costs of the materials to make facemask y\nc_anincrease in the price of facemask x\nd_anincrease in the price of facemask y", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn increase in the price of facemask Y would cause the demand curve for facemask X to shift to the right from D1 to D2. Facemasks X and Y are identified as close substitutes, meaning consumers can use one in place of the other. If the price of facemask Y rises, it becomes more expensive relative to facemask X. Consequently, consumers will switch their preference from the more costly facemask Y to the relatively cheaper facemask X. This leads to a higher quantity of facemask X being demanded at every price level, which is represented graphically as a rightward shift of the entire demand curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** A decrease in the cost of materials to produce facemask X affects the conditions of supply, not demand. Lower production costs would make it more profitable for firms to produce facemask X at any given price, leading to an increase in supply. This would be shown as a rightward shift of the supply curve (S1), not the demand curve.\n\n**B:** A decrease in the cost of materials to make facemask Y would lead to an increase in the supply of Y, likely causing its market price to fall. Since facemask Y is a substitute for facemask X, a lower price for Y would make it more attractive to consumers. This would cause consumers to switch from X to Y, thereby *decreasing* the demand for facemask X and shifting its demand curve to the left, which is the opposite of the shift shown from D1 to D2.\n\n**C:** An increase in the price of facemask X would cause a decrease in the *quantity demanded* of facemask X, which is represented by a movement upwards and to the left *along* the existing demand curve (D1).

Excludability is a characteristic of a good or service whereby a consumer can be prevented from using it if they do not pay. In this context, the government must have a mechanism to enforce the charge, such as toll booths, electronic gantries with number plate recognition, or permits. These systems make it possible to exclude drivers who have not paid, which is the fundamental requirement for any pricing system to function. By charging a fee, the government increases the private cost of driving, which incentivises some drivers to switch to other forms of transport or travel at different times, thereby reducing congestion. Without excludability, the charge could not be enforced, and the policy would fail.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: The roads must be merit goods.**\nA merit good is a good that is considered beneficial for society but is likely to be under-consumed in a free market (e.g., education, healthcare). While roads can be seen as providing benefits to society (positive externalities), classifying them as a merit good is not a prerequisite for the success of a congestion charge. A congestion charge is a market-based policy designed to correct a market failure (the negative externality of congestion). Its success depends on the technical ability to charge users (excludability) and the responsiveness of demand to the price change, not on whether the good is normatively judged to be a 'merit' good.\n\n**C: The roads must be non-rivalrous.**\nA good is non-rivalrous if one person's consumption does not diminish the amount available for others. The very problem the government is trying to solve\u2014congestion\u2014arises because the roads have become **rivalrous**. When a road is congested, each additional vehicle slows down all other vehicles, reducing the quality and speed of travel for everyone else. Therefore, the policy is implemented precisely because the roads are rivalrous in consumption, not non-rivalrous. If they were non-rivalrous, there would be no congestion to reduce.\n\n**D: The roads must be public goods.**\nPublic goods are defined by two key characteristics: they are **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous**. This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option C, congested roads are rivalrous. Secondly, and more importantly, the policy of introducing a charge requires the roads to be made **excludable**. This is the direct opposite of the non-excludable nature of a pure public good.

The initial horizontal section is known as the Keynesian range. In this range, the economy is operating with significant spare capacity, such as high unemployment and underutilised capital. If the economy's initial equilibrium is determined by the intersection of the AS curve and the AD\u2081 curve, it lies within this horizontal range.\n\nA government policy that increases aggregate demand (such as expansionary fiscal or monetary policy) will shift the AD curve to the right, for example, from AD\u2081 to AD\u2082. Because there are abundant unemployed resources, firms can increase production to meet this higher demand without bidding up wages or other input costs. Consequently, output increases, but the general price level remains constant. This outcome perfectly matches the scenario described in the question. Therefore, the initial level of aggregate demand must have been AD\u2081.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B AD\u2082:** The AD\u2082 curve intersects the AS curve at the \"knee,\" where the AS curve begins to slope upwards. At this point, the economy is approaching its full employment level of output, and spare capacity is diminishing. If AD\u2082 were the initial level, any government action to increase output would shift the AD curve further to the right (e.g., to AD\u2083). This would move the equilibrium along the upward-sloping portion of the AS curve, resulting in an increase in *both* output and the price level. This contradicts the condition that there was no effect on the price level.\n\n**C AD\u2083:** The AD\u2083 curve intersects the AS curve on its upward-sloping (or intermediate) range. In this range, the economy is close to full employment, and resource bottlenecks are beginning to appear. To increase output, firms must compete for scarcer resources, which drives up production costs. These higher costs are then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Therefore, an increase in aggregate demand from AD\u2083 would cause both output and the price level to rise, which is inconsistent with the information given.\n\n**D AD\u2084:** The AD\u2084 curve intersects the AS curve further along its upward-sloping range, indicating that the economy is operating even closer to its maximum productive capacity. In this situation, a rightward shift in the AD curve would lead to a substantial increase in the price level (demand-pull inflation) for a relatively small increase in output.

Benefits paid to the unemployed are classified as **transfer payments**. A transfer payment is a redistribution of income by the government for which no corresponding good or service is produced in the current period. The government collects tax revenue (which is already part of the national income calculation) and transfers it to individuals, such as the unemployed. Including these benefits would result in double-counting and would inflate the true value of the nation's output. Therefore, transfer payments are excluded from the measurement of national income.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: dividends paid to shareholders**\nDividends are a portion of a company's profits that are distributed to its shareholders. Profit is the return to the factor of production 'enterprise' for organising production and bearing risks. Since dividends are a component of this factor income, they represent a payment for a productive contribution and are therefore included in the measurement of national income under the income approach.\n\n**C: profits retained by companies**\nRetained profits (or undistributed profits) are the part of a company's total profits that are not paid out as dividends but are kept by the company, typically for reinvestment. Total corporate profit is a key component of national income as it is the reward to the factor of production 'enterprise'. This total profit is accounted for in the national income calculation before it is divided into taxes, dividends, and retained profits. Consequently, retained profits are included in the measurement of national income.\n\n**D: rent paid to landlords**\nRent is the payment made for the use of the factor of production 'land'. This includes payments for the use of land itself as well as buildings and other property situated on it. As a direct payment for the services of a productive resource, rent is a fundamental component of factor income.

Therefore, there is no incentive for Country Y to engage in trade.\n*   **C: 1M for 1N:** These terms of trade are exactly equal to Country X's domestic opportunity cost of producing good M. Country X would gain no advantage from trading at this rate, as it could produce good M domestically for the same cost in terms of good N. Therefore, there is no incentive for Country X to engage in trade.\n*   **D: 1M for 2N:** These terms of trade lie outside the mutually beneficial range. While this rate would be highly advantageous for Country Y (the exporter of M), Country X would not agree to it. Country X can produce 1 unit of M domestically by forgoing only 1 unit of N. It would be irrational for Country X to give up 2 units of N to import something it can produce for half that cost."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_141.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "21 why is increased government provision of education most likely to shift the aggregate demand\ncurve to the right?\na it will increase aggregate supply.\nb- more schools will be built.\nc_ the government will have to raise taxes.\nd workers will be more highly skilled.", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nIncreased government provision of education constitutes an increase in government spending (G), which is a direct component of aggregate demand (AD). The formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + (X-M), where G represents government expenditure. When the government spends more on education, this includes expenditure on resources, teacher salaries, and capital projects such as the construction of new schools. The act of building more schools is a direct injection of government spending into the economy, increasing the total demand for goods and services at any given price level. This causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right.\n\n***\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A) It will increase aggregate supply.**\n    This statement describes a long-term, supply-side effect of investment in education, not the immediate effect on aggregate demand. A more educated and skilled workforce increases labour productivity, which enhances the economy's productive potential. This would lead to a rightward shift of the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. However, the question specifically asks for the reason behind the shift in the aggregate *demand* curve.\n\n*   **C) The government will have to raise taxes.**\n    This is a potential method for financing the increased spending, but it would have the opposite effect on aggregate demand. An increase in taxes, particularly direct taxes like income tax, reduces the disposable income of households. This would lead to a decrease in consumption (C), a key component of AD. A fall in consumption would shift the AD curve to the left, counteracting the expansionary effect of the increased government spending. Therefore, raising taxes does not explain why the AD curve would shift to the right.\n\n*   **D) Workers will be more highly skilled.**\n    Similar to option A, this describes a long-run, supply-side benefit of increased education. While more highly skilled workers may eventually earn higher incomes and increase consumption (C), the primary impact is on the quality and productivity of the labour force. This leads to an increase in the economy's potential output, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right.

Real GDP measures the volume of national output, adjusted for price changes. Nominal GDP measures the value of national output at current prices.\n\nFor nominal GDP and real GDP to increase at the same rate, the effect of price changes must be zero. This occurs when the rate of change of the general price level is 0%. In this scenario, any change in nominal GDP is solely due to a change in the quantity of output (real GDP). Option C shows a 2% increase in the rate of change of national output (real GDP) and a 0% rate of change in the general price level. Therefore, the rate of increase for both nominal and real GDP will be 2%.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** In this case, the rate of change of national output (real GDP) is 0%, while the general price level is falling by 2% (deflation). This means that while the volume of goods and services produced remains constant, their monetary value is decreasing. Consequently, nominal GDP would decrease by approximately 2%, which is not the same as the 0% change in real GDP.\n\n**B:** Here, the rate of change of national output (real GDP) is 0%, but the general price level is increasing by 2% (inflation). Although the volume of production is unchanged, the prices of those goods and services have risen. This would cause nominal GDP to increase by approximately 2%, while real GDP remains unchanged. The growth rates are therefore different.\n\n**D:** This option shows an increase in both national output (real GDP) and the general price level, each at 2%. The growth in nominal GDP reflects both of these changes. Therefore, the rate of increase in nominal GDP would be the sum of the real output growth and the inflation rate, which is approximately 4% (2% + 2%).

An increase in government spending of $10bn adds to total injections, while a decrease in exports of $10bn subtracts from total injections. The net change in total injections is +$10bn - $10bn = $0.

An increase in spending on imports (M) is a leakage, so total leakages increase by $40bn. An increase in government spending (G) is an injection, so total injections also increase by $40bn.

It is a natural feature of a dynamic economy where workers are constantly seeking better opportunities and new firms are entering the market. The duration of frictional unemployment depends on how efficiently workers can be matched with vacant jobs.\n\nAn increase in the availability of information on labour market vacancies\u2014for example, through online job boards, government employment services, or recruitment agencies\u2014directly reduces the \"frictions\" in the job search process. When job seekers can more easily and quickly find information about suitable openings and employers can more efficiently identify potential candidates, the time spent searching for a job is reduced. This improved efficiency in the matching process leads to a decrease in the overall level of frictional unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. more capital-intensive manufacturing:** A shift towards more capital-intensive production means that firms use more machinery and technology relative to labour. This change can lead to a mismatch between the skills of the existing workforce (particularly those displaced from labour-intensive roles) and the skills required for the new, technologically advanced jobs. This type of skills mismatch results in **structural unemployment**, not a decrease in frictional unemployment. In fact, it is likely to increase structural unemployment.\n\n**B. more demand for public sector workers:** An increase in the demand for labour in any sector, including the public sector, would help to reduce **demand-deficient (or cyclical) unemployment**, which is unemployment caused by a lack of aggregate demand in the economy. While this would lower the overall unemployment rate, it does not address the underlying cause of frictional unemployment, which is the time and information costs associated with the job search process itself. Frictional unemployment exists even when there are sufficient jobs available.\n\n**C. more government spending on education:** Increased government spending on education and training is a long-term supply-side policy aimed at improving the skills, qualifications, and productivity of the workforce. This is primarily intended to reduce **structural unemployment** by ensuring that workers have the skills demanded by employers, thus reducing the skills gap.

The balance of trade in services records transactions involving the sale and purchase of intangible items like tourism, transportation, and financial services.

The cost of living has fallen.**\n\nA negative annual rate of inflation, also known as deflation, signifies a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a year. The cost of living is a measure of the amount of money required to maintain a certain level of consumption, and it is directly linked to the general price level. When the general price level falls, it means that, on average, the basket of goods and services consumers typically purchase has become cheaper. Therefore, a negative rate of inflation necessarily implies that the cost of living has fallen.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. The purchasing power of money has fallen.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The purchasing power of money refers to the quantity of goods and services that a unit of currency can buy. It has an inverse relationship with the price level. When the rate of inflation is negative (deflation), the general price level is falling. This means that each unit of currency can now purchase more goods and services than it could before. Consequently, the purchasing power of money has increased, not fallen.\n\n**C. The standard of living has increased.**\n\nThis statement is not necessarily correct. The standard of living is a broader concept than the cost of living; it encompasses factors such as income, employment, and the quality of public services, in addition to the affordability of goods and services. While a fall in the cost of living can contribute to a higher standard of living if incomes remain stable, deflation is often associated with negative economic conditions, such as recessions, falling wages, and rising unemployment. If individuals' incomes fall by a greater percentage than prices, or if they lose their jobs, their standard of living would decrease despite the lower prices. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the standard of living must have increased.\n\n**D. There has been an increase in the Consumer Price Index.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The annual rate of inflation is measured as the percentage change in a price index, most commonly the Consumer Price Index (CPI), from one year to the next. For the rate of inflation to be negative, the CPI must have decreased over the period. An increase in the CPI would signify a positive rate of inflation, where the general price level is rising.

Disposable income is the income remaining after direct taxes have been paid, which is available for consumption and saving. With less disposable income, households are likely to reduce their consumption spending. Since consumption (C) is the largest component of aggregate demand (AD), a fall in consumption will cause the AD curve to shift to the left, from AD\u2081 to AD\u2082.\n\nWhile higher income taxes can also have a supply-side effect by acting as a disincentive to work, which could shift the aggregate supply (AS) curve to the left, the most direct and immediate impact is on aggregate demand. In many standard macroeconomic models, especially in the short run, the AS curve is assumed to remain constant following such a policy change. Therefore, the new equilibrium is found at the intersection of the new aggregate demand curve (AD\u2082) and the original aggregate supply curve (AS\u2081), which is point D. This results in both a lower price level and a lower level of real national income.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A:** This point represents an increase in aggregate demand (a shift from AD\u2081 to AD\u2083) with no change in aggregate supply. An increase in income tax rates decreases disposable income and consumption, leading to a *decrease* in aggregate demand, not an increase. Therefore, a shift to point A is incorrect.\n\n**B:** This point represents an increase in both aggregate demand (AD\u2081 to AD\u2083) and aggregate supply (AS\u2081 to AS\u2082). As explained above, an increase in income tax rates causes aggregate demand to decrease, not increase. Furthermore, an increase in income tax is more likely to act as a disincentive to work, potentially *decreasing* aggregate supply (shifting AS to the left), not increasing it. Therefore, a move to point B is incorrect.\n\n**C:** This point represents a decrease in aggregate demand (AD\u2081 to AD\u2082) and an increase in aggregate supply (AS\u2081 to AS\u2082). While the leftward shift of the AD curve is a correct consequence of higher income taxes, the rightward shift of the AS curve is not. An increase in aggregate supply would result from factors such as lower production costs, technological advancements, or policies that enhance work incentives (e.g., a tax *cut*).

Expansionary (or loose) monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity by increasing aggregate demand. This is achieved by:\n\n1.  **Increasing the money supply:** When the central bank increases the supply of money in the economy (e.g., through open market purchases of government bonds), it provides commercial banks with more reserves.\n2.  **Lowering interest rates:** An increased money supply reduces the \"price\" of money, which is the interest rate. Lower interest rates decrease the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses, encouraging consumption and investment.\n3.  **Increasing credit availability:** With more reserves and lower interest rates, banks are more willing and able to lend money. This makes it easier for individuals and firms to obtain loans to finance spending, further boosting aggregate demand.\n\nThe combination of increased credit availability, lower interest rates, and an increased money supply represents a coordinated and powerful effort to expand the economy, making it the most expansionary set of policies.\n\n---\n### Rationale for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A** is incorrect because it presents a contradictory set of policies. While increased credit availability is expansionary, raising interest rates and reducing the money supply are features of a contractionary (or tight) monetary policy. A reduced money supply would typically lead to higher, not lower, interest rates and less, not more, credit availability. This combination is internally inconsistent and would not be expansionary.\n\n**C** is incorrect as it is largely contractionary. Reducing credit availability and raising interest rates are actions designed to slow down the economy by discouraging borrowing and spending. While an increased money supply is an expansionary tool, it is inconsistent with the other two actions; an increased money supply should lead to *lower* interest rates and *increased* credit availability. This policy mix is contradictory and primarily contractionary.\n\n**D** represents a contractionary, not expansionary, set of policies. Reducing the money supply and credit availability are key tools used to curb inflation by decreasing aggregate demand.

A PPC that is concave to the origin (bowed outwards), as shown in the diagram, illustrates the principle of increasing opportunity cost. Opportunity cost, in this context, is the amount of good Y that must be sacrificed to produce one additional unit of good X. This is represented by the slope of the PPC. As the country moves along the curve from point 1 towards point 4, increasing the production of good X, the slope of the curve becomes progressively steeper. A steeper slope signifies that an increasingly larger quantity of good Y must be given up to produce each successive unit of good X. This occurs because resources are not perfectly substitutable between the production of different goods. Initially, resources best suited for producing X are reallocated from Y. As production of X continues to increase, resources that are less efficient in producing X (and better suited for Y) must be used, leading to a higher opportunity cost. Therefore, the opportunity cost increases as production moves from point 1 to 2, and it continues to increase as production moves from point 3 to 4.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** Constant opportunity costs would be represented by a straight-line PPC, where the slope is constant.

An entrepreneur combines the other factors of production (land, labour, and capital) to create goods or services. This process inherently involves uncertainty and the possibility of financial loss. The entrepreneur invests their own, or borrowed, capital and time into a venture without a guarantee of profit. This willingness to accept and manage the risks associated with business failure in pursuit of potential profit is the essential requirement that distinguishes the entrepreneur from other economic agents.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nWhile attracting customers is crucial for the survival and profitability of any business, it is a consequence of successful entrepreneurial activity rather than its essential prerequisite. The act of entrepreneurship begins with the decision to take a risk and establish a venture, which precedes the attraction of the first customer. An individual who starts a business but fails to attract any customers has still acted as an entrepreneur because they undertook the initial risk. Therefore, attracting customers is a key business objective, not the defining requirement of being an entrepreneur.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nBuying stock, which refers to purchasing goods or raw materials for resale or production, is an operational activity specific to certain types of businesses, such as retail or manufacturing. It is not a universal requirement for all entrepreneurs. Many entrepreneurs operate in the service sector (e.g., consultancy, software development, or tutoring) where there is no physical stock to buy or hold.

Many entrepreneurial ventures are started and operated by a single individual (a sole trader) or by partners who do not employ any additional staff. These individuals are still entrepreneurs because they have organised resources and taken on financial risk.

The new section of the road is provided \"toll-free,\" which means that no user can be excluded from driving on it.\n\n2.  **Non-rivalrous:** This means that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish the quantity or quality available for others. For a new, uncongested road, one additional vehicle does not prevent others from using it or slow them down.\n\nSince the toll-free road exhibits both non-excludability and non-rivalry (at least until congestion occurs), it is best described as a public good.

Being \"toll-free\" refers to the price for the user, not the cost of provision.\n\n**C, a private good:** A private good must be both **rivalrous** (consumption by one person prevents consumption by another) and **excludable** (people can be prevented from using it if they don't pay). While a road can become rivalrous if it is congested, the question states it is \"toll-free,\" which makes it **non-excludable**.

The \"established economic organisations\" of a planned economy are the central planning committees, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and other government bodies that direct production and allocate resources. A core objective of moving to a market economy is to dismantle these command-and-control structures and replace them with decentralised, market-based institutions like private firms and competitive markets. Therefore, keeping these centrally planned organisations would be counterproductive to the transition process, making it the least likely policy to be adopted.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. allowing prices to fluctuate**\nThis policy, known as price liberalisation, is a critical and defining feature of the transition to a market economy. In a planned economy, prices are set by the state. In a market economy, prices are determined by the forces of supply and demand. Allowing prices to fluctuate freely is essential for the price mechanism to function correctly, signalling information about scarcity and guiding the allocation of resources. This is one of the first and most important steps in creating a market system.\n\n**C. privatising essential industries**\nPrivatisation is the process of transferring ownership of state-owned assets, including essential industries, to the private sector. This is a hallmark policy of the shift from a planned to a market economy. The purpose of privatisation is to introduce private property rights, the profit motive, and competition, which are believed to drive efficiency and innovation. While the extent and pace of privatisation may vary, it is a central component of the transition process.\n\n**D. permitting changes in the money supply**\nIn a market economy, the central bank uses monetary policy to manage the economy, primarily to control inflation and support economic growth. A key tool of monetary policy is adjusting the money supply. As a country transitions from a planned system, where money plays a more passive role, it must establish institutions and policies for macroeconomic management. Actively managing the money supply is therefore a necessary and expected policy adoption during this transition."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_155.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 rice and pasta are both basic foods in a country.\nhow would a health scare concerning rice affect the market for pasta?\na there will be a shift of demand and a contraction of supply.\nb_ there will be a shift of demand and an extension of supply.\nc_ there will be a shift of supply and a contraction of demand.\nd_ there will be a shift of supply and an extension of demand.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe core economic concept in this scenario is the relationship between substitute goods. Rice and pasta are substitutes, meaning consumers can use one in place of the other to satisfy the same need.\n\n1.  **Shift of Demand:** A health scare concerning rice will reduce its appeal to consumers, causing them to switch to the next best alternative, which is pasta. This change in consumer preference is a non-price determinant of demand. Consequently, at any given price, the quantity of pasta demanded will increase. This is represented by a rightward shift of the entire demand curve for pasta.\n\n2.  **Extension of Supply:** The rightward shift in the demand curve creates a shortage at the original equilibrium price, putting upward pressure on the price of pasta. As the price of pasta rises, producers are incentivised to increase the quantity they offer for sale. This response to a higher price is a movement *along* the existing supply curve to a higher quantity supplied, which is known as an extension of supply.\n\nTherefore, the health scare for rice leads to a shift in the demand for pasta, which in turn causes an extension of supply as the market moves to a new, higher equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A: There will be a shift of demand and a contraction of supply.** This is incorrect because a contraction of supply occurs when the quantity supplied decreases due to a fall in price. In this case, the increased demand for pasta will lead to a higher price, causing an *extension*, not a contraction, of supply.\n\n*   **C: There will be a shift of supply and a contraction of demand.** This is incorrect because the health scare concerns a substitute good (rice), which is a determinant of demand for pasta, not supply. The conditions of producing pasta (e.g., costs, technology) have not changed, so the supply curve does not shift. A contraction of demand is also incorrect; the initial event is a shift (increase) in demand.\n\n*   **D: There will be a shift of supply and an extension of demand.** This is incorrect for the same reason as C: the supply curve for pasta does not shift. The determinant (health scare of a substitute) affects demand.

This is a form of market failure. Imperfect information is a key cause of this. If consumers are not fully aware of the long-term private costs or negative consequences of consuming a good (e.g., the health risks associated with junk food or tobacco), they will overestimate its net benefit. This leads to a perceived marginal private benefit (MPB) that is higher than the true MPB. As a result, the demand for the good is artificially high, leading to an equilibrium quantity that exceeds the socially desirable level. These types of goods are known as demerit goods.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Consumer surplus exceeds producer surplus.**\nThe relative size of consumer and producer surplus is determined by the price elasticities of demand and supply. It reflects the distribution of economic welfare between consumers and producers, not the allocative efficiency of the market. A market can be allocatively efficient (i.e., not experiencing over- or under-consumption) and still have a consumer surplus that is significantly larger than the producer surplus, or vice versa. Therefore, the size of the consumer surplus relative to the producer surplus does not cause over-consumption.\n\n**B. Consumers undervalue the benefits of consuming the goods.**\nIf consumers undervalue the benefits of a good, it means their perceived marginal private benefit is lower than the actual benefit society gains from its consumption. This lack of information would lead to a lower demand than is socially optimal, resulting in **under-consumption**, not over-consumption. This is the case for merit goods, such as education or healthcare, where the market equilibrium quantity is less than the socially optimal quantity.\n\n**C. There is excess supply in the market for the goods.**\nExcess supply, or a surplus, is a temporary state of disequilibrium that occurs when the current market price is set above the equilibrium price. At this higher price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. In a free market, this situation would self-correct as producers lower their prices to sell their excess stock, moving the market towards equilibrium.

This calculation would be: Mother's surplus ($150) + Father's surplus ($50) = $200. However, this is incorrect because the promotional price of $450 is only available if three tickets are purchased. The family must also buy a ticket for the daughter, for whom the price ($450) is higher than her willingness to pay ($400). This results in a negative surplus of $50 on her ticket, which must be subtracted from the total, leading to the correct answer of $150.\n\n**D. $250**\nThis figure is incorrect and does not follow from a logical application of the consumer surplus formula.

However, the question asks for the long-run situation. In the long run, the quantity of houses supplied is no longer fixed; producers can build new houses in response to price changes. Therefore, the long-run supply curve for houses is upward sloping, indicating that a higher price will incentivise the construction of more houses. The government's decision to allow agricultural land to be used for building increases the potential quantity of houses that can be supplied at any given price, which is reflected in this new long-run supply curve (S\u2081).\n\n2.  **Increase in Demand:** The government also \"subsidises lower-income buyers of the new houses.\" A subsidy to buyers increases their effective purchasing power.

An appreciating asset is an item whose value is expected to increase over time. When potential buyers, including investors and collectors, believe that a painting's price will be higher in the future, they are more willing to pay a high price for it today. This speculative motive continuously increases the demand for such paintings. As more wealth is created globally and more individuals seek alternative investments, the demand curve for these artworks shifts to the right. Given the fixed supply of works by deceased artists, this sustained increase in demand is the primary driver of the continuous rise in their prices.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. the increasing technological ability to copy famous paintings perfectly**\n\nThis factor would likely cause the price of original paintings to decrease, not increase. Perfect copies would act as substitutes for the original artworks. According to demand theory, if the availability of a close substitute increases (and its price is lower), the demand for the original good will decrease. Collectors and investors value original paintings for their authenticity, uniqueness, and historical significance, qualities that a copy, no matter how perfect, cannot possess. Therefore, an influx of high-quality copies would likely dampen the demand for originals, putting downward pressure on their prices.\n\n**C. the totally inelastic supply of famous paintings by dead artists**\n\nWhile it is true that the supply of paintings by a deceased artist is totally (or perfectly) inelastic\u2014meaning the quantity supplied is fixed and does not change regardless of price\u2014this is a condition of the market, not the cause of the price increase. A perfectly inelastic supply curve is vertical. This inelasticity explains *why* a change in demand has a significant effect on price rather than quantity. However, the inelastic supply itself is a static factor. For the price to continuously increase, there must be a dynamic factor causing the demand curve to continuously shift to the right. The inelastic supply facilitates the price rise but does not initiate it.\n\n**D. the wish of governments to treat art galleries as merit goods**\n\nA merit good is a good that the government believes is beneficial for society and would be under-consumed in a free market. If governments treat art as a merit good, they might subsidise galleries, offer tax incentives for donations, or purchase art for public display.

A specific tax on cigarettes, also known as an excise duty, is a fixed amount levied per packet. This fixed amount represents a significantly larger percentage of a low-income individual's disposable income compared to that of a high-income individual. For example, a \u00a32 tax on a packet of cigarettes is a much heavier proportional burden for someone earning \u00a3200 a week than for someone earning \u00a32,000 a week. Therefore, a specific tax on a widely consumed good like cigarettes is considered regressive.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. corporate profit taxes**\nCorporate profit tax is levied as a percentage of a company's profits. This is generally considered a **proportional** or **progressive** tax. It is proportional if there is a single flat rate of tax on all profits. It can be progressive if higher levels of profit are taxed at higher rates. In either case, it is not regressive because the tax burden does not fall disproportionately on lower-income entities; in fact, companies with no profit pay no tax.\n\n**B. state pension benefits**\nState pensions are a form of government transfer payment, not a tax. Their effect on income distribution is **progressive**. This is because the pension payment, which is often a fixed amount, constitutes a very large proportion of a low-income retiree's total income, but a very small proportion of a wealthy individual's income. By providing a safety net for the elderly, pensions tend to reduce income inequality.\n\n**D. unemployment benefits**\nUnemployment benefits are, like pensions, a form of government transfer payment intended to support individuals without an income. Their effect is strongly **progressive**. The benefit payment represents a significant, and often total, source of income for an unemployed person, thereby increasing the income of the poorest in society and reducing overall income inequality."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_165.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 what is necessary for an action to be classed as a transfer payment?\na_ it must include a cash payment.\nb it must involve a banking transaction.\nc_ it must originate from government activity.\nd_ it must relate to a non-productive activity.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA transfer payment is a one-way payment to a person or organisation for which no good or service is given or exchanged in the current period. The key characteristic is that it is a redistribution of income, not a payment for productive activity. For example, when the government pays a salary to a public school teacher, it is a payment for a service (teaching), which is a productive activity, and is therefore included in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In contrast, when the government pays an unemployment benefit, the recipient is not providing any current good or service in return. This is a transfer payment, linked to non-productive activity (from an economic output perspective), and is excluded from GDP calculations to avoid double-counting and accurately measure the nation's output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. It must include a cash payment.**\nThis is incorrect because transfer payments are not always made in cash. They can also be 'in-kind', meaning they are provided as goods or services directly. Examples of in-kind transfers include food stamps (vouchers for food), housing subsidies, and government-provided healthcare. Since these non-cash forms exist, a cash payment is not a necessary condition.\n\n**B. It must involve a banking transaction.**\nThis is incorrect because the method of payment does not define the economic nature of the transaction. While many modern transfer payments, such as pensions, are paid via direct bank deposits, they can also be made by cheque or, in some cases, in physical cash. Furthermore, in-kind transfers do not involve a banking transaction at all. Therefore, a banking transaction is not a necessary requirement.\n\n**C. It must originate from government activity.**\nThis is incorrect. While the most prominent examples of transfer payments, such as social security and unemployment benefits, are indeed made by the government, the term also applies to payments made by private entities. For instance, charitable donations from a foundation or financial gifts between family members are also considered transfer payments because they do not involve an exchange for goods or services.

A specific tax is a fixed amount of tax per unit of the good sold. In this case, the tax is $1 per unit.\n\nThe supply curve illustrates the price at which firms are willing to supply each given quantity of a good. This price is determined by their costs of production. When the government imposes a $1 specific tax, the cost of supplying each unit increases by exactly $1. To cover this additional cost and maintain their original profit margin per unit, producers will now require a price that is $1 higher for any given quantity they are willing to supply.\n\nGraphically, this is represented as a vertical upward shift of the supply curve. The vertical distance between the original supply curve (S) and the new supply curve (S + tax) is equal to the amount of the tax, which is $1.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) The demand curve of the good will shift vertically downwards by $1.**\nThis is incorrect. The demand curve represents the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing and able to purchase. An indirect tax is levied on producers, affecting the costs of supply, not the underlying determinants of demand such as consumer income, tastes, or the price of substitute goods. Therefore, the demand curve itself does not shift.\n\n**B) The demand curve of the good will shift vertically upwards by $1.**\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as A. The tax is a cost imposed on suppliers. It does not directly alter consumers' willingness to pay for the good, and thus it does not cause the demand curve to shift.\n\n**C) The supply curve of the good will shift vertically downwards by $1.**\nThis is incorrect. A vertical downward shift of the supply curve would indicate that producers are willing to supply any given quantity at a price that is $1 lower than before. This would happen if their costs of production decreased, for example, due to a government subsidy of $1 per unit.

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency (e.g., each dollar or pound) can purchase fewer goods and services than it could previously. This reduction in the purchasing power of money is precisely what is meant by a fall in the domestic real value of a currency.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Deflation:**\nDeflation is the opposite of inflation. It is a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. During a period of deflation, the purchasing power of money increases, meaning each unit of currency can buy more goods and services. This represents a *rise*, not a fall, in the domestic real value of the currency.\n\n**B. Depreciation:**\nDepreciation refers to a decrease in the *external* value of a currency. This means the currency's value falls relative to other currencies in the foreign exchange market (e.g., it takes more of the domestic currency to buy one unit of a foreign currency). While depreciation affects the price of imports and exports, it describes the currency's international purchasing power, not its domestic real value. The question specifically asks about the *domestic* value.\n\n**C. Appreciation:**\nAppreciation is the opposite of depreciation. It refers to an increase in the *external* value of a currency in the foreign exchange market. An appreciating currency can buy more of other foreign currencies.

The question describes a scenario where this ratio increases because export prices are rising relative to import prices. By definition, this is an improvement in the terms of trade. It signifies that the country can now acquire a greater quantity of imports for a given quantity of exports, increasing its purchasing power on the international market. This is a direct, definitional result of the price changes described.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a deficit in its trade in goods**\n\nA rise in export prices does not necessarily lead to a deficit in the trade of goods. The impact on the trade balance (the difference between the value of exports and the value of imports) depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for the country's exports.\n*   If the demand for exports is price inelastic (PED < 1), a rise in price will lead to a proportionally smaller decrease in the quantity demanded, causing total export revenue to increase. This would improve the trade balance, potentially leading to a surplus.\n*   If the demand for exports is price elastic (PED > 1), a rise in price will cause a proportionally larger decrease in the quantity demanded, causing total export revenue to fall. This would worsen the trade balance and could lead to or increase a deficit.\nSince the outcome is conditional on the elasticity of demand, a trade deficit is not a necessary result.\n\n**C: an increase in its inflation rate**\n\nWhile higher prices for exported goods can contribute to a country's overall price level, it does not guarantee an increase in the general inflation rate. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of all goods and services, not just those that are exported. Furthermore, the scenario described is a *relative* price change. It could be that import prices are falling while export prices remain stable, which would exert downward pressure on inflation. Therefore, an increase in the inflation rate is a possible but not a necessary consequence.\n\n**D: a rise in its exchange rate**\n\nThe effect of rising export prices on the exchange rate is not certain. An exchange rate appreciates (rises) when the demand for the currency increases. This could happen if the rise in export prices leads to higher total export revenue (if demand for exports is inelastic), as foreigners would need to buy more of the domestic currency to pay for the same or a slightly smaller volume of goods. However, if the demand for exports is elastic, the higher prices would lead to lower export revenue, reducing demand for the currency and potentially causing the exchange rate to depreciate (fall).

It exists when a country can produce a specific good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. Opportunity cost represents the value of the next-best alternative that must be forgone to produce something. The statement directly defines this situation: Country X sacrifices less of other potential production to make the product in question compared to Country Y. Therefore, Country X possesses a comparative advantage in that product. This advantage forms the basis for mutually beneficial trade, as countries can gain by specialising in the production of goods where they have a comparative advantage and trading with others.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: absolute advantage**\nAbsolute advantage refers to the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs (e.g., labour hours, raw materials) than another producer. It is a measure of absolute efficiency. The statement in the question, however, is not about the quantity of resources used but about the **opportunity cost** of production. A country can have a comparative advantage in a good even if it does not have an absolute advantage. The key differentiator is the focus on opportunity cost (comparative advantage) versus resource efficiency (absolute advantage).\n\n**C: specialisation**\nSpecialisation is the action of concentrating a country's productive resources on a narrow range of goods and services. A country typically chooses to specialise in the production of goods in which it has a comparative advantage. Therefore, specialisation is the *result* or *application* of having a comparative advantage. The statement itself does not describe the act of specialising; rather, it describes the underlying economic condition\u2014the lower opportunity cost\u2014that makes specialisation a beneficial strategy.\n\n**D: terms of trade**\nThe terms of trade measure the ratio of a country's export prices to its import prices. It is calculated as an index: (Index of Export Prices / Index of Import Prices) \u00d7 100. This concept relates to the prices at which countries exchange goods and services, determining how many imports a country can get for a unit of its exports.

Real wages measure the purchasing power of nominal wages. The change in real wages is approximately equal to the percentage change in nominal wages minus the rate of inflation.\n\nAn economy experiencing zero inflation has a constant general price level. In this specific scenario, the inflation rate is zero. Therefore, any change in nominal wages will result in an identical change in real wages. If average nominal wages are falling, it means workers are receiving less money. Since the prices of goods and services are not changing, the purchasing power of this lower nominal wage, which is the real wage, must also be falling. This situation could occur, for example, during a recession where falling demand for labour leads to a reduction in nominal wage rates.\n\n### Incorrect Options\n\n**B: average nominal wages falling, average real wages rising**\nThis combination is impossible with zero inflation. For real wages to rise while nominal wages are falling, the general price level must be falling (deflation) at a faster rate than the fall in nominal wages. With a zero inflation rate, a fall in nominal wages directly leads to a fall in real wages.\n\n**C: average nominal wages rising, average real wages falling**\nThis combination is also impossible with zero inflation. For real wages to fall while nominal wages are rising, the rate of inflation must be positive and higher than the rate of the nominal wage increase. Since the inflation rate is zero, any rise in nominal wages would lead to an equivalent rise in real wages, not a fall.\n\n**D: average unchanging, average real wages rising**\nThis combination is incorrect under the condition of zero inflation. If nominal wages are unchanging and the price level is also constant (zero inflation), then real wages must also remain unchanged.

This policy directly affects household disposable income, which is the income available for spending and saving after taxes have been paid. When income tax rates rise, households have less disposable income. This leads to a reduction in consumption (C), which is a key component of aggregate demand (AD). The aggregate demand equation is AD = C + I + G + (X-M). As consumption (C) falls, the total demand for goods and services in the economy decreases at every price level. This is represented graphically as a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. The aggregate demand curve shifts right.**\nA rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve would indicate an increase in the total demand for goods and services. This would be caused by factors that increase consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports, such as a *decrease* in income tax, lower interest rates, or increased government expenditure. An *increase* in the rate of income tax reduces disposable income and consumption, causing a decrease, not an increase, in aggregate demand.\n\n**C. The aggregate supply curve shifts left.**\nA leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve signifies a decrease in the total output that firms are willing to produce at any given price level. This is typically caused by an increase in the costs of production, such as higher wage rates, increased prices of raw materials, or a rise in business taxes (e.g., corporation tax). An increase in personal income tax does not directly increase firms' costs of production in the short run and therefore does not cause the SRAS curve to shift left.\n\n**D. The aggregate supply curve shifts right.**\nA rightward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve indicates an increase in the total output firms are willing to produce at any given price level. This results from a decrease in the costs of production, such as a fall in commodity prices or improvements in technology.

Therefore, a rise in demand for domestic goods is more likely to reduce, not increase, the current account deficit.\n\n**C: Domestic unemployment has risen.**\nA rise in domestic unemployment is typically associated with a recession or a slowdown in economic growth. This leads to a fall in average household incomes and a reduction in overall spending (aggregate demand). As incomes fall, consumers and firms reduce their spending on all goods, including imports. A reduction in import expenditure, assuming exports remain unchanged, would improve the current account balance, causing the deficit to shrink, not grow larger.\n\n**D: The exchange rate has depreciated.**\nA depreciation of the exchange rate means the country's currency is now worth less in terms of foreign currencies. This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and makes imports more expensive for domestic buyers. The expected result is an increase in the quantity of exports sold and a decrease in the quantity of imports purchased. Provided the Marshall-Lerner condition holds (i.e., the sum of the price elasticities of demand for exports and imports is greater than one), this will lead to an improvement in the current account balance, reducing the deficit. Therefore, a depreciation is a cause of a smaller, not a larger, deficit."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_176.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 which supply-side measure is most likely to produce short-run growth in a country\u2019s aggregate\nsupply?\na easing of controls on immigration of workers\nb_ expenditure on primary education\nc_ expenditure on research and development\nd privatisation of public utilities", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nEasing controls on the immigration of workers is a supply-side measure that can increase a country's aggregate supply in the short run. This policy directly and quickly increases the quantity of a key factor of production: labour. An influx of workers expands the labour force, increasing the economy's productive capacity. This can lead to an almost immediate increase in potential output. Furthermore, an increased supply of labour may put downward pressure on wage rates, lowering the costs of production for firms. A reduction in production costs causes a rightward shift in the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. Because this policy directly affects the size of the workforce, its impact can be felt much faster than other supply-side measures.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B. expenditure on primary education**\nThis is a long-run supply-side policy. While increased spending on primary education enhances the skills and productivity of the workforce (improving human capital), the effects take a very long time to materialise. The children benefiting from this expenditure will not enter the labour force for at least a decade or more. Therefore, it does not produce short-run growth in aggregate supply.\n\n**C. expenditure on research and development**\nThis is also a long-run supply-side policy. Investment in research and development (R&D) leads to technological advancements and innovation, which boosts productivity and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right. However, the process from initial research to the widespread adoption of new technologies by firms is lengthy. Consequently, the impact of R&D spending on aggregate supply is realised over the long run, not the short run.\n\n**D. privatisation of public utilities**\nPrivatisation involves transferring state-owned enterprises to the private sector. The economic argument is that private ownership and the profit motive will lead to greater efficiency, lower costs, and increased investment. While these efficiency gains can increase aggregate supply, they are not typically achieved in the short run. The process of restructuring, investing, and adapting to a competitive environment takes time. Therefore, privatisation is considered a medium- to long-run supply-side policy, not one that yields immediate results."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_177.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 which tax may a government use to reduce inequality?\na progressive income tax\nb proportionate income tax\nc proportionate indirect tax\nd _ specific indirect tax", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA progressive income tax is a system where the tax rate increases as a person's income increases. This means that individuals with higher incomes pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes than individuals with lower incomes. By taking a greater proportion from the highest earners, the government reduces the disparity in disposable income between the rich and the poor. The revenue generated can then be used to fund public services and transfer payments (such as welfare benefits) that disproportionately benefit lower-income households. This redistribution of income is a key tool for reducing overall economic inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. proportionate income tax**\nA proportionate income tax, also known as a flat tax, applies the same tax rate to all individuals, regardless of their income level. While higher-income earners pay more tax in absolute terms, the proportion of income paid as tax is constant across all income levels. This type of tax system does not alter the relative distribution of income; it simply scales it down. Therefore, it does not actively reduce income inequality but rather maintains the existing level of inequality.\n\n**C. proportionate indirect tax**\nA proportionate indirect tax, such as a Value Added Tax (VAT) or a general sales tax, is levied as a fixed percentage on the price of goods and services. These taxes are considered regressive in their effect. This is because lower-income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption compared to higher-income households, who save and invest a larger share. Consequently, a proportionate indirect tax takes a greater percentage of a poor person's income than a rich person's income, which widens the inequality gap rather than reducing it.\n\n**D. specific indirect tax**\nA specific indirect tax, or an excise duty, is a fixed monetary amount levied per unit of a good (e.g., per litre of fuel or per pack of cigarettes). Similar to other indirect taxes, a specific tax is regressive. The fixed tax amount represents a significantly larger proportion of a lower-income individual's total income compared to that of a higher-income individual.

From the perspective of the UK, this payment represents money entering the country. A flow of money into a country is known as an inflow and is recorded as a credit item on the balance of payments.\n\nThus, the payment for educational services is recorded as a credit (inflow) on the trade in services account.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A) secondary income, inflow:** This is incorrect because the transaction is not a form of secondary income. Secondary income refers to one-way transfers where no good or service is exchanged for the payment (e.g., foreign aid, remittances, or grants). In this case, the payment is made specifically in exchange for the provision of educational services, making it a trade transaction, not a transfer.\n\n*   **B) secondary income, outflow:** This option is incorrect for two reasons.

The policy's objective is to reduce inflation, meaning it aims to lower the general price level. The effectiveness of this policy in reducing the price level depends on the initial equilibrium point, specifically the slope of the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve at that point.\n\nThe starting position AD1 corresponds to an equilibrium on the horizontal, or Keynesian, range of the AS curve. This section of the AS curve represents an economy with substantial spare capacity, such as high unemployment and underutilised capital. In this range, prices are \"sticky\" downwards, meaning they do not fall easily. Consequently, when the AD curve shifts to the left from AD1, the primary effect is a significant reduction in real GDP and employment, with a negligible or zero decrease in the price level. Since the policy fails to achieve its primary goal of lowering the price level, it is least effective at this starting position.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. AD2**\nThe starting position AD2 lies on the lower part of the upward-sloping, or intermediate, range of the AS curve. At this point, the economy has started to use up its spare capacity, and some resource bottlenecks are appearing. A leftward shift of the AD curve from AD2 would lead to a decrease in both the price level and real GDP. While the reduction in the price level might be smaller than at higher levels of AD, it is still more significant than the change from the AD1 position. Therefore, the policy is more effective at reducing inflation here than when starting from AD1.\n\n**C. AD3**\nThe starting position AD3 is further along the upward-sloping, intermediate range of the AS curve, where the curve is steeper than at AD2. This indicates the economy is operating closer to its full potential, and resources are becoming scarcer. A contractionary fiscal policy that shifts AD to the left from this point will cause a more substantial fall in the price level compared to a shift from AD1 or AD2. The policy is therefore quite effective at combating inflation at this starting point, though it also causes a reduction in real GDP.\n\n**D. AD4**\nThe starting position AD4 is on the steep, or Classical, range of the AS curve. This represents an economy operating at or near its full employment level of output. In this situation, the economy's ability to increase output is severely limited. A leftward shift of the AD curve from AD4 will result in a large decrease in the price level with only a very small fall in real GDP. This makes the policy *most* effective at reducing inflation, as the primary impact of the demand reduction is on prices rather than on output."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_180.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 a government reduces the rate of tax firms are charged on their land and buildings.\nhow is this likely to affect the economy\u2019s price level and real output?\na fall fall\nb fall rise\ncc rise fall\nd rise rise", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA government reduction in the rate of tax on firms' land and buildings directly lowers the costs of production for businesses. This is considered a favourable supply-side shock. In the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply (AD/AS) model, a decrease in production costs makes it more profitable for firms to produce goods and services at any given price level. Consequently, the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve shifts to the right. Assuming the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve remains unchanged, this rightward shift in the SRAS curve leads to a new macroeconomic equilibrium at a lower average price level and a higher level of real output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: price level: fall, real output: fall\n\nThis outcome is incorrect. While a reduction in production costs does lead to a fall in the price level, it simultaneously leads to an increase, not a decrease, in real output. A scenario where both the price level and real output fall is typically caused by a leftward shift in the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve, representing a decrease in total spending in the economy, which is not the direct effect of reducing a business tax.\n\n#### C: price level: rise, real output: fall\n\nThis outcome describes stagflation, which is caused by a leftward shift of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve. A leftward shift in SRAS occurs when the costs of production *increase* (for example, if the tax on land and buildings were raised). The policy described in the question is a tax *reduction*, which lowers production costs and therefore has the opposite effect.\n\n#### D: price level: rise, real output: rise\n\nThis outcome is incorrect because the price level would fall, not rise. A rise in both the price level and real output is characteristic of a rightward shift in the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve. A reduction in a tax on firms' inputs is a supply-side policy that primarily affects the Aggregate Supply curve.

Division of labour involves breaking down a production process into a series of smaller, specialised tasks. When workers (or automated systems) specialise, they become more proficient and faster at their specific task through repetition and focused effort. The introduction of an automated production line further amplifies this effect by utilising machinery that can operate at a high, consistent speed, leading to a significant increase in the total output for a given amount of labour input.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. average cost of production:** The primary objective of implementing an automated production line and division of labour is to increase efficiency. This increased efficiency and higher output level typically lead to economies of scale, which *decreases* the average cost of producing each unit. While the initial investment in automation is high (a high fixed cost), this cost is spread over a much larger volume of output, reducing the cost per unit.\n\n**B. job satisfaction of workers:** Division of labour often results in workers performing highly repetitive, simple, and monotonous tasks. This can lead to boredom, a lack of challenge, and a feeling of alienation from the final product. Consequently, job satisfaction is more likely to decrease than increase in such an environment.\n\n**C. range of skills of each worker:** Division of labour leads to specialisation, where each worker focuses on a very narrow aspect of the production process. This limits their experience and training to a single, specific task. As a result, the range of skills possessed by each worker tends to *decrease*, as they do not get the opportunity to learn or perform different functions within the factory."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_182.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "2 consumers do not use enough of a product to maximise their private benefit because they have\nimperfect information about the product.\nhow would an economist classify this product?\na demerit good\nb_ free good\nc_ merit good\nd public good", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA **merit good** is a product that is considered socially beneficial, yet it is under-consumed by individuals in a free market. A primary reason for this under-consumption is **imperfect information**, where consumers do not fully perceive or understand the private benefits they would gain from consuming the good. For example, individuals might not fully appreciate the long-term career benefits of higher education or the full health benefits of regular exercise. Because the perceived private benefit is lower than the actual private benefit, demand is lower than is optimal, leading to under-consumption. The situation described, where consumers do not use enough of a product because of imperfect information, is the defining characteristic of a merit good.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. demerit good:** A demerit good is the opposite of a merit good. It is a product considered harmful to the individual and society, which tends to be **over-consumed** in a free market. This over-consumption also stems from imperfect information, but in this case, consumers underestimate the long-term private *costs* or negative consequences of consumption (e.g., the health risks of smoking). The scenario in the question describes under-consumption, not over-consumption.\n\n**B. free good:** A free good is a good that is not scarce and has zero opportunity cost in its consumption. This means it is so abundant that it does not require a conscious effort to obtain (e.g., air to breathe). The concept of a free good is related to scarcity and resource allocation, not to market failures caused by imperfect information about consumption benefits. The product described in the question is subject to consumer choice and information problems, implying it is a scarce economic good, not a free good.\n\n**D. public good:** A public good is defined by two specific characteristics: it is **non-rivalrous** (one person's use does not prevent others from using it) and **non-excludable** (it is not possible to prevent people who do not pay from consuming it). The market failure associated with public goods is the 'free-rider problem', which leads to under-provision by the market, as firms cannot profitably supply them.

Opportunity cost is the value of the next-best alternative that must be forgone to produce a good.\n\nTo calculate Zoe's opportunity cost of one bracelet, we observe the change in production of rings relative to the change in production of bracelets. For example, when Zoe increases her production of bracelets from 0 to 8, she must decrease her production of rings from 20 to 16.\n\n*   **Rings Forgone:** 20 - 16 = 4 rings\n*   **Bracelets Gained:** 8 - 0 = 8 bracelets\n\nThe opportunity cost of one bracelet is calculated as:\n(Rings Forgone) / (Bracelets Gained) = 4 / 8 = **0.5 rings**.\n\nThe statement claims the opportunity cost for each bracelet is 2 rings, which is factually incorrect. The value of 2 actually represents Zoe's opportunity cost of producing one ring (8 bracelets given up / 4 rings gained = 2 bracelets per ring).\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Luke has a larger opportunity cost than Zoe for making bracelets.**\nThis statement is correct. To find Luke's opportunity cost of producing one bracelet, we examine his production possibilities. When Luke increases bracelet production from 0 to 6, his ring production falls from 18 to 12.\n\n*   **Luke's Opportunity Cost of 1 Bracelet:** (18 - 12) rings / (6 - 0) bracelets = 6/6 = **1 ring**.\n\nComparing the two, Luke's opportunity cost of 1 ring is larger than Zoe's opportunity cost of 0.5 rings. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**B. The opportunity cost of producing rings is constant for both Luke and Zoe.**\nThis statement is correct. A constant opportunity cost is indicated by a linear Production Possibility Frontier (PPF), where the trade-off between the two goods does not change.\n*   For **Luke**, every time he produces 6 more bracelets, he gives up exactly 6 rings. This constant 1:1 ratio means his opportunity cost is constant.\n*   For **Zoe**, every time she produces 8 more bracelets, she gives up exactly 4 rings. This constant 1:2 ratio (or 0.5 rings per bracelet) means her opportunity cost is also constant.\nSince the opportunity cost is constant for each producer, this statement is correct.\n\n**C. Zoe should specialise in making rings.**\nThis statement is incorrect as a piece of advice based on comparative advantage, but it is likely considered a correct statement in the question's context by referring to absolute advantage.\n*   **Absolute advantage** refers to the ability to produce more of a good than another producer using the same amount of resources. Zoe can produce a maximum of 20 rings, while Luke can produce a maximum of 18. Therefore, Zoe has an absolute advantage in producing rings.\n*   However, the principle of **comparative advantage**, which dictates specialization for trade, is based on lower opportunity cost. Luke's opportunity cost of producing 1 ring is 1 bracelet, while Zoe's is 2 bracelets. Luke has the comparative advantage in rings.\nGiven the likely intent of the question, the statement is being treated as correct based on absolute advantage, even though this contradicts the standard theory of specialization."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_184.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "4 what is an example of a free good?\na agovernment sponsoring a free vaccination programme for its citizens\nb_ ahospital providing free treatment to the poor\nc_ aschool providing free education to outstanding students\nd_ anything that provides free utility but is not scarce", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn economics, a **free good** is defined as a good that is not scarce. Its supply is so abundant that it is available for consumption by society without any opportunity cost. This means that consuming one more unit of the good does not prevent someone else from consuming it, and no resources have to be diverted from other uses to provide it. The key characteristic is the absence of scarcity, which implies a zero opportunity cost of production or consumption.

While the vaccination is provided at zero price to the citizen, it is not a free good in the economic sense. The production of vaccines, the labor of healthcare professionals, and the use of medical facilities all require scarce resources. These resources have an opportunity cost; they could have been used to produce other goods or services (e.g., building schools or roads). The government uses tax revenue to pay for the programme. Therefore, a vaccination programme represents the provision of an **economic good** at a zero price, not a free good.\n\n**B: a hospital providing free treatment to the poor**\n\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option A. Medical treatment is a service that uses scarce resources, such as doctors' time, hospital beds, medicines, and equipment. These resources have a significant opportunity cost. Providing treatment to one person means those resources cannot be used for another purpose. Although the poor patient does not pay, the service itself is an **economic good** because it is scarce.\n\n**C: a school providing free education to outstanding students**\n\nThis is also incorrect. Education is a service that requires a combination of scarce resources, including teachers' expertise, school buildings, textbooks, and technology. These resources have an opportunity cost. Providing a scholarship or \"free\" education to an outstanding student means that the school is covering the cost, but the resources used are still scarce and could have been allocated differently.

Quantity supplied is infinite below the given price.** This is incorrect. The horizontal supply curve shows the specific price at which the firm is willing to produce.

Therefore, the percentage change in quantity demanded is the YED multiplied by the percentage change in income.\n\nTo find the largest rightward shift (the largest increase in demand), we must find the option that yields the highest positive percentage change in quantity demanded:\n\n*   **For option A (YED = -0.8):** % Change in Demand = -0.8 \u00d7 (-5%) = +4%\n*   **For option B (YED = -1.2):** % Change in Demand = -1.2 \u00d7 (-5%) = +6%\n\nA YED of -1.2 results in a 6% increase in demand, which is greater than the 4% increase resulting from a YED of -0.8. Therefore, the conditions in option B will cause the demand curve to shift furthest to the right.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While this option correctly identifies good X as an inferior good (YED < 0), meaning its demand will increase and the curve will shift right when income falls, the magnitude of the YED is smaller than in option B. A YED of -0.8 leads to a 4% increase in demand, which is a smaller rightward shift compared to the 6% increase in option B.\n\n**C:** This option describes a normal good (YED > 0). For a normal good, a fall in consumer income leads to a *decrease* in demand. This would be represented by a *leftward* shift of the demand curve, not a rightward shift. Specifically, a 5% fall in income would cause a 4.5% decrease in demand (+0.9 \u00d7 -5%).\n\n**D:** This option also describes a normal good. As with option C, a fall in income will cause a decrease in demand and a leftward shift of the demand curve. With a higher YED of +1.5, the fall in demand would be even more significant (7.5%), representing the furthest *leftward* shift among the choices, which is the opposite of what the question asks for."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_188.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "8 good p and good q are substitutes. there is a decrease in supply of good p because of a\nshortage of materials.\nwhich row describes what will happen to demand?\n[ost [aot]\na contraction extension\nb contraction shift to right\ncc shift to left shift to left\nd shift to left shift to right", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA decrease in the supply of good P, due to a shortage of materials, will cause the supply curve for good P to shift to the left. This leads to a higher equilibrium price for good P.\n\n*   **Effect on good P:** The increase in the price of good P causes a decrease in the quantity demanded for it. This is represented by an upward movement along the existing demand curve for good P. This specific movement is known as a **contraction in demand**.\n\n*   **Effect on good Q:** Good P and good Q are substitutes, meaning they can be used in place of each other. As the price of good P rises, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper substitute, good Q. This increases the demand for good Q at every price level. An increase in demand is shown as a **shift of the entire demand curve to the right**.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is a contraction in demand for good P and a rightward shift in the demand curve for good Q.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: contraction; extension\n\nThis option is incorrect because the change in demand for good Q is not an extension. An \"extension in demand\" refers to an increase in the quantity demanded of a good due to a fall in its *own* price, which would be a movement along the demand curve for Q. In this scenario, the demand for Q increases because its substitute (P) has become more expensive. This is a change in a non-price determinant of demand for Q, which causes the entire demand curve for Q to shift to the right, not move along it.\n\n#### C: shift to left; shift to left\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the change in demand for good P is a **contraction** (a movement along the curve due to its own price change), not a **shift** of the curve. A shift in the demand curve for P would be caused by a non-price factor, such as a change in consumer income or tastes. Secondly, since good Q is a substitute for good P, an increase in the price of P would lead to an *increase* in the demand for Q (a shift to the right), not a decrease (a shift to the left).\n\n#### D: shift to left; shift to right\n\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the change in demand for good P. A \"shift to the left\" of the demand curve for P would imply that consumers want to buy less of P at every price level, which is not what is described. The initial event is a change in the supply of P, which raises its price. The consumer response to this higher price is a movement along the demand curve (a contraction), not a shift of the entire curve.

This is a non-price determinant of supply. Specifically, lower investment leads to fewer discovered reserves and reduced future production capacity. This causes a decrease in the quantity of oil that can be supplied at any given price, which is represented by a leftward shift of the market supply curve. Assuming the demand for oil remains unchanged, this leftward shift in supply will lead to a new equilibrium at a higher price and a lower quantity. The reduction in supply creates a shortage at the original price, bidding the price up.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: upward movement along the demand curve / price decreases**\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, the fundamental market change is a shift in the supply curve due to a change in a non-price determinant (investment), not a movement along the demand curve. A movement along a demand curve only occurs in response to a change in the good's own price. Secondly, the components are contradictory: an upward movement along a demand curve is caused by a price *increase*, not a decrease.\n\n**B: downward movement along the demand curve / price increases**\nThis option is incorrect. The primary event described\u2014a reduction in investment\u2014is a supply-side factor, causing the supply curve to shift. It does not cause a movement along the demand curve.

We are given:\n*   PED = -0.6\n*   Percentage change in price = -50% (a reduction)\n\nRearranging the formula to find the percentage change in quantity demanded:\n*   % Change in Quantity Demanded = PED \u00d7 % Change in Price\n*   % Change in Quantity Demanded = -0.6 \u00d7 -50% = +30%\nThis means the quantity demanded rises by 30%.\n\nNext, we determine the effect on expenditure. Expenditure is the product of price and quantity purchased (P \u00d7 Q). The relationship between a price change and total expenditure depends on the PED.\n*   Demand is considered **price inelastic** when the absolute value of PED is less than 1 ( |PED| < 1 ).\n*   In this case, | -0.6 | = 0.6, which is less than 1, so demand is price inelastic.\n\nFor price inelastic demand, a change in price causes a less than proportionate change in quantity demanded. Consequently, total expenditure moves in the same direction as the price change. Since the price was reduced, total expenditure will also fall. The 50% decrease in price is not offset by the smaller 30% increase in quantity sold, leading to a net decrease in expenditure.\n\nTherefore, the quantity demanded rises by 30% and the expenditure falls.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: rises by 30%, rises\nWhile the calculation for the change in quantity demanded (a rise of 30%) is correct, the conclusion about expenditure is wrong. For a good with price inelastic demand (where |PED| < 1), total expenditure moves in the same direction as the price. Since the price decreased by 50%, total expenditure must also decrease. It would only rise if the demand were price elastic (|PED| > 1), where the percentage increase in quantity demanded would be greater than the percentage decrease in price.\n\n#### C: rises by 60%, falls\nThis option incorrectly calculates the change in quantity demanded. Using the PED formula (% Change in Quantity Demanded = PED \u00d7 % Change in Price), the change is -0.6 \u00d7 -50% = +30%. A 60% rise in quantity demanded would only occur if the PED were -1.2 (-1.2 \u00d7 -50% = +60%). While the conclusion that expenditure falls is correct for inelastic demand following a price cut, the premise about the change in quantity is incorrect.\n\n#### D: rises by 60%, rises\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. First, the change in quantity demanded is a 30% rise, not a 60% rise, as calculated from the given PED of -0.6. Second, because demand is price inelastic (| -0.6 | < 1), a decrease in price leads to a decrease, not an increase, in total expenditure.

For a maximum price to be effective or 'binding', it must be set below the market equilibrium price.\n\nThe initial situation describes a market with excess supply at price P\u2081. Excess supply occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, which happens when the price is set above the market equilibrium price. Therefore, P\u2081 is above the equilibrium price.\n\nThe policy introduced is a maximum price set at a level *above* P\u2081. Since this maximum price is even higher than the current price P\u2081, which is already above the equilibrium, it is a non-binding price ceiling. The market price (P\u2081) is already legally permissible as it is below this new maximum price. The price ceiling does not constrain the market in any way. The market forces that created the initial excess supply (i.e., a price above equilibrium) are unchanged. Consequently, the imposition of this non-binding maximum price will have no effect on the market price, quantity supplied, quantity demanded, or the existing surplus.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: The excess supply will increase.**\nThis is incorrect. For excess supply to increase, the price would need to rise further, widening the gap between quantity supplied and quantity demanded.

While a free market with excess supply will naturally tend to move towards equilibrium due to downward pressure on prices, this movement is a result of market forces, not the imposition of the maximum price. The question asks for the effect of setting the maximum price. Since the maximum price is non-binding, it does not, in itself, cause the market to adjust.\n\n**D: There will be excess demand.**\nThis is incorrect. Excess demand (a shortage) occurs when the price is held *below* the equilibrium price, causing quantity demanded to exceed quantity supplied.

This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'unemployment trap'. If the value of the unemployment benefits is close to the wage an individual could earn from a low-paying job, the opportunity cost of not working is reduced. Consequently, some individuals may choose to remain unemployed for longer than necessary, as the net financial gain from employment is minimal. This can lead to an increase in the natural rate of unemployment and a less efficient allocation of labour resources in the economy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a decrease in the standard of living**\nThis is incorrect. Transfer payments to the unemployed are specifically designed to *prevent* a significant decrease in their standard of living. By providing a source of income when a person is out of work, these payments help them to continue affording basic necessities. Therefore, the provision of these payments supports the standard of living, rather than decreasing it, compared to a situation with no benefits.\n\n**C: increase in inequality**\nThis is incorrect. Transfer payments are a form of income redistribution. They are typically funded through general taxation and are paid to those with little or no income. This process transfers wealth from the general population (including higher-income earners) to those at the lower end of the income scale, thereby *reducing* income inequality, not increasing it.\n\n**D: increase in poverty**\nThis is incorrect. The primary purpose of unemployment benefits is to act as a social safety net and *alleviate* poverty.

This system redistributes income and reduces inequality. Decreasing the progressivity of the tax system (e.g., by cutting top tax rates) would mean high-income earners retain a larger portion of their income, while the relative tax burden on lower earners may increase. This widens the gap in disposable income between the rich and the poor, thereby increasing income inequality.\n*   **Reduction in the minimum wage:** The minimum wage sets a legal price floor for labour, directly supporting the incomes of the lowest-paid workers. Reducing or abolishing the minimum wage would likely lead to lower wages for these workers, increasing the disparity between the lowest and highest earners in the economy.\n*   **Reduction in transfer payments:** Transfer payments, such as unemployment benefits and social welfare, are payments from the government to individuals, typically those with low or no income. They are a direct tool for income redistribution. Reducing these payments would lower the income of the most vulnerable households, widening the gap between them and the rest of the population and thus increasing inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A\n\nThis combination of policies has contradictory effects on income inequality. While a decrease in progressive taxes and a reduction in transfer payments would increase inequality, an increase in the minimum wage is a policy designed to *reduce* inequality by raising the incomes of the lowest-paid workers. Therefore, this combination would not consistently increase inequality.\n\n#### C\n\nThis combination of policies would unequivocally *decrease* the inequality of income and wealth distribution, which is the opposite of the outcome required by the question. Increasing progressive taxes redistributes more income from the wealthy, increasing the minimum wage raises the income floor for the poorest workers, and increasing transfer payments provides greater support to low-income households. Each of these measures aims to create a more equitable distribution of income.\n\n#### D\n\nThis combination of policies has contradictory effects on income inequality. An increase in progressive taxes and an increase in transfer payments are policies that actively reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from higher to lower-income groups.

Leakages are components of income not spent on domestic goods and services (Private Saving, Taxes, Imports), while injections are spending from sources other than domestic consumption (Investment, Government Spending, Exports).\n\nThe identity is:\n**Private Saving (S) + Taxes (T) + Imports (M) = Investment (I) + Government Spending (G) + Exports (X)**\n\nTo find the total private saving (S), we can rearrange this formula:\n**S = I + (G - T) + (X - M)**\n\nLet's break down the components using the data provided:\n1.  **Investment (I):** Given as **$50bn**.\n2.  **Budget Balance (G - T):** The economy has a budget surplus of $20bn. A budget surplus means that tax revenue (T) is greater than government spending (G), so (T - G) = $20bn. Therefore, the budget deficit (G - T) is **-$20bn**.\n3.  **Trade Balance (X - M):** The economy has a trade deficit of $20bn. A trade deficit means that imports (M) are greater than exports (X). Therefore, net exports (X - M) are **-$20bn**.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the rearranged formula:\nS = $50bn + (-$20bn) + (-$20bn)\nS = $50bn - $20bn - $20bn\nS = $10bn\n\nThus, the total private saving in the economy is $10bn.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A. $5bn:** This figure is incorrect. It would likely result from an arithmetical error in applying the savings-investment identity, such as miscalculating the sum of the components after correctly identifying their values.\n\n*   **C. $15bn:** This is an incorrect value. Similar to option A, this outcome would most likely stem from an error in calculation rather than a specific conceptual misunderstanding of the underlying economic relationship.\n\n*   **D. $20bn:** This answer is incorrect. It might be chosen by mistakenly equating total saving with either the budget surplus or the trade deficit. While these components influence the level of saving, they are not equal to it. The correct approach requires incorporating investment and all other relevant flows as dictated by the national income identity S = I + (G - T) + (X - M).

Frictional\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFrictional unemployment refers to the short-term unemployment experienced by individuals who are in the process of moving from one job to another. It is a natural and temporary part of a dynamic labour market. In this scenario, the accountant has been made redundant but possesses skills that are still in demand, as evidenced by the existence of a specialised employment agency for accounting jobs. The period during which the accountant is searching for a new position fits the definition of frictional unemployment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Seasonal:** Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for labour fluctuates with the seasons of the year. Examples include agricultural workers who are unemployed outside the harvesting season or ski instructors in the summer. Accounting is not a seasonal profession; the demand for accountants is relatively consistent throughout the year. Therefore, this is not the correct type of unemployment.\n\n**C. Structural:** Structural unemployment arises from a fundamental shift in the structure of an economy, leading to a long-term mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. This often happens when industries decline (e.g., coal mining) or when there are significant geographical shifts in employment opportunities. The accountant's situation is not structural because their skills are still relevant and marketable; the job loss was due to the failure of a specific company, not a decline in the demand for accountants in the economy as a whole.\n\n**D. Technological:** Technological unemployment is a form of structural unemployment where workers lose their jobs due to automation or the introduction of new technology that renders their skills obsolete.

A key reason for this downward slope is the **wealth effect**, also known as the **real balance effect**.\n\nWhen the average price level falls, the real value of assets with a fixed nominal value, such as money held in bank accounts or cash, increases. This is because each unit of currency can now purchase more goods and services. This increase in real wealth makes consumers feel more prosperous, which encourages them to increase their spending on goods and services (consumption). Since consumption is a major component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)), the rise in consumption leads to a higher quantity of aggregate demand at the lower price level.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a decline in the country's international competitiveness.**\nThis is incorrect. A reduction in the average price level makes a country's goods and services cheaper relative to those produced in other countries. This *increases* the country's international competitiveness, not decreases it. As a result, exports rise (as they are now cheaper for foreigners) and imports fall (as domestic consumers switch to relatively cheaper domestic goods). This increase in net exports (X-M) raises the quantity of aggregate demand, contributing to the downward slope of the AD curve. The option states the opposite effect.\n\n**B: an increase in interest rates.**\nThis is incorrect. According to the **interest rate effect**, a reduction in the average price level leads to a *decrease* in interest rates. When the price level falls, households and firms need less money to conduct their transactions. They tend to save more or lend out their excess money, which increases the supply of loanable funds in the financial markets. An increased supply of loanable funds puts downward pressure on the price of borrowing, which is the interest rate. Lower interest rates, in turn, stimulate investment and consumption, increasing the quantity of aggregate demand.\n\n**D: the expectation of further price falls.**\nThis is incorrect because expectations of future price changes are a determinant that *shifts* the entire aggregate demand curve, rather than explaining the movement along a given curve (its slope). If consumers and businesses expect prices to fall further in the future, they will likely postpone their current consumption and investment, choosing to wait for even lower prices. This would cause a *decrease* in aggregate demand at the current price level, shifting the entire AD curve to the left.

For a payment to be included in the calculation of national income, it must correspond to a contribution to this current production. Welfare benefit payments, such as unemployment benefits or state pensions, are examples of **transfer payments**. These are payments made by the government to individuals for which no goods or services are produced in return. They are a redistribution of existing income (collected through taxes) rather than a creation of new income. Including them would result in double-counting and an overestimation of the nation's actual output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. dividends paid to shareholders**\nThis is incorrect. Dividends are a portion of a company's profits distributed to its shareholders. Profits represent the return to the factor of production known as enterprise or capital. Since these profits are generated from the productive activities of the company, they are a component of national income (when measured by the income approach). Therefore, dividends, as a distribution of this factor income, are included in the measurement.\n\n**B. overtime payments**\nThis is incorrect. Overtime payments are a form of wages or compensation for labour services. Wages are the return to the factor of production 'labour' for its direct contribution to the output of goods and services. As these payments are made in exchange for a productive activity, they are a component of factor incomes and are included in the measurement of national income.\n\n**C. rents from government-owned houses**\nThis is incorrect. Rent is the payment for the use of property, which is a factor of production (land or capital). The provision of housing is a service that contributes to the national output. The income generated from this service, in the form of rent, is therefore included in the calculation of national income, regardless of whether the property is privately or publicly owned.

In 2015, Costa Rica had a positive inflation rate (approximately +0.8%), which indicates that the general level of prices rose. In 2016, the inflation rate for Costa Rica was 0%. A zero percent inflation rate means that, on average, the general price level did not change; prices remained constant. Therefore, this statement accurately describes the situation in Costa Rica as depicted in the graph.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### B: Prices in Ecuador and Mauritius were lower in 2016 than in 2015.\nThis statement is incorrect because it confuses a lower rate of inflation (disinflation) with a fall in the price level (deflation). In both Ecuador and Mauritius, the inflation rate in 2016 was positive (approximately +1.7% and +1.0% respectively). A positive inflation rate signifies that the general price level is rising. Although the rate of price increase was slower in 2016 compared to 2015 for both countries, prices were still higher at the end of 2016 than they were at the end of 2015. For prices to have been lower, the inflation rate would have needed to be negative.\n\n#### C: Prices in India and Malaysia remained constant in 2016 and 2015.\nThis statement is incorrect. It misinterprets the meaning of a constant inflation rate. In both India and Malaysia, the *rate of inflation* was relatively stable across the two years (approximately 4.9% for India and 2.1% for Malaysia). However, a constant, positive rate of inflation means that prices were continuously rising at that steady rate. For prices to have remained constant, the inflation rate would need to have been 0% in both years.\n\n#### D: Prices in Thailand and Japan were lower in 2016 than in 2015.\nThis statement is incorrect because it does not apply to both countries. For the price level to be lower in 2016 than in 2015, a country must experience deflation (a negative inflation rate) in 2016. While Japan did experience slight deflation in 2016 (approximately -0.1%), Thailand's inflation rate in 2016 was positive (approximately +0.2%).

The opportunity cost of 1 unit of X is 50/30 = 5/3 units of Y (approximately 1.67 Y).\n    *   To produce 50 units of Y, Country R gives up 30 units of X. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of Y is 30/50 = 3/5 units of X (or 0.6 X).\n\n2.  **Calculate Opportunity Costs for Country S:**\n    *   To produce 20 units of X, Country S gives up 25 units of Y. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of X is 25/20 = 5/4 units of Y (or 1.25 Y).\n    *   To produce 25 units of Y, Country S gives up 20 units of X. The opportunity cost of 1 unit of Y is 20/25 = 4/5 units of X (or 0.8 X).\n\n3.  **Determine Comparative Advantage:**\n    *   **Product X:** Country S has a lower opportunity cost (1.25 Y) compared to Country R (1.67 Y). Therefore, Country S has a comparative advantage in producing X.\n    *   **Product Y:** Country R has a lower opportunity cost (0.6 X) compared to Country S (0.8 X). Therefore, Country R has a comparative advantage in producing Y.\n\nThe theory of comparative advantage states that if two countries have different opportunity costs of production, they can both gain by specializing in the good in which they have a comparative advantage and trading with each other. Since the opportunity costs for both goods differ between Country R and Country S, a basis for mutually beneficial trade exists. By specializing and trading, both countries can achieve a level of consumption that would be unattainable on their own, thus benefiting both.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. Free trade will benefit neither R nor S.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The fundamental principle of comparative advantage is that differences in opportunity costs create the potential for gains from trade. As calculated, Country R and Country S have different opportunity costs for producing both goods X and Y. This difference is the very condition that allows for specialization and mutually beneficial trade. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that neither country would benefit.\n\n**C. Free trade will benefit R but not S.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The theory of comparative advantage demonstrates that as long as the terms of trade lie between the two countries' opportunity costs, both parties will gain. While it is true that the proposed terms of trade (1 unit of X for 0.5 units of Y) fall outside the mutually beneficial range (which is between 1.25 Y and 1.67 Y for one unit of X), the underlying principle is that a basis for mutual gain exists. The theory itself predicts that both countries can benefit from trade; the specific terms of trade merely determine the distribution of those gains. Concluding that only one country can benefit contradicts the core of the theory.\n\n**D. Free trade will benefit S but not R.**\nThis statement is incorrect for the same reason as option C. The existence of different opportunity costs means there is a basis for mutual gains from trade. Country S has a comparative advantage in product X, and Country R has a comparative advantage in product Y. This creates an opportunity for both to benefit through specialization and exchange. Stating that only Country S will benefit ignores the gains that Country R can achieve by specializing in product Y and trading for product X at a rate better than its domestic production cost."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_205.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 what is the most likely cause of a current account deficit on the balance of payments?\na anundervalued exchange rate\nb_arelatively low rate of inflation\nc_ ashrinking domestic economy\nd  ageneral fall in national productivity", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA general fall in national productivity is a likely cause of a current account deficit. Productivity measures the efficiency of production (output per unit of input). A decline in national productivity means that domestic firms are becoming less efficient, leading to higher average costs of production. This makes domestically produced goods and services more expensive relative to foreign-produced goods. As a result, the country's exports become less price-competitive on the world market, leading to a fall in export demand and revenue. Simultaneously, domestic consumers are likely to switch to cheaper imported alternatives, increasing import expenditure. The combination of falling export revenue and rising import expenditure will cause the current account balance to worsen, leading to a deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. an undervalued exchange rate**\nAn undervalued exchange rate would likely lead to a current account *surplus*, not a deficit. An undervalued currency means its price is artificially low in terms of other currencies. This makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export demand and revenue. At the same time, it makes imports more expensive for domestic consumers, reducing import demand and expenditure. This improvement in the trade balance (exports minus imports) would move the current account towards a surplus.\n\n**B. a relatively low rate of inflation**\nA relatively low rate of inflation, compared to a country's trading partners, would improve the current account balance, not cause a deficit. Low inflation means that the general price level of a country's goods and services is rising more slowly than elsewhere. This increases the international price competitiveness of its exports, leading to higher export volumes and revenue. It also makes domestically produced goods more attractive to local consumers compared to increasingly expensive imports, thereby reducing import expenditure. This tends to create a current account surplus or reduce an existing deficit.\n\n**C. a shrinking domestic economy**\nA shrinking domestic economy (a recession) is more likely to reduce a current account deficit rather than cause one. During a recession, national income, employment, and overall consumer spending fall. As incomes decrease, the demand for all goods and services, including imports, declines. A fall in spending on imports, with other factors held constant, improves the current account balance, moving it towards a surplus.

This policy is designed to stimulate aggregate demand (AD). The movement of the equilibrium point from X to Y on the diagram indicates an increase in both the price level and real output. This change is caused by a rightward shift of the AD curve.\n\nAn **increase in the money supply** means there is more currency in circulation and more funds available in the banking system for lending. This increased liquidity tends to push down the cost of borrowing.\n\nA **decrease in the rate of interest** directly reduces the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms. This incentivises greater spending on consumer durables (consumption, C) and capital goods (investment, I). Simultaneously, a lower interest rate reduces the reward for saving, further encouraging spending. Since AD is composed of C + I + G + (X-M), an increase in C and I will shift the entire AD curve to the right, moving the economy from equilibrium X to a new equilibrium at Y, with higher real output and a higher price level.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: increase money supply, increase rate of interest**\nThis option combines an expansionary policy (increasing money supply) with a contractionary policy (increasing the rate of interest). An increase in the rate of interest would discourage consumption and investment, shifting the AD curve to the left. These two policies work in opposite directions, making the net effect on aggregate demand uncertain. Therefore, this combination would not reliably shift the equilibrium to point Y.\n\n**B: decrease money supply, increase rate of interest**\nThis option describes a contractionary monetary policy. A decrease in the money supply and an increase in the rate of interest would both work to reduce aggregate demand. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, leading to lower consumption and investment. This would cause the AD curve to shift to the left, resulting in a lower price level and lower real output, moving the equilibrium away from point Y.\n\n**D: decrease money supply, decrease rate of interest**\nThis option combines a contractionary policy (decreasing money supply) with an expansionary policy (decreasing the rate of interest). These policies are contradictory. Furthermore, central banks typically increase the money supply to bring about a decrease in the interest rate, so this combination is inconsistent in practice.

Training and retraining directly improve the quality of the labour force, which is a key factor of production. By enhancing workers' skills and adaptability, this policy increases labour productivity and reduces structural unemployment.

The policy described involves the government \"financing\" the training, which means it is a form of government expenditure. Since this policy is implemented through the government's budget, it is an instrument of fiscal policy.

When an economy is operating below full employment, it signifies a recessionary gap, where the primary cause is deficient aggregate demand (AD). Abolishing the minimum wage is a supply-side policy intended to lower firms' production costs. However, in a state of low demand, firms are unlikely to increase production and hire more workers simply because labour is cheaper; there is no market for the additional output. Furthermore, this policy could be counter-productive. Abolishing the minimum wage would reduce the income of the lowest-paid workers, who have a high marginal propensity to consume (MPC). This reduction in income would lead to a decrease in consumption, causing a leftward shift in the AD curve, which would deepen the recession and further reduce real output.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B:** Extra spending on training when the economy is below full employment would be effective. This policy has a dual impact. Firstly, the \"extra spending\" by the government is an injection into the circular flow of income, which directly increases aggregate demand (AD), helping to close the recessionary gap and increase real output in the short run. Secondly, in the long run, training enhances the skills and productivity of the workforce, increasing the economy's productive capacity and shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right.\n\n**C:** Extra investment in infrastructure when the economy is at full employment is a highly effective policy for increasing real output. At full employment, the economy is already producing at its maximum potential. To achieve further growth, the productive capacity (the LRAS curve) must be expanded. Investment in infrastructure, such as transport and communication systems, improves the quality of capital stock, reduces business costs, and increases overall economic efficiency, leading to a rightward shift in the LRAS and a higher level of potential real output.\n\n**D:** A reduction in the rate of income tax when the economy is at full employment can be an effective policy for increasing real output in the long run. This supply-side measure aims to improve incentives.

In the financial market, the interest rate is the price of borrowing money. According to the principles of supply and demand, when the demand for a product (in this case, loanable funds) increases while the supply remains constant, its price will rise. Therefore, the increased competition for funds between the government and the private sector will push up interest rates. This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'crowding out' effect, where government borrowing displaces private investment by making it more expensive to borrow.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a decrease in the budget deficit**\n\nA budget deficit occurs when government expenditure exceeds its revenue in a given period. Expansionary fiscal policy, designed to reduce unemployment, typically involves increasing government spending (e.g., on infrastructure projects or welfare benefits) or decreasing taxes to stimulate aggregate demand. Both of these actions tend to widen the gap between expenditure and revenue, thereby *increasing* the budget deficit, not decreasing it. The government borrows money specifically to finance this larger deficit.\n\n**B. a decrease in the national debt**\n\nThe national debt is the total accumulated borrowing of a government over time; it is the sum of all past budget deficits. Since the government is implementing an expansionary fiscal policy that requires it to borrow more, it will be running a budget deficit for the current period. This new borrowing is added to the existing stock of debt, causing the total national debt to *increase*.\n\n**C. an increase in the balance of payments deficit on the current account**\n\nWhile an increase in the current account deficit is a possible secondary outcome, it is not the most direct or certain result of increased government borrowing. An expansionary fiscal policy would boost national income, which could lead to increased spending on imports, thus worsening the current account balance. Furthermore, the higher interest rates (as explained in option D) could attract foreign financial investment, causing the domestic currency to appreciate. A stronger currency makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which could also lead to an increase in the current account deficit. However, the most immediate and direct consequence of the government borrowing more from banks is the impact on the market for loanable funds itself, which is the rise in interest rates."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_210.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "30 a government wants to use an expansionary monetary policy.\nwhat should the government increase?\na credit regulations\nb_ the exchange rate\nc the interest rate\nd_ the money supply", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: D**\n\nExpansionary monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity by increasing aggregate demand. The primary way a central bank achieves this is by increasing the money supply. When the supply of money in the economy is increased, commercial banks have more reserves, which leads to a lower cost of borrowing (lower interest rates). Lower interest rates encourage both consumers and firms to take out loans for consumption and investment, respectively. This rise in consumption (C) and investment (I) boosts aggregate demand, leading to higher real GDP and potentially lower unemployment.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: credit regulations**\nIncreasing credit regulations would constitute a contractionary, not expansionary, policy. Stricter regulations, such as higher minimum down payments for mortgages or increased capital reserve requirements for banks, make it more difficult and expensive for financial institutions to lend money. This restricts the availability of credit to consumers and businesses, leading to a decrease in borrowing, consumption, and investment, thereby dampening aggregate demand and slowing down the economy.\n\n**B: the exchange rate**\nIncreasing the exchange rate, meaning an appreciation of the domestic currency, would have a contractionary effect on the economy. A stronger currency makes a country's exports more expensive to foreign buyers and makes imports cheaper for domestic consumers. This would likely lead to a decrease in export revenue and an increase in import expenditure, causing a fall in net exports (X-M). Since net exports are a component of aggregate demand, a decrease would reduce overall economic activity, which is the opposite of the goal of an expansionary policy.\n\n**C: the interest rate**\nIncreasing the interest rate is the main tool of contractionary monetary policy, used to combat inflation by reducing aggregate demand. A higher interest rate increases the cost of borrowing for households and firms, which discourages spending on durable goods (like cars and houses) and reduces business investment. This leads to a decrease in aggregate demand. An expansionary policy requires the opposite action: a *decrease* in the interest rate to stimulate spending and investment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_211.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "1. which statement is a normative statement?\na_ the annual rate of inflation in malaysia increased from 2.8% in may 2022 to 3.4%.\nb- the annual rate of inflation was 3.4% in malaysia, lower than the 7.7% annual rate of\ninflation for thailand.\nc_ the malaysian central bank raised interest rates from 2.0% to 2.25% on 6 july 2022.\nd_ the rise in interest rates in malaysia in july 2022 is expected to only have a small impact on\nthe rate of inflation.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nA normative statement expresses a value judgment or opinion about what ought to be.

Since all factors of production are being varied, the firm is making a long-run adjustment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **B. The firm is operating in the very long run.**\n    The **very long run** is a period in which not only are all factors of production variable, but the state of technology itself can also change through innovation and invention. The scenario specifies that the firm \"installed more of the *same* equipment,\" which explicitly indicates that the technology being used has not changed.

Non-rivalry means that the consumption of the good by one individual does not reduce the amount available for consumption by others. National defence is a classic example of a public good. One citizen's protection under the national defence system does not diminish the protection afforded to any other citizen. The statement incorrectly claims the opposite, stating that one citizen's consumption *reduces* the amount available to others. This describes rivalry, which is a characteristic of a private good, not a public good. Therefore, the reasoning in this statement is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Addictive drugs are regarded as demerit goods because users are unaware of the full damage they do.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Demerit goods are goods or services whose consumption is considered unhealthy, degrading, or otherwise socially undesirable due to the negative effects on the consumers themselves. A key reason for their over-consumption in a free market is **information failure**. This means that consumers do not possess or do not fully appreciate the information about the long-term harm or costs associated with the good. In the case of addictive drugs, users often underestimate the risks of addiction, long-term health problems, and social consequences, leading them to consume more than is individually or socially optimal.\n\n**B. Air is regarded as a free good because its use has no opportunity cost.**\n\nThis statement is correct. A **free good** is a good which is not scarce relative to the demand for it. Its supply is so abundant that it can be consumed by anyone without limit and at zero price. Because no resources need to be sacrificed to make it available, there is no **opportunity cost** involved in its consumption. Air is the standard textbook example of a free good; breathing it does not require giving up the consumption of any other good or service. (Note: This refers to unprocessed air; clean air in a polluted city or purified oxygen for medical use are scarce and are therefore classified as economic goods).\n\n**D. Visits to a doctor are regarded as private goods partly because they are rival.**\n\nThis statement is correct. A **private good** is a good that is both **rivalrous** and **excludable**. A good is **rivalrous** (or rival in consumption) if its consumption by one person prevents another person from consuming it. A visit to a doctor is rivalrous because a doctor can only see one patient at a time. The time and expertise of the doctor are scarce resources. When one patient is having a consultation, that specific time slot is consumed and is unavailable to other potential patients. This rivalry is a key characteristic that classifies medical consultations as private goods."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_214.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "4 the diagrams show production possibility curves.\nwhich diagram shows constant opportunity costs?\na b\nconsumer consumer\ngoods goods\noo capital goods oo capital goods\ncc d\nconsumer consumer\ngoods goods\noo capital goods o capital goods", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA production possibility curve (PPC) illustrates the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with a given set of resources and technology. The slope of the PPC represents the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good on the horizontal axis in terms of the good on the vertical axis.

On a Production Possibility Curve (PPC) diagram, any point inside the curve, such as point S, represents productive inefficiency, meaning resources are unemployed or underemployed. An improvement in working practices in agriculture would eliminate this inefficiency, allowing the economy to produce more output with the same resources.

Since the improvement is specific to agriculture, it would most likely lead to a significant increase in the output of agricultural goods.

An increase in consumer incomes will, therefore, cause the demand curve for a normal good to shift to the right. This shift indicates that at any given price, consumers are now willing and able to buy more of the good, and for any given quantity, they are willing to pay a higher price. While this shift leads to a higher equilibrium market price, the overall increase in consumers' willingness to pay is typically greater than the rise in price.

This means that for any given price, the quantity supplied by each firm is added together to find the total market quantity supplied.

A key determinant of PES is the availability of factors of production, which include land, labour, capital, and enterprise.\n\nA shortage of skilled workers directly constrains a firm's ability to increase production, even if the market price for its product rises. Because labour is a critical input, its scarcity means that firms cannot easily expand their output. This makes the quantity supplied less responsive to price changes, resulting in a more inelastic supply. Therefore, a shortage of skilled workers directly affects and reduces the price elasticity of supply.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Cross Elasticity of Demand:**\nCross elasticity of demand (XED) measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good.

This means that at any given price, the individual is willing and able to purchase a smaller quantity of public transport than before. Such a shift is caused by a change in a non-price determinant of demand. A decline in the quality of public transport (e.g., less frequent services, reduced cleanliness, poor punctuality) makes the service less desirable to the consumer. This reduction in utility or satisfaction will cause the individual's demand to fall, resulting in an inward shift of the demand curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The cost of running the individual's car rises.**\nA private car is a substitute good for public transport. If the cost of running a substitute good increases, consumers will switch away from the now relatively more expensive substitute and towards the other good. Therefore, a rise in the cost of running a car would make public transport more attractive, leading to an *increase* in demand for public transport. This would be represented by an outward (rightward) shift of the demand curve, not an inward shift.\n\n**B. The individual is banned from driving.**\nIf an individual is banned from driving, a key substitute for public transport (using their own car) is no longer available. This would force the individual to rely more heavily on alternatives, significantly *increasing* their demand for public transport at all price levels. This would cause a large outward (rightward) shift of the demand curve.\n\n**C. The price of public transport rises.**\nA change in the price of the good itself causes a movement *along* the demand curve, not a shift *of* the curve.

When the government allocates resources to repair and maintain public roads, it is directly providing a service to the population. This is a classic example of government expenditure on infrastructure, which falls under the category of direct provision. The government either uses its own employees and equipment or contracts a private firm to perform the service on its behalf, but in either case, the government is the provider of the service to the end-users (the public).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: making payments to low-income families with elderly dependents**\nThis is an example of a transfer payment, not the direct provision of goods and services. A transfer payment is a redistribution of income from one group (taxpayers) to another (recipients) for which no good or service is provided in return. The government is giving money (purchasing power) to families, who then decide how to spend it on goods and services in the private market. The government itself is not providing the food, housing, or care that the families might purchase.\n\n**C: subsidising firms in order to encourage them to increase their output**\nThis is a form of government intervention aimed at influencing the market, but it is not direct provision. A subsidy is a payment made to a private firm to lower its costs of production. This encourages the firm to produce more and sell at a lower price than it otherwise would. However, it is the private firm, not the government, that is producing and providing the goods or services to consumers.\n\n**D: taxing firms because they have been emitting damaging fumes**\nThis government action is a form of regulation intended to correct a market failure, specifically a negative externality of production (pollution). By imposing a tax, the government forces firms to internalise the external costs of their activities, creating an incentive to reduce pollution.

Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures how responsive the quantity supplied is to a change in the price of the good.\n\nAn elasticity of supply of zero means that supply is **perfectly inelastic**. This is represented by a vertical supply curve. It signifies that the quantity supplied is fixed and will not change, regardless of the price suppliers receive. This situation can occur with goods that have a fixed supply, such as stadium seats for a specific event, unique works of art, or land.\n\nWhen a specific tax is imposed, it increases the costs for suppliers. Typically, suppliers would try to pass some or all of this cost onto consumers by increasing the price. However, because the quantity supplied is fixed, suppliers cannot reduce their output in response to the lower net price they receive after the tax. To sell their fixed quantity of goods, they must accept whatever price consumers are willing to pay for that specific quantity. The market price paid by consumers, therefore, does not change. As a result, the suppliers' revenue per unit falls by the full amount of the tax. They are forced to absorb the entire tax burden themselves.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The burden of this tax will fall entirely on consumers.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The tax burden falls entirely on consumers only when demand is perfectly inelastic (a vertical demand curve) or when supply is perfectly elastic (a horizontal supply curve). In the given scenario, supply is perfectly inelastic, which is the opposite condition required for consumers to bear the full burden.\n\n**C: The burden of this tax will fall mainly on consumers.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The tax burden falls mainly, but not entirely, on consumers when demand is significantly more inelastic than supply. While consumers would bear some of the burden if supply were simply inelastic (but greater than zero), the fact that supply is perfectly inelastic (equal to zero) means consumers bear none of the burden.\n\n**D: The burden of this tax will fall mainly on suppliers.**\n\nThis statement is not precise enough and is therefore incorrect. The burden falls mainly on suppliers when supply is more inelastic than demand. However, the term \"perfectly inelastic\" (elasticity of zero) is an absolute condition. It means that suppliers bear not just the main part of the burden, but 100% of it. The word \"mainly\" implies that consumers bear a small portion, which is not the case here.

Government intervention is often justified to correct these failures.\n\n*   **Healthcare Consumption in a Free Market (Underconsumption):** Healthcare is considered a **merit good**. This means that its consumption generates positive externalities, where the benefits to society are greater than the benefits to the individual consumer. For example, a vaccination not only protects the individual (private benefit) but also helps prevent the spread of disease to others (external benefit). Because consumers in a free market only consider their private benefits (Marginal Private Benefit, MPB) when making consumption decisions, they will demand less healthcare than is socially optimal. The socially optimal level of consumption occurs where the Marginal Social Benefit (MSB), which includes external benefits, equals the Marginal Social Cost (MSC). Since MSB > MPB, the free market results in **underconsumption**.\n\n*   **Healthcare Production in a Free Market (Underproduction):** The quantity of a good or service produced in a market is determined by the level of demand. Since healthcare is underconsumed in a free market, the market demand is lower than the socially desirable level. Consequently, producers will only supply the quantity demanded at the free market price, leading to an **underproduction** and under-allocation of resources to healthcare relative to the social optimum.\n\n*   **Provision of Information in a Free Market (Too Little):** The healthcare market suffers from significant **information failure**, specifically information asymmetry. Healthcare providers (doctors, specialists) possess far more knowledge than consumers (patients). Patients often lack the expertise to accurately diagnose their own conditions, understand complex treatments, or evaluate the quality and necessity of the care they receive. This lack of information can lead them to underestimate the long-term benefits of preventative care or necessary treatments, further contributing to underconsumption. Therefore, there is **too little** information available to consumers for them to make fully informed, rational choices.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: overconsumption, overproduction, too little\nThis is incorrect. Overconsumption and overproduction are characteristic of demerit goods with negative externalities (e.g., pollution from factories). Healthcare, as a merit good with positive externalities, is underconsumed and consequently underproduced in a free market.\n\n#### B: overconsumption, underproduction, too much\nThis is incorrect. Healthcare is underconsumed, not overconsumed, due to positive externalities and information failure. Furthermore, the problem in the healthcare market is a lack of information for consumers (information asymmetry), not an excess of it.\n\n#### D: underconsumption, overproduction, too much\nThis is incorrect. While it correctly identifies underconsumption, it incorrectly states that healthcare is overproduced and that there is too much information.

A price increase is indicated by a rise in the CPI compared to the previous year. While the CPI did rise in most years, it fell from 104 in 2009 to 102 in 2010.

Raw materials are essential inputs for manufacturing and other industries. When these inputs become more expensive, firms face higher per-unit costs. To maintain their profit margins, firms will reduce the quantity they are willing to supply at any given price level. This is represented by a leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. Assuming aggregate demand remains constant, this decrease in aggregate supply leads to a higher equilibrium price level and a lower level of national output. This type of inflation is known as cost-push inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. An increase in the productivity of labour**\n\nAn increase in the productivity of labour means that more output is produced per worker per hour. This enhanced efficiency lowers the average cost of production for firms. With lower production costs, firms are able to supply a greater quantity of goods and services at every price level. This causes the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to shift to the right, leading to a *decrease* in the general price level and an increase in real output, not a rise.\n\n**C. An increase in income taxes**\n\nAn increase in income taxes reduces the disposable income of households. With less money available after taxes, consumer spending, a key component of aggregate demand (AD), will decrease. A fall in aggregate demand is represented by a leftward shift of the AD curve. This shift leads to a *decrease* in the general price level and a reduction in real output, not a rise.\n\n**D. An increase in subsidies paid to producers**\n\nA subsidy is a payment from the government to a producer that lowers their costs of production. An increase in subsidies makes it cheaper for firms to produce goods and services. Consequently, firms are incentivised to increase their output at every price level.

A budget deficit occurs when government spending (G) exceeds government tax revenue (T). Government spending is an injection into the circular flow of income, as it represents demand for goods and services. Taxation is a leakage or withdrawal, as it removes money from the flow. An increase in the budget deficit implies that the injection (G) is increasing relative to the leakage (T). This net injection boosts aggregate demand, leading to a multiplied increase in national income, output, and the overall size of the circular flow.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** An increase in imports represents a leakage or withdrawal from the circular flow of income. When domestic households, firms, or the government spend money on goods and services produced in other countries, this expenditure flows out of the domestic economy. Therefore, a rise in imports reduces the funds available for domestic production and income, causing the circular flow of income to shrink, not increase.\n\n**C:** An increase in interest rates typically leads to a contraction of the circular flow of income. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for both consumers and firms, which discourages spending on consumption and investment. Both consumption (C) and investment (I) are major components of aggregate demand. Furthermore, higher interest rates incentivise saving (S), which is a leakage from the circular flow. The combined effect of reduced spending and increased saving decreases aggregate demand and reduces the size of the circular flow.\n\n**D:** An increase in the exchange rate, also known as currency appreciation, is likely to decrease the circular flow of income. When a country's currency appreciates, its exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to a fall in export demand. Exports (X) are an injection into the circular flow. Simultaneously, imports become cheaper for domestic buyers, leading to a rise in import demand. Imports (M) are a leakage from the circular flow. The combination of falling injections (X) and rising leakages (M) causes a deterioration in the net trade balance (X-M), which reduces aggregate demand and contracts the circular flow of income."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_228.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "18 a country with a constant population experiences a 5% increase in its nominal gdp during a\nyear.\nin which situation will average living standards be most likely to have increased during the year?\na __ if government takes action to ensure there is no increase in unemployment\nb _ if inflation during the year is 3%\nc _ if there is no increase in real national income\ndif there is no redistribution of income", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAverage living standards are most commonly measured by real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. This is calculated as Real GDP divided by the population. The question states that the population is constant, so for average living standards to increase, real GDP must increase.\n\nThe relationship between nominal GDP, real GDP, and inflation is key. Nominal GDP measures output at current prices, while real GDP measures output at constant prices, thereby accounting for the effects of inflation. The approximate relationship is:\n\n**Real GDP Growth Rate \u2248 Nominal GDP Growth Rate - Inflation Rate**\n\nGiven a 5% increase in nominal GDP and an inflation rate of 3%, the real GDP growth rate is approximately:\n\n**5% - 3% = 2%**\n\nSince real GDP has grown by 2% and the population is constant, real GDP per capita has also increased. This signifies an increase in the average quantity of goods and services available to each person, representing a rise in average living standards.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: if government takes action to ensure there is no increase in unemployment**\n\nWhile stable or falling unemployment is a positive economic indicator, it does not, by itself, guarantee a rise in average living standards. The 5% increase in nominal GDP could be entirely due to a 5% inflation rate. In such a scenario, real GDP growth would be zero (5% - 5% = 0%). If real GDP does not grow and the population is constant, real GDP per capita remains unchanged, meaning average living standards have not improved, despite stable unemployment.\n\n**C: if there is no increase in real national income**\n\nReal national income is another term for real GDP. If there is no increase in real national income, and the population remains constant, then real GDP per capita will also be constant. This scenario explicitly states that there has been no growth in the real output of the economy, which is the primary basis for an increase in average material living standards. Therefore, this situation describes a stagnation, not an increase, in living standards.\n\n**D: if there is no redistribution of income**\n\nThis option concerns the distribution of income, not the average level of income. Average living standards (real GDP per capita) refer to the total real income of a country divided by its population. Income redistribution policies affect how that total income is shared among the population (i.e., income equality or inequality). The absence of redistribution does not provide information about whether the total real income itself has grown.

This reflects the positive relationship between the price level and the quantity of real output supplied in the short run. The primary reason for this is the concept of \"sticky\" input prices, particularly nominal wages. When the overall price level rises, firms receive higher prices for their products. However, because wages and other input costs are fixed in the short run, firms' profit margins increase, creating an incentive to expand production.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination requires a positive gradient, with real output on the horizontal x-axis and the price level on the vertical y-axis.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because the gradient of the SRAS curve is positive, not negative.

This policy decreases the budget deficit in two ways:\n1.  **Reduced Government Spending:** Unemployment benefits are a form of government expenditure (a transfer payment).

This is achieved through a combination of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n*   **Expansionary Fiscal Policy:** This involves the government increasing its spending and/or reducing taxation.\n    *   An **increase in government spending (G)** is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, which directly increases aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)).\n    *   A **decrease in taxes (T)** increases the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms. This encourages higher consumption (C) and investment (I), thereby increasing aggregate demand.\n\n*   **Expansionary Monetary Policy:** This involves the central bank increasing the money supply. An **increase in the money supply** typically leads to lower interest rates, which reduces the cost of borrowing. This stimulates both consumption spending (on durable goods) and investment spending by firms, leading to an increase in aggregate demand.\n\nOption C combines all three of these expansionary measures: an increase in government spending, a decrease in taxes, and an increase in the money supply. As all policies are working in the same direction to boost aggregate demand, this combination would certainly be expansionary.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A\nThis combination of policies is not certainly expansionary. Decreasing government spending and decreasing the money supply are both **contractionary** policies, as they reduce aggregate demand. While decreasing taxes is an **expansionary** policy, it is working in opposition to the other two measures. The overall effect on the economy is ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitude of the changes, but it is highly unlikely to be expansionary.\n\n#### B\nThis combination of policies is **contractionary**, not expansionary. A decrease in government spending, an increase in taxes, and a decrease in the money supply all work to reduce aggregate demand. This set of policies would be used to combat high inflation by slowing down the economy, which is the opposite of an expansionary objective.\n\n#### D\nThis combination of policies is not certainly expansionary because it contains conflicting policy tools. While an increase in government spending and an increase in the money supply are both expansionary, an increase in taxes is **contractionary**. A tax increase reduces disposable income and corporate profits, dampening consumption and investment. The expansionary effect of higher government spending could be partially or fully offset by the contractionary effect of higher taxes.

Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms, which discourages consumption and investment spending. If AD is highly responsive to interest rate changes, a given increase in the interest rate will cause a large decrease in consumption and investment, leading to a significant leftward shift of the AD curve. This large shift is a necessary condition for a major impact.\n\n2.  **Position on the PPC:** An economy operating on its PPC is at full employment of its resources. This corresponds to the vertical or very steep section of the aggregate supply (AS) curve. When the AS curve is steep, any change in AD has a much larger effect on the price level than on real output. Therefore, if the economy is at full employment and experiences a significant fall in AD, the primary result will be a substantial reduction in the general price level. The combination of a large AD shift and a steep AS curve yields the maximum possible impact on prices.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: below the PPC, high responsiveness**\nWhile a high responsiveness of aggregate demand would lead to a significant leftward shift of the AD curve, the policy's impact on the price level would be limited. An economy operating below its PPC has significant spare capacity and unemployment, which corresponds to the flatter, or Keynesian, range of the aggregate supply (AS) curve. On this portion of the AS curve, a decrease in AD primarily causes a fall in real output and employment, with only a small reduction in the general price level.\n\n**B: below the PPC, low responsiveness**\nThis scenario would result in the policy having the least impact. A low responsiveness of aggregate demand means that even a substantial rise in interest rates will only cause a small decrease in consumption and investment, leading to a minimal leftward shift of the AD curve. Furthermore, with the economy operating below its PPC (on the flatter part of the AS curve), this small shift in AD would translate into a negligible fall in the price level, making the policy highly ineffective at achieving its goal.\n\n**D: on the PPC, low responsiveness**\nAlthough the economy operating on its PPC (on the steep part of the AS curve) creates a situation where changes in AD have a strong effect on the price level, the impact of the policy would still be small. A low responsiveness of aggregate demand to interest rate changes means that the monetary policy action will only generate a small leftward shift in the AD curve. A small shift in AD, even against a steep AS curve, will only result in a small reduction in the general price level.

Higher domestic inflation means that the prices of goods and services produced within the country are rising relative to those in other countries. This has a two-fold effect on the balance of trade. Firstly, it makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing their price competitiveness and leading to a fall in the quantity and value of exports. Secondly, it makes imported goods and services relatively cheaper for domestic consumers compared to domestically produced alternatives. This encourages a switch in spending towards imports, leading to a rise in import expenditure.

Improved skills among workers in the industrial sector lead to higher labour productivity. This means more output can be produced per worker, which lowers the average cost of production for firms. With lower production costs, firms can reduce the prices of their goods, making them more price-competitive in international markets. This enhanced international competitiveness will most likely lead to an increase in demand for these goods from foreign countries, resulting in a rise in the value of exports. As exports are a credit (inflow of money) on the current account of the balance of payments, a rise in exports improves the current account position.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: exports fall**\nThis is incorrect. Improving the skills of the workforce enhances productivity and lowers production costs. This makes a country's goods more, not less, competitive in global markets. Therefore, it is logical to expect exports to rise, not fall.\n\n**C: imports fall**\nWhile a fall in imports is a possible secondary effect, it is not the most likely or direct outcome. If the improved domestic industrial goods become cheaper and of higher quality, domestic consumers might substitute them for previously imported goods (import substitution). However, the primary effect of becoming more competitive internationally is an increased ability to sell goods to other countries (export). The impact on exports is generally considered more direct and significant than the potential for import substitution.\n\n**D: imports rise**\nThis is incorrect. The policy makes domestically produced industrial goods more competitive relative to foreign imports. This should either decrease the demand for imports within that sector or have no effect; it would not directly cause imports to rise.

Therefore, Country X should specialise in and produce only steel, while Country Y should specialise in and produce only wheat.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### B: Country X will not gain from international trade.\nThis is incorrect. The principle of comparative advantage demonstrates that countries can achieve gains from trade by specialising in the production of goods where they have a lower opportunity cost. Country X can produce steel more efficiently (in terms of wheat given up) than Country Y. By specialising in steel and trading with Country Y, Country X can acquire wheat at a lower opportunity cost than if it produced wheat itself. For example, it could trade one tonne of its steel for more than the 3 tonnes of wheat it would get by reallocating its own resources, leading to consumption possibilities beyond its own production possibility frontier.\n\n#### C: Country Y has no comparative advantage.\nThis is incorrect. A comparative advantage is determined by having a lower opportunity cost. As calculated above, the opportunity cost for Country Y to produce 1 tonne of wheat is 1/4 of a tonne of steel, while for Country X it is 1/3 of a tonne of steel. Since 1/4 is less than 1/3, Country Y has a comparative advantage in the production of wheat. Unless the opportunity costs are identical for both countries, each country will have a comparative advantage in one of the goods.\n\n#### D: Country Y will not gain from international trade.\nThis is incorrect. Just as Country X gains from trade, so does Country Y. Country Y has a comparative advantage in wheat production. By specialising in wheat and trading with Country X, it can obtain steel at a lower opportunity cost than its domestic production cost of 4 tonnes of wheat per tonne of steel.

This will lead to a decrease in the quantity of imports from country X demanded by country Y. To purchase goods from country X, residents of country Y must first purchase country X's currency. Therefore, a fall in the demand for country X's exports leads to a corresponding fall in the demand for country X's currency on the foreign exchange market. A decrease in demand for a currency, ceteris paribus, causes its value to fall. This results in a depreciation, or a fall in the exchange rate, of country X's currency.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. economic growth:** An increase in economic growth in country Y would lead to higher average incomes. With more disposable income, consumers in country Y would likely increase their spending on all goods and services, including imports from their trade partner, country X. To buy more goods from country X, residents of Y would need to sell their currency to buy currency X. This would increase the demand for country X's currency, causing its exchange rate to appreciate (rise), not fall.\n\n**B. inflation rate:** An increase in the inflation rate in country Y means that the general price level of goods and services in Y is rising faster than in country X. This makes country X's exports relatively cheaper for consumers in Y, and country Y's exports relatively more expensive for consumers in X. Consequently, demand for country X's exports will likely rise, while demand for country Y's exports will fall. The increased demand for country X's goods translates into an increased demand for its currency, leading to an appreciation (a rise) in its exchange rate.\n\n**C. money supply:** An increase in the money supply in country Y typically leads to lower domestic interest rates and may also lead to higher inflation.

It will increase costs of production for domestic firms.**\n\nThis statement is correct. A tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. In this case, the tariff is applied to raw materials, which are essential inputs for many domestic manufacturing and production processes. By imposing a tariff, the government increases the price that domestic firms must pay for these imported raw materials. This direct increase in the cost of inputs raises the overall costs of production for firms that rely on them. As production costs rise, the supply curve for the final goods produced by these firms will shift to the left, indicating a decrease in supply at any given price.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. It will increase consumer surplus for domestic consumers.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Consumer surplus is the difference between the total amount consumers are willing and able to pay for a good and the total amount they actually do pay. The tariff on raw materials increases production costs for domestic firms. These firms are likely to pass on these higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices for the final goods. An increase in the price of goods reduces consumer surplus, as consumers either have to pay more for the same quantity or buy less. Therefore, the tariff will lead to a decrease, not an increase, in consumer surplus.\n\n**C. It will reduce government revenue.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A tariff is a form of tax, and taxes are a primary source of revenue for the government. When a tariff is placed on imported raw materials, the government collects this tax for each unit of the material that is imported. This generates a new stream of income for the government. While a very high tariff might drastically reduce the quantity of imports and thus limit revenue, the initial imposition of a tariff is designed to increase government revenue.\n\n**D. There will be a fall in the price of imports and a rise in the demand.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A tariff increases the domestic price of imported goods. The new price for domestic buyers becomes the original world price plus the amount of the tariff.

This means that, for a given volume of exports, a country can now afford to buy a larger volume of imports. This happens when the average price of its exports rises at a faster rate than the average price of its imports. Therefore, if the price of its imports rises by less than the prices of its exports, the numerator in the formula grows more than the denominator, leading to an increase in the ToT index and an improvement in the terms of trade.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Its imports rise in value less than its exports.**\nThis statement refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, which is a component of the current account of the balance of payments. The *value* of trade is determined by both price and volume (Value = Price \u00d7 Volume). A country's export value could rise more than its import value simply because it is exporting a much larger volume of goods, even if the price per unit (and thus the terms of trade) has fallen.

Its imports rise in volume less than its exports.**\nThis statement describes the change in the *quantity* (or volume) of goods and services traded. The terms of trade, however, are concerned exclusively with the relative *prices* of exports and imports, not the volumes traded. It is possible for export volumes to rise significantly while export prices fall, leading to a deterioration in the terms of trade.

External receipts and payments include not only trade in goods and services but also income flows and capital transfers. An improvement in the balance of payments could be caused by large capital inflows (e.g., foreign investment), which are unrelated to the relative prices of goods and services.

The fundamental economic problem of scarcity and choice means that to produce more of one good, resources must be diverted from the production of another. The value of the good that is sacrificed is known as the opportunity cost. The slope of the PPC at any point represents the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good on the horizontal axis in terms of the good on the vertical axis. Consequently, by observing the trade-off required to move from one point to another along the curve, one can determine the opportunity cost of producing more manufactured goods in terms of the agricultural products that must be forgone.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The PPC illustrates the production possibilities or the supply side of an economy. It shows what combinations of goods can be produced. It does not, however, provide information about consumer preferences or the demand side of the economy. The combination of goods that consumers' prefer would be shown by an indifference curve, and the allocatively efficient point for an economy is where the PPC is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve. The PPC alone does not reveal this preferred combination.\n\n**B:** A single PPC depicts the productive capacity of an economy at a specific point in time. Economic growth, which is an increase in an economy's productive capacity, is represented by an outward shift of the entire PPC. Since the diagram shows only one static curve, it represents a snapshot of the economy's potential and does not provide information about changes over time. Therefore, the level or rate of economic growth cannot be determined from a single PPC.\n\n**D:** The trade-off between present and future consumption is typically illustrated on a PPC with 'consumer goods' and 'capital goods' on the axes. Choosing to produce more capital goods (investment) at the expense of consumer goods can lead to future economic growth. While the diagram shows a trade-off, it is between manufactured and agricultural goods, not explicitly between present and future consumption. Furthermore, the PPC only shows the possible trade-offs; it does not indicate which choice society will make.

Workers get bored if they are repeating the same work.**\n\nThis is the most likely reason for the described pattern of productivity. Specialisation involves the division of labour, where workers focus on a single, narrow task.\n\n1.  **Initial Increase in Productivity:** In the short term (the first six months), specialisation leads to significant gains in output per worker. Workers become highly proficient and quick at their specific task through constant repetition and practice. This explains the initial increase in productivity.\n\n2.  **Subsequent Decrease in Productivity:** However, in the longer term, performing the same simple, repetitive task can lead to monotony, boredom, and low morale. This psychological impact, sometimes referred to as 'worker alienation', can cause a decline in concentration, an increase in errors, and a general lack of motivation to work efficiently. Consequently, the initial gains in productivity are eroded, and output per worker begins to fall. This matches the scenario described after the first six months.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. An increase in output per worker in the long run depends on an increase in pay.**\n\nWhile higher pay can be a motivator and may contribute to sustained productivity (as suggested by efficiency wage theory), it is not the most direct explanation for the fall in productivity described. The question points to a consequence of the specialisation process itself. The core issue is the nature of the work, which becomes monotonous. A lack of a pay rise is a separate, external factor that is not necessarily implied by the scenario. The boredom resulting from repetitive tasks provides a more direct cause-and-effect relationship linked to specialisation.\n\n**B. An increase in output per worker requires more capital.**\n\nThis statement is generally true; investing in more or better capital (machinery, technology) is a key driver of productivity growth. However, it does not explain why productivity would *fall* after an initial increase. A lack of new capital would likely lead to productivity stagnating or growing more slowly, but it wouldn't typically cause an absolute decline in the output of workers who had previously become more efficient through specialisation. The problem described is a negative development within the existing production system, not the absence of a new improvement.\n\n**C. Specialisation means workers lose skills.**\n\nThis refers to a known disadvantage of specialisation, where workers become 'de-skilled' in a broader sense, losing the versatility to perform other tasks. This makes them vulnerable to structural unemployment if their specific job becomes obsolete.

It involves risk-taking with the goal of generating future profits.\n2.  **Capital:** The expansion will require new capital goods, such as more machinery for bottling, larger fermentation vats, new buildings, or delivery vehicles. The money raised from selling shares is financial capital, which is used to purchase this physical capital.\n3.  **Land:** To increase wine production, the firm will need more raw materials, primarily grapes. This requires the use of land, which encompasses all natural resources, including the agricultural land for vineyards, water, and sunlight.\n4.  **Labour:** An increase in the scale of production will necessitate hiring more workers. This includes agricultural labour to tend the vineyards, factory workers to operate the bottling plant, and managerial staff to oversee the expanded operations.\n\nSince the expansion involves decision-making and risk-taking (enterprise), financing new equipment (capital), requiring more raw materials (land), and hiring more workers (labour), all four factors of production are involved.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **B: labour, land and capital only**\n    This option is incorrect because it omits the factor of enterprise. The entire initiative to expand production, organise the necessary resources (land, labour, capital), and bear the financial risk is the role of the entrepreneur. Without enterprise, the expansion would not be conceived or implemented.\n\n*   **C: enterprise and land only**\n    This option is incorrect because it omits labour and capital. Expanding production is not possible with only ideas (enterprise) and raw materials (land). It requires human effort (labour) to carry out the production tasks and man-made goods (capital) such as machinery and buildings to facilitate the increased output.\n\n*   **D: enterprise only**\n    This option is incorrect because enterprise is the factor that organises the other three factors of production.

It describes \"what is\" without incorporating value judgments. The statement \"Income inequality is decreasing\" is a claim that can be empirically tested by analysing economic statistics, such as the Gini coefficient or the share of income held by different population quintiles over a period. The statement may be factually correct or incorrect, but its validity can be determined through objective analysis, which is the defining characteristic of a positive statement.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. All taxes should be proportional to income.**\nThis is a normative statement. Normative statements are subjective and based on value judgments, expressing an opinion about \"what ought to be.\" The use of the word \"should\" indicates a policy prescription or a belief about how the tax system should be structured, rather than a factual claim. There is no objective way to test whether taxes *should* be proportional; it is a matter of economic and political philosophy.\n\n**B. A progressive tax is a fair tax.**\nThis is a normative statement because it involves a value judgment. The concept of \"fairness\" is subjective and varies among individuals and societies. While one might argue that a progressive tax (where higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in tax) is fair based on the ability-to-pay principle, another might argue it is unfair because it penalises success. As \"fairness\" cannot be empirically measured or tested, the statement is based on opinion, not fact.\n\n**C. Greater equality of income is desirable.**\nThis is a normative statement. It expresses a subjective preference or goal about the ideal distribution of income in a society. The term \"desirable\" signals a value judgment. While economists can analyse the causes and consequences of income inequality (positive analysis), determining whether more equality is desirable involves ethical and philosophical considerations that are outside the scope of objective, fact-based economic analysis."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_245.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 the diagram shows the change in a country\u2019s production possibility curve from pq to pr.\np\npublic\ngoods\nie) q r\nprivate goods\nwhat increases as a result of the change from pq to pr?\na the price of private goods\nb _ the price of public goods\nc_ the opportunity cost of private goods\nd_ the opportunity cost of public goods", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe opportunity cost of public goods is the amount of private goods that must be given up to produce one additional unit of public goods.

This indicates that the economy's productive capacity for private goods has increased (from a maximum of OQ to OR), while the maximum productive capacity for public goods has remained the same (at OP).\n\nAs a result of this change, the PPC has become flatter. This means that to increase the production of public goods by a certain amount (i.e., to move up along the curve), the economy must now forego a larger quantity of private goods than before the change. For example, moving from the maximum production of private goods (point R on the new curve) to the maximum production of public goods (point P) requires giving up OR amount of private goods, which is greater than the OQ amount that had to be given up on the old curve. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing public goods has increased.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: the price of private goods**\nA Production Possibility Curve illustrates the maximum potential output combinations of two goods given available resources and technology. It does not provide any information about the demand for these goods or their market prices. While an increase in the ability to produce private goods represents an increase in potential supply, which could lead to a lower price, this cannot be concluded from the PPC diagram alone.\n\n**B: the price of public goods**\nSimilar to private goods, the PPC does not determine prices. Furthermore, public goods are typically non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they are not usually sold in a market and thus do not have a market price. They are generally provided by the government and financed through taxation. Therefore, the concept of a \"price\" for public goods in this context is not directly applicable.\n\n**C: the opportunity cost of private goods**\nThe opportunity cost of private goods is the amount of public goods that must be sacrificed to produce one additional unit of private goods. The pivotal shift of the PPC from PQ to PR has made the curve flatter. A flatter slope indicates that for every additional unit of private goods produced (moving right along the x-axis), a smaller amount of public goods must be given up.

A supply curve is considered price elastic when a firm can significantly increase its output in response to a price increase. For a labour-intensive firm, the ability to quickly and easily hire more workers is the key determinant of its supply elasticity.\n\nThe conditions for the most elastic supply are met when the firm employs **unskilled labour** and there is a **high level of unemployment** in the economy.\n\n1.  **Unskilled Labour:** Unskilled workers do not require extensive training or specific qualifications. This means there is a large potential pool of workers, and new staff can be hired and become productive very quickly. This allows the firm to rapidly scale up production when the price of its good rises.\n\n2.  **High Unemployment:** A high level of unemployment signifies a large surplus of available labour in the economy. This makes it easy for the firm to find and hire new workers without having to offer significantly higher wages to attract them from other jobs. The ready availability of labour facilitates a quick expansion of output.\n\nTherefore, the combination of needing only unskilled labour and having a large pool of unemployed workers to draw from makes it easiest for the firm to increase supply in response to a higher price, resulting in the most price-elastic supply.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: skilled, high**\nWhile high unemployment provides a pool of available workers, the requirement for skilled labour acts as a significant constraint. Skilled workers are, by definition, less common and take longer to find and train. This difficulty in acquiring the necessary labour would slow down the firm's ability to increase production, making supply less elastic compared to a situation where unskilled labour is used.\n\n**B: skilled, low**\nThis combination creates the conditions for the *least* elastic (most inelastic) supply. The firm requires skilled labour, which is difficult to find, and the low level of unemployment means there is a very small pool of available workers. The firm would have to compete fiercely for scarce labour, likely by offering much higher wages, making it very difficult and costly to expand production quickly.\n\n**D: unskilled, low**\nAlthough the firm uses unskilled labour, which is generally easy to find, a low level of unemployment creates a labour shortage. With most people already employed, it would be more difficult and costly for the firm to hire the additional workers needed to increase output. This labour market tightness would constrain the firm's ability to respond to a price rise, making supply less elastic than in a high-unemployment environment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_248.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 what is most likely to cause the demand curve of an inferior good to shift to the right?\na_ arise in consumers\u2019 incomes\nb_ arise in income tax\nc arise in sales tax\nd arise in the price of a complement", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAn inferior good is defined as a good for which demand decreases as consumer income rises, and demand increases as consumer income falls. A rightward shift in the demand curve signifies an increase in demand at every price level.\n\nA rise in income tax reduces consumers' disposable income (the amount of money available for spending and saving after taxes have been paid). With lower disposable income, consumers are less able to afford normal goods and will substitute towards cheaper alternatives. Since inferior goods are these cheaper alternatives, the demand for them will increase. This increase in demand is represented by a shift of the entire demand curve to the right.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a rise in consumers' incomes**\n\nThis is incorrect. By definition, the demand for an inferior good has an inverse relationship with income. When consumers' incomes rise, they tend to switch from consuming inferior goods to more expensive, higher-quality normal goods. This would lead to a *decrease* in the demand for the inferior good, causing its demand curve to shift to the *left*, not to the right.\n\n**C: a rise in sales tax**\n\nThis is incorrect. A rise in sales tax on a good increases its effective price to the consumer. A change in the good's own price causes a change in the *quantity demanded*, which is represented by a *movement along* the demand curve, not a shift of the entire curve. Specifically, a higher price would lead to a contraction in quantity demanded (a movement up and to the left along the curve). A shift in the demand curve is caused by a change in a non-price determinant of demand.\n\n**D: a rise in the price of a complement**\n\nThis is incorrect. Complementary goods are products that are consumed together (e.g., printers and ink). If the price of a complementary good rises, its quantity demanded will fall. Consequently, the demand for the good it is consumed with (the inferior good in this case) will also fall, as consumers will be using less of the pair.

This means that for any change in price, the quantity supplied changes by the same percentage. A key geometric characteristic of a supply curve with constant unitary elasticity is that it is a straight line that passes through the origin (0,0).\n\nFor any linear supply curve originating from the origin, the ratio of price (P) to quantity (Q) at any point on the curve is constant and equal to the slope of the curve (P/Q = m). The formula for point elasticity of supply is PES = (\u0394Q/\u0394P) \u00d7 (P/Q). For a straight line, the term (\u0394Q/\u0394P) is constant and is the inverse of the slope (1/m). Therefore, substituting these values gives: PES = (1/m) \u00d7 (m) = 1. This holds true for every point along Curve A.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nCurve B is a vertical line. This represents a situation of perfectly inelastic supply, where the price elasticity of supply (PES) is equal to 0. A vertical supply curve indicates that the quantity supplied is fixed and does not change at all, regardless of any change in price. For example, the supply of seats in a stadium is fixed. As the percentage change in quantity supplied is always zero, the PES is zero.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nCurve C is an S-shaped curve, which shows variable elasticity along its length. At lower levels of output (closer to the origin), the curve is relatively flat, indicating that supply is elastic (PES > 1). This means a small percentage change in price leads to a larger percentage change in quantity supplied. As output increases, the curve becomes steeper, indicating that supply is becoming inelastic (PES < 1). This reflects production capacity constraints, where large price increases are needed to incentivise small increases in output. Since the elasticity is not constant and is not equal to 1 at all points, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nCurve D is a horizontal line. This represents a situation of perfectly elastic supply, where the price elasticity of supply (PES) is infinite (\u221e). A horizontal supply curve indicates that producers are willing and able to supply any quantity of the good at a specific price, but will supply nothing at a price below this level.

The new consumer surplus is the area above the new price line P\u2082 and below the demand curve D. This is the unlabelled triangle above area `s`.\n*   **Change in Consumer Surplus:** The change is the initial surplus minus the new surplus. The areas `s` and `t` are no longer part of the consumer surplus. Therefore, consumer surplus decreases by the sum of area `s` and area `t`.\n\n**Explanation of Producer Surplus Change:**\nProducer surplus is the difference between the amount a producer receives for a good and the minimum amount they would be willing to accept. It is represented by the area above the supply curve and below the market price. The change in producer surplus is calculated by finding the new surplus and subtracting the old surplus.\n*   **Initial Producer Surplus (at price P\u2081):** The area below the price line P\u2081 and above the supply curve S\u2081. This is equal to the sum of the areas `u`, `v`, and `w`. So, PS\u2081 = u + v + w.\n*   **New Producer Surplus (at price P\u2082):** After the supply decreases to the quantity shown by S\u2082, the price rises to P\u2082. The new producer surplus is the area below the new price P\u2082 and above the original supply curve S\u2081 (which represents the producers' marginal cost), up to the new quantity. This area is equal to the sum of areas `s`, `u`, and `w`. So, PS\u2082 = s + u + w.\n*   **Change in Producer Surplus (\u0394PS):** The change is calculated as \u0394PS = PS\u2082 - PS\u2081.\n    *   \u0394PS = (s + u + w) - (u + v + w)\n    *   \u0394PS = s - v\n    *   This indicates that producers gain area `s` (a transfer from consumers due to the higher price on the remaining units) but lose area `v` (the surplus on units that are no longer sold).\n\n*Note: There appears to be an error in the question's provided options, as the correct change in producer surplus based on standard economic principles is `s - v`.

The decrease in consumer surplus is `s + t`, not just `s`.

The decrease in consumer surplus is `s + t`, not just `s`. The calculation for the change in producer surplus is also incorrect.\n\n**C: decreases by s + t / increases by s + t \u2013 v**\nThis is incorrect. While the change in consumer surplus is correctly identified as a decrease of `s + t`, the change in producer surplus is wrong. It incorrectly adds `t` to the producer surplus calculation.

When the price of a substitute good (Y) decreases, consumers will switch from the relatively more expensive good (X) to the cheaper substitute (Y). This causes the demand for good X to decrease, shifting its demand curve to the left.\n    *   **Complement Effect:** Good Z is a complement to good X, meaning they are often consumed together. When the price of a complementary good (Z) increases, the total cost of consuming the pair (X and Z) rises. This leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of Z and, consequently, a decrease in the demand for good X. This also shifts the demand curve for good X to the left.\n\n    Both of these events cause a decrease in the demand for good X. A leftward shift in the demand curve, holding supply constant, would lead to a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity.\n\n2.  **Counteracting Change in Supply:**\n    For the equilibrium price to remain unchanged despite a decrease in demand, there must be a simultaneous decrease in supply. A decrease in supply (a leftward shift of the supply curve) puts upward pressure on the price. If the magnitude of the supply decrease is such that its upward pressure on price exactly offsets the downward pressure from the decrease in demand, the equilibrium price can remain the same (although the equilibrium quantity would decrease).\n\n    The option \"Some firms stop production of good X\" describes a scenario where the market supply of good X decreases. The exit of firms from the market reduces the total quantity supplied at every price level, causing the supply curve to shift to the left. This is the condition required to potentially keep the equilibrium price unchanged.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) Producers of good X adopt new technology.**\nThe adoption of new technology typically increases efficiency and lowers the costs of production. This would cause an *increase* in the supply of good X, shifting the supply curve to the right. A decrease in demand combined with an increase in supply would both exert downward pressure on the price, leading to a significant *decrease* in the equilibrium price, not keeping it unchanged.\n\n**B) Producers of good X receive a subsidy.**\nA subsidy from the government acts as a reduction in the cost of production for firms. This would lead to an *increase* in the supply of good X, shifting the supply curve to the right. Similar to the adoption of new technology, this would reinforce the price-lowering effect of the demand decrease, causing the equilibrium price to fall.\n\n**D) The tax on the production of good X is cut.**\nCutting a tax on production reduces firms' costs. This would incentivize firms to produce more at every price level, causing an *increase* in the supply of good X and shifting the supply curve to the right.

In contrast, individuals and households who do not own property (often those with lower incomes) see no change in their wealth. This divergence directly widens the wealth gap.\n\nWhile rising property values can eventually lead to higher rental income for landlords, this effect on income is secondary and often lags behind the capital appreciation of the asset. The primary impact is the immediate increase in the stock of wealth for owners, thus making wealth inequality greater, often without a corresponding immediate change in income distribution.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. an increase in indirect taxation**\n\nAn increase in indirect taxation (e.g., Value Added Tax or sales tax) primarily affects income inequality. Indirect taxes are generally regressive, meaning they take a larger percentage of income from low-income households than from high-income households, because lower-income groups spend a larger proportion of their income on goods and services. This directly reduces the disposable income of the poor more than the rich, thus worsening income inequality. While reduced disposable income makes it harder for the poor to accumulate wealth, the most direct and significant impact of this policy is on the distribution of income, not wealth.\n\n**C. a reduction in the minimum wage**\n\nA reduction in the minimum wage directly impacts the earnings of the lowest-paid workers, lowering their income. This action widens the gap between the lowest earners and those on middle and high incomes, thereby directly increasing income inequality. The effect on wealth is a secondary consequence; with lower incomes, the ability of these workers to save and accumulate wealth is diminished, but the primary and most immediate effect is on the flow of income.\n\n**D. a reduction in the rate of interest paid on savings**\n\nA reduction in the interest rate paid on savings directly lowers the income that can be earned from holding money in bank accounts. This is a direct impact on income inequality, as it affects the returns on a financial asset. While the wealthy hold more savings in absolute terms, their wealth is often diversified into other assets like stocks and property. This policy also makes it more difficult for individuals to build wealth through saving, but its initial effect is a change in the income generated from wealth, rather than a change in the value of the underlying assets themselves. Therefore, its impact is more closely tied to income distribution than that of a large-scale increase in property values."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_254.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 a product with infinite elasticity of supply has sales of 1000 units a week at a price of $1 per unit.\nprice elasticity of demand is 1.5 over the relevant range.\nthe government imposes a tax of 10%.\nwhat will be the government\u2019s weekly tax revenue from this product?\na $15 b $85 c $100 d $150", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe government's weekly tax revenue is calculated by multiplying the tax per unit by the number of units sold after the tax is imposed.\n\n1.  **Determine the tax incidence and the new price:** The elasticity of supply is infinite, which means the supply curve is perfectly horizontal at the market price of $1. In this situation, producers will only supply the product if they receive exactly $1 per unit. Therefore, the entire burden of any tax will be passed on to the consumers. The tax is 10% of the initial price, which is 10% of $1 = $0.10 per unit. This means the price for consumers will increase by the full amount of the tax, from $1.00 to $1.10.\n\n2.  **Calculate the change in quantity demanded:** The price increase for consumers is $0.10 / $1.00 = 10%. The price elasticity of demand (PED) is given as 1.5.

This is incorrect because it fails to account for the law of demand and the given price elasticity of demand (1.5). The price increase from the tax will cause the quantity demanded to fall, so the new quantity sold will be less than 1000. This calculation would only be correct if demand were perfectly inelastic (PED = 0).\n\n**D: $150**\nThis value represents the reduction in the quantity of units sold (150 units), not the government's tax revenue.

During an economic downturn or recession, aggregate demand in the economy falls. The scenario describes a virus pandemic leading to falling incomes, which causes a significant reduction in overall spending and aggregate demand. In response to this lower demand for goods and services, firms cut back on production and lay off workers. This type of unemployment, directly tied to a contractionary phase of the business cycle, is classified as cyclical unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. frictional**\nFrictional unemployment is the short-term unemployment experienced by individuals who are in the process of moving between jobs, entering the workforce for the first time, or re-entering after a period of absence. It is a natural and unavoidable component of a dynamic labour market. The unemployment described in the scenario is not due to the normal process of job searching but is caused by a widespread, economy-wide shock that reduces the total number of available jobs.\n\n**C. seasonal**\nSeasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for labour in certain industries varies with the seasons of the year. Examples include agricultural workers who are unemployed after the harvest season or ski resort employees during the summer. The unemployment caused by a pandemic is not a predictable, recurring seasonal pattern but rather an unexpected and severe shock to the entire economy.\n\n**D. structural**\nStructural unemployment results from a long-term mismatch between the skills possessed by the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. This can be caused by technological advancements, changes in the structure of the economy (e.g., a decline in manufacturing), or geographical shifts in industries. While a pandemic might lead to structural changes in the long run, the immediate unemployment caused by a general fall in incomes and demand across the economy is a cyclical issue, not one primarily of a skills mismatch."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_257.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "17 what is likely to move an economy\u2019s aggregate demand curve to the right?\na afall in income equality\nbsa fall in incomes abroad\nc a fall in the exchange rate\nd sa fall in the government budget deficit", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA fall in the exchange rate, also known as a depreciation of the currency, makes the domestic economy's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and its imports more expensive for domestic buyers. The lower price of exports will increase the quantity of exports demanded (X), while the higher price of imports will decrease the quantity of imports demanded (M). Since net exports (X-M) are a component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)), an increase in exports and a decrease in imports will lead to an increase in net exports. This rise in net exports causes an increase in aggregate demand at every price level, shifting the AD curve to the right.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a fall in income equality**\n\nA fall in income equality means that income is being redistributed from lower-income households to higher-income households. Lower-income households typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC) \u2013 they spend a larger proportion of any additional income they receive. Conversely, higher-income households have a lower MPC and a higher marginal propensity to save. Therefore, redistributing income towards the wealthy is likely to decrease overall consumption (C), a key component of aggregate demand. A fall in consumption would shift the aggregate demand curve to the left, not to the right.\n\n**B. a fall in incomes abroad**\n\nA fall in the income levels of foreign countries reduces their purchasing power. Consequently, their demand for goods and services, including those imported from the domestic economy, will decrease. This leads to a fall in the domestic economy's export revenue (X). Since net exports (X-M) are a component of aggregate demand, a decrease in exports will reduce aggregate demand, causing the AD curve to shift to the left.\n\n**D. a fall in the government budget deficit**\n\nA fall in the government budget deficit means the gap between government spending (G) and tax revenue (T) is shrinking. This is achieved through contractionary fiscal policy, which involves either a reduction in government spending (G) or an increase in taxes (T), or both. A decrease in G directly reduces a component of aggregate demand. An increase in taxes reduces the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms, leading to lower consumption (C) and investment (I).

Therefore, savers will gain in real terms.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Menu costs will fall to zero.**\nMenu costs are the costs incurred by firms when they have to change their listed prices. These costs exist whenever there is a change in the general price level. In this scenario, the rate of inflation has fallen from 5% to 3%. While a lower rate of inflation might mean that firms need to change their prices less frequently, it does not eliminate the need for price changes altogether. As long as inflation is positive (i.e., prices are still rising, even if slowly), menu costs will still be incurred. They will not fall to zero.\n\n**B: People on fixed incomes will be better off in real terms.**\nPeople on fixed incomes (e.g., pensioners) receive the same nominal amount of money over time. Inflation erodes the purchasing power, or real value, of this income. When the inflation rate was 5%, their real income was falling by 5% per year. After the fall in inflation to 3%, their real income is still falling, but now at a slower rate of 3% per year.

Inflation, which is a rise in the general price level, causes the purchasing power of the currency to fall. For the purchasing power to rise, the economy would need to experience deflation (a negative inflation rate), where the general price level is falling. In this case, the inflation rate is still positive at 3%, meaning prices are still rising.

Microeconomics deals with individual markets and economic agents. Merit goods, such as education and healthcare, are specific goods or services whose consumption is encouraged by the government to correct a perceived market failure (under-consumption). Policies like subsidies or direct provision target the specific market for that good, not the economy as a whole.\n\n**B: reduce pollution in the steel industry**\nThis is a microeconomic policy. It targets a specific problem (a negative externality) within a single industry (the steel industry).

Macroeconomic policies, in contrast, are concerned with economy-wide issues, not the operations of a specific industry.\n\n**D: reduce unemployment in the service sector**\nWhile reducing unemployment is a major macroeconomic goal, this policy is microeconomic in nature because it is targeted at a specific sector of the economy. A macroeconomic policy would aim to reduce the overall, or aggregate, level of unemployment across all sectors, for instance, by stimulating economy-wide demand.

In the short run, this policy exposes domestic firms to greater international competition. Less efficient domestic firms, which were previously shielded by these barriers, may struggle to compete with cheaper or higher-quality imports. As a result, they may be forced to reduce production or even shut down, leading to a fall in domestic real output and an increase in structural unemployment.\n\nHowever, in the long run, this intense competition forces the economy to restructure. Resources, such as labour and capital, are reallocated from the declining, inefficient industries to more productive sectors where the country holds a comparative advantage. This process drives innovation and efficiency gains across the economy, increasing its productive potential and shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. Therefore, real output first decreases due to the initial competitive shock before eventually increasing as a result of improved efficiency and resource allocation.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. increased spending on early years education**\nThis is a long-term, interventionist supply-side policy. Increased government spending on education acts as an injection into the circular flow of income, boosting aggregate demand (AD) and likely increasing real output in the short run. In the long run, it enhances the quality of human capital, leading to a more productive workforce and an increase in the economy's potential output (a rightward shift of the LRAS). At no point does this policy cause an initial fall in real output.\n\n**B. increased spending on infrastructure**\nThis is another interventionist supply-side policy. The spending on construction and development of infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, networks) is a component of government spending (G), which directly increases aggregate demand (AD) and thus raises real output in the short run. In the long run, improved infrastructure reduces production and transport costs for firms, increasing efficiency and shifting the LRAS to the right. This policy increases real output in both the short and long run, without an initial decline.\n\n**D. subsidies to exporters**\nThis is a supply-side policy intended to improve the international competitiveness of domestic firms. The subsidy lowers the costs of production for exporting firms, allowing them to sell their goods at a lower price in foreign markets. This boosts the volume of exports (X), a component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)). The immediate effect is an increase in AD and, consequently, a rise in real output.

This decrease in G causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. The initial equilibrium is at point E, where the aggregate demand curve AD1 intersects the aggregate supply curve AS1. The reduction in government spending shifts the aggregate demand curve from AD1 to AD2. The aggregate supply curve (AS1) remains unchanged, as a change in government spending does not alter the economy's productive capacity in the short run. The new equilibrium is found at the intersection of the new aggregate demand curve (AD2) and the original aggregate supply curve (AS1), which is point A. At this new equilibrium, both the general price level and the level of national income are lower than at the initial equilibrium E.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nPoint B lies on the original aggregate demand curve (AD1) but on a different aggregate supply curve (AS2). This would imply that aggregate demand did not change, but aggregate supply did. A reduction in government spending is a determinant of aggregate demand, causing the AD curve to shift. It does not cause a shift in the aggregate supply curve. Therefore, point B cannot represent the new equilibrium.\n\n#### C\nPoint C is the intersection of the new aggregate demand curve (AD2) and a new aggregate supply curve (AS2). This outcome would require a simultaneous leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve and a change in the aggregate supply curve. The reduction in government spending explains the shift of the AD curve, but there is no economic reason given for the AS curve to change from AS1 to AS2. Thus, point C is not the correct new equilibrium.\n\n#### D\nPoint D is the intersection of the aggregate supply curve AS1 and a third aggregate demand curve, AD3. Like point A, this represents a new equilibrium after a decrease in aggregate demand. However, it corresponds to a much larger leftward shift of the AD curve (from AD1 to AD3). Point A represents the new equilibrium resulting from the specific shift from AD1 to AD2. As point A is a valid outcome representing the economic event described, and is one of the designated points on the diagram, it is the correct answer.\n\n#### E\nPoint E represents the initial equilibrium position of the economy before the change in government policy.

The **labour force** (or economically active population) is composed of those who are employed and those who are unemployed (actively seeking work). Full-time students are typically classified as **economically inactive**, meaning they are not part of the labour force.\n\nIf there is a significant rise in university enrolment, some individuals who were previously employed may leave their jobs to pursue higher education, causing the number of employed people to fall. Similarly, some individuals who were previously unemployed (e.g., recent school-leavers) may choose to enter university instead of continuing to seek employment, causing the number of unemployed people to fall. Because both components of the labour force are shrinking, the overall size of the labour force decreases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: net inward immigration\n\nNet inward immigration refers to a situation where more people are moving into a country to live and work than are leaving. This increases the total working-age population. These new arrivals will either find employment, thus increasing the number of people employed, or they will be looking for work, thus increasing the number of unemployed. In either case, net inward immigration expands the labour force, which is the opposite of the situation described in the question, where a shrinking labour force is implied by the fall in both employment and unemployment.\n\n#### B: an increase in the level of unemployment benefits\n\nAn increase in unemployment benefits raises the opportunity cost of accepting a job. This can reduce the incentive for the unemployed to actively seek or accept work, potentially leading to a rise in the level and duration of unemployment. It might also encourage some economically inactive individuals to start seeking work in order to claim the higher benefits, further swelling the ranks of the unemployed. Therefore, this policy is more likely to increase unemployment, not decrease it.\n\n#### C: an increase in the age at which state pensions are payable\n\nRaising the state pension age means that older workers must remain in the labour force for a longer period before they can retire. This action increases the size of the labour force. Individuals who would have retired will now either remain in their jobs (keeping employment numbers up) or, if they become jobless, will be counted as unemployed (increasing unemployment numbers).

Alternatively, the exporter can lower the foreign currency price of its goods, making them more competitive and potentially increasing sales volume, which also raises revenue.\n\n*   **Effect on Costs:** If the firm relies on domestic suppliers for its inputs, its costs are denominated in the domestic currency. These costs are not directly affected by changes in the exchange rate.\n\nTherefore, a firm that exports its goods and sources its inputs domestically will see its revenues increase while its costs remain largely unchanged, leading to a significant increase in its profit margin.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B: It sells mainly abroad and relies on foreign suppliers for inputs.**\n    While selling abroad would increase revenue in domestic currency terms following a depreciation, relying on foreign suppliers for inputs would simultaneously increase the firm's costs. A weaker domestic currency means that more domestic currency is required to purchase the same amount of imported inputs. The net effect on the firm's profit would be ambiguous, as the gain from higher export revenues could be partially or fully offset by the higher cost of imported inputs.\n\n*   **C: It sells mainly in its home market and relies on domestic suppliers for inputs.**\n    A firm operating entirely within the domestic economy is largely insulated from the direct effects of an exchange rate depreciation. Both its revenues and its costs are denominated in the domestic currency and would not change directly. While there might be an indirect benefit if imported competing goods become more expensive, the firm does not experience a direct gain in its profit margin from the currency movement itself.\n\n*   **D: It sells mainly in its home market and relies on foreign suppliers for inputs.**\n    This scenario is the most detrimental for a firm following a depreciation. The firm's revenue, earned from the home market, would remain unchanged in domestic currency terms. However, its costs would rise because its imported inputs become more expensive. With stable revenues and rising costs, the firm's profit margin would be squeezed, leading to a loss rather than a gain."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_265.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 a country has a floating exchange rate. its current account on the balance of payments moves\nfrom a surplus to a deficit.\nwhich rate is likely to increase in the short run as a consequence of this worsening of its current\naccount?\na economic growth rate\nb_ exchange rate\nc interest rate\nd unemployment rate", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA country's current account balance is a component of its aggregate demand (AD), represented by the formula AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where (X - M) is net exports. A shift from a current account surplus to a deficit signifies that the value of net exports has fallen (either exports have decreased, imports have increased, or a combination of both).\n\nThis decrease in net exports leads to a fall in aggregate demand. A reduction in AD causes a decrease in the country's real output (real GDP). As firms reduce their production levels in response to lower demand, they will require fewer workers. This leads to an increase in cyclical unemployment, meaning the unemployment rate is likely to rise.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: economic growth rate**\n\nA worsening of the current account from a surplus to a deficit means that net exports (X-M), a component of aggregate demand, have decreased. A fall in aggregate demand leads to a slowdown or a contraction in economic activity. This results in a *decrease* in the economic growth rate, not an increase.\n\n**B: exchange rate**\n\nUnder a floating exchange rate system, the value of a currency is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. A current account deficit implies that the supply of the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market (as residents buy foreign goods and services) is greater than the demand for it (from foreigners buying the country's exports). This excess supply puts downward pressure on the currency's value, causing it to depreciate. A depreciation is a *decrease* in the exchange rate, not an increase.\n\n**C: interest rate**\n\nA fall in aggregate demand, resulting from the worsening current account, would likely lead to lower economic growth and reduced inflationary pressure. In response to a slowing economy, a country's central bank would typically implement expansionary monetary policy. This involves *lowering* the interest rate to encourage borrowing, spending, and investment to boost aggregate demand. An increase in the interest rate would be a contractionary policy, which would further dampen economic activity."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_266.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 which policy is most likely to reduce a balance of payments deficit without causing inflation?\na decreased import quotas\nb_ depreciation of currency\nc higher interest rates\nd_ decreased import tariffs", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nRaising interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that can reduce a balance of payments deficit through two main channels, while also controlling inflation.\n\n1.  **Effect on the Balance of Payments:**\n    *   **Current Account:** Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving. This discourages consumption and investment, leading to a fall in aggregate demand. A reduction in overall spending in the economy will include a reduction in spending on imported goods, which improves the current account balance.\n    *   **Financial/Capital Account:** A higher domestic interest rate relative to other countries attracts inflows of short-term capital (often called \"hot money\") from foreign investors seeking better returns on their savings and investments. This inflow of foreign currency is a credit on the financial account, directly improving the overall balance of payments position.\n\n2.  **Effect on Inflation:**\n    *   The primary purpose of raising interest rates is often to combat inflation. By reducing consumption and investment, the policy dampens aggregate demand. A decrease in aggregate demand helps to alleviate demand-pull inflationary pressures, preventing the general price level from rising or even causing it to fall.\n\nTherefore, higher interest rates simultaneously work to reduce the balance of payments deficit and control inflation, making it the most suitable policy among the options.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. decreased import quotas**\n\nA quota is a physical limit on the quantity of goods that can be imported. Decreasing (i.e., tightening) a quota would reduce the volume of imports, which would help to reduce a current account deficit. However, by restricting the supply of imports, it reduces competition for domestic producers and may lead to shortages. This can cause the price of both the imported good and its domestic substitutes to rise, contributing to inflation.\n\n**B. depreciation of currency**\n\nA depreciation of the domestic currency makes exports cheaper for foreigners and imports more expensive for domestic consumers. This can reduce a current account deficit by boosting export demand and reducing import demand (assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds). However, this policy is likely to cause inflation through two mechanisms:\n*   **Demand-pull inflation:** Higher net exports (X-M) increase aggregate demand, which can push up the general price level.\n*   **Cost-push inflation:** The cost of imported raw materials and components rises, increasing production costs for domestic firms, who may then pass these costs on to consumers as higher prices.\n\n**D. decreased import tariffs**\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Decreasing tariffs makes imports cheaper for domestic consumers. This would likely lead to an increase in the quantity of imports demanded, which would worsen the current account deficit, not reduce it. While cheaper imports would help to reduce inflationary pressure by increasing competition and lowering costs for consumers, this policy fails to address the primary objective of reducing the balance of payments deficit."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_267.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 the table shows the average price of exports and imports.\nwhich combination of changes in export prices and import prices could result in a country\u2019s terms\nof trade increasing from 100 to 110?\nthe average price the average price\nof exports of imports\n\na falls by 5% rises by 5%\n\nb remains unchanged rises by 10%\n\ncc rises by 5% falls by 5%\n\nd rises by 10% remains unchanged", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe terms of trade (ToT) measure the ratio of a country's average export prices to its average import prices.

The slope of the PPC represents the opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of the other. The PPC in the diagram is a straight line, which has a constant slope. This indicates that for every additional unit of one good produced, a constant amount of the other good must be sacrificed. Specifically, to produce 50 units of drink, the country must give up 100 units of food. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of drink is always 2 units of food (100 food / 50 drink). This fixed trade-off signifies a constant opportunity cost.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Food and drink are normal goods.**\nA PPC illustrates the production capabilities of an economy; it is a supply-side concept. The classification of a good as 'normal' relates to demand, specifically how the quantity demanded changes in response to a change in consumer income.

The primary advantage of this system is a significant increase in labour productivity, which is the output per worker per unit of time. This occurs for several reasons: workers become highly proficient and faster at their single, repetitive task; time is saved as workers do not need to switch between different tasks and tools; and it allows for the use of specialized machinery dedicated to each stage of production. By breaking down a complex process into simple steps, the overall output of the workforce is increased substantially.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: an increase in labour force creativity**\nThis is incorrect. The division of labour is more likely to stifle creativity rather than enhance it. When workers are confined to performing a single, repetitive, and often monotonous task, there is little scope for innovation, problem-solving, or creative input. The focus is on standardization and efficiency in a predefined process, not on developing new methods.\n\n**C: an increase in workforce flexibility**\nThis is incorrect. The division of labour typically reduces workforce flexibility. Because each worker is highly specialized in one particular task, they often lack the skills and training to perform other jobs within the production process. This makes it difficult to reallocate labour in response to production changes or to cover for absent colleagues, leading to a more rigid, less adaptable workforce.\n\n**D: an increase in worker satisfaction**\nThis is incorrect. A well-documented disadvantage of the division of labour is a potential decrease in worker satisfaction. The repetitive and monotonous nature of specialized tasks can lead to boredom, alienation, and a feeling of being a small, unimportant part of the overall process. This lack of variety and challenge can significantly reduce morale and job satisfaction."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_275.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "5 a government wishes to encourage the consumption of a merit good and reduce the consumption\nof a demerit good.\nwhich policy should it adopt towards each good?\na impose a minimum price produce only in the public sector\nb increase advertising on the benefits put legal controls on output\nof the good\ncc confine access to certain age groups tax output\nd subsidise the good set a minimum level of output", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA government aims to increase the consumption of merit goods and decrease the consumption of demerit goods to correct market failure and align consumption with the socially optimal level.\n\n*   **Merit Good Policy:** Increasing advertising on the benefits of a merit good addresses the information failure that often leads to its under-consumption. Merit goods, such as education or vaccinations, have positive externalities and long-term benefits that consumers may not fully appreciate. Government-funded advertising campaigns can raise awareness, increase the perceived private benefit for consumers, and shift the demand curve to the right, thereby encouraging higher consumption.\n*   **Demerit Good Policy:** Putting legal controls on the output of a demerit good, such as setting a production quota, directly restricts its supply. Demerit goods, like cigarettes or high-sugar drinks, are over-consumed because their negative externalities and long-term private costs are not fully considered by consumers. By limiting the quantity that can be produced and sold, the government shifts the supply curve to the left.

Imposing a minimum price (a price floor) on a merit good would make it more expensive, which, according to the law of demand, would decrease the quantity demanded and discourage consumption. This contradicts the government's objective.

This leads to a decrease in the supply of leather shoes, causing their equilibrium price to rise. Substitute goods are products that consumers can use in place of one another. As leather shoes become more expensive, consumers will switch to relatively cheaper alternatives, such as shoes made from high-quality synthetic materials.

The demand curve for leather shoes will shift to the left.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A change in the price of an input (leather) is a determinant of **supply**, not demand. It affects the producers' cost and willingness to supply leather shoes at each price. The demand curve for leather shoes would only shift due to changes in non-price determinants of demand, such as consumer income, tastes, or the price of related goods. The increase in the price of leather shoes that results from the supply change will cause a decrease in the *quantity demanded* (a movement along the demand curve), not a shift of the entire curve to the left.\n\n**C. The supply curve for leather shoes will shift to the right.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A rightward shift of the supply curve indicates an *increase* in supply. However, a rise in the price of an input like leather increases the cost of production.

The supply curve for a substitute for leather to make expensive shoes will shift to the right.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The scenario describes a change in the market for leather itself, not in the market for its substitutes (e.g., synthetic materials). A shift in the supply curve for a substitute material would be caused by a change in its own determinants of supply, such as a change in the technology to produce it or a change in the cost of its raw materials.

Therefore, private house prices would be expected to increase.\n\nSimultaneously, the scenario states that the increased demand for private houses is \"replacing demand for apartments rented from the state.\" This indicates that private houses and rented apartments are substitute goods. As consumers shift their preference towards owning houses, the demand for renting apartments decreases.

An increase in demand, stemming from the removal of ownership restrictions, would lead to higher, not lower, prices. While it correctly identifies that apartment rents would decrease, the initial premise is flawed.\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect on both counts.

Non-excludability means that once the good is provided, it is impossible to prevent individuals from benefiting from it, even if they have not paid. This leads to the **free-rider problem**, where individuals have an incentive to consume the good without contributing to its cost, hoping others will pay for it. If everyone acts this way, the private market will fail to provide the good, or will under-provide it, even if its social benefit is greater than its cost.\n\nThe most effective solution to this market failure is the **direct provision by the government**. The government can finance the public good (e.g., national defense, street lighting) through compulsory taxation. By forcing all citizens (or all beneficiaries) to contribute via taxes, the government overcomes the free-rider problem. It ensures that the good is funded and provided for the benefit of society, correcting the under-provision that would occur in a free market.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an advertising campaign:** An advertising campaign relies on persuading individuals to voluntarily contribute to the provision of the public good. While this may generate some funds, it does not solve the underlying economic incentive to free ride. Rational individuals may still choose not to pay, relying on the contributions of others. Therefore, this approach is unlikely to raise sufficient funds to provide the good at the socially optimal level.\n\n**C. a minimum price:** A minimum price, or price floor, is a government-imposed price set above the market equilibrium. This policy is used for private goods to ensure producers receive a certain price. It is completely inapplicable to public goods because the core of the free-rider problem is the inability to charge *any* price due to the non-excludable nature of the good. Setting a minimum price for something that cannot be sold in the first place is an ineffective and irrelevant policy.\n\n**D. a tax on a substitute good:** Taxing a substitute good would make the alternative private good more expensive, which might increase the demand or desire for the public good. However, this policy does nothing to solve the funding and provision issue. Consumers would still have no incentive to pay for the public good, even if they want it more.

When interest rates are very low, the returns on these savings fall significantly, leading to a direct decrease in their disposable income.\n*   **Increase in Wealth:** The scenario specifies that low interest rates cause a large increase in house prices.

According to the law of demand, a lower price for a good or service (in this case, capital equipment) leads to an increase in the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. Therefore, the farm will be incentivised to use more capital equipment.\n\nThe problem states that labour and capital equipment are substitutes. This means that the firm can replace one factor with the other in the production process. As the subsidy makes capital equipment relatively cheaper compared to labour, the firm will substitute the now cheaper factor (capital) for the relatively more expensive factor (labour) to minimise its production costs. This is known as the substitution effect. Consequently, the quantity of labour employed will decrease.\n\nThus, the policy results in an increase in the quantity of capital equipment and a decrease in the quantity of labour.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because a subsidy lowers the cost of capital equipment, which would lead to an increase in its use, not a decrease. Firms respond to lower input prices by increasing their demand for that input.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly reverses the effects on both factors.

Deflation is a decrease in the general price level. An annual deflation rate of 2% means that prices, on average, are 2% lower at the end of the year than they were at the beginning.\n\nWhen this occurs for four successive years, the 2% decrease in each subsequent year is calculated on a new, already lower, price level. This compounding effect means the total percentage decrease over the four years will be less than the simple sum of the annual rates (4 years \u00d7 2% = 8%).\n\nTo illustrate, assume the initial price level is 100:\n*   **End of Year 1:** 100 \u00d7 (1 - 0.02) = 98\n*   **End of Year 2:** 98 \u00d7 (1 - 0.02) = 96.04\n*   **End of Year 3:** 96.04 \u00d7 (1 - 0.02) = 94.1192\n*   **End of Year 4:** 94.1192 \u00d7 (1 - 0.02) \u2248 92.24\n\nThe total fall in the price level is 100 - 92.24 = 7.76.\nThe total percentage fall is (7.76 / 100) \u00d7 100 = 7.76%.\nSince 7.76% is less than 8%, the correct statement is that the price level fell by less than 8%.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The price level fell by 8%.**\nThis is incorrect because it is calculated by simply multiplying the annual rate by the number of years (2% \u00d7 4 = 8%). This method fails to account for the compounding effect. Each year, the 2% deflation is applied to a progressively smaller base price level. As shown in the calculation above, the actual total decrease is 7.76%, which is less than 8%.\n\n**C: The real value of money fell by 8%.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, deflation causes the real value of money to *increase*, not fall. The real value of money refers to its purchasing power. When the price level falls (deflation), each unit of currency can buy more goods and services, meaning its real value rises. Secondly, as explained for option A, the magnitude of the change would not be 8% due to the compounding effect.\n\n**D: The real value of money fell by less than 8%.**\nThis statement is incorrect because, during a period of deflation, the real value (or purchasing power) of money increases. As the general price level of goods and services decreases, a given amount of money can purchase more than it could previously.

If I is not equal to S, it is still possible for the national income to be in equilibrium.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The condition for equilibrium in the circular flow of income is that total injections into the economy must equal total leakages (withdrawals) from it.\n\n*   **Injections** are forms of spending that originate from outside the core circular flow between households and firms. They are Investment (I), Government Expenditure (G), and Exports (X).\n*   **Leakages** are parts of income that are not passed on as spending within the core circular flow. They are Saving (S), Taxation (T), and Imports (M).\n\nThe equilibrium condition is therefore:\n**Injections = Leakages**\n**I + G + X = S + T + M**\n\nThis equation shows that it is the sum of all injections that must equal the sum of all leakages. It does not require that each individual injection must equal its corresponding leakage (e.g., I=S, G=T, or X=M). For instance, an economy can be in equilibrium if a shortfall of investment relative to saving (I < S) is exactly offset by a government budget deficit (G > T) and/or a trade surplus (X > M). As long as the total values on both sides of the equation are equal, the national income is stable and in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. At equilibrium, the levels of Y and C are always the same.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. National income (Y) represents the total income earned by households. This income is allocated to three uses: Consumption (C), Saving (S), and paying Taxes (T). This relationship is expressed by the equation: **Y = C + S + T**. Since both saving (S) and taxation (T) are typically positive values in an economy, national income (Y) will be greater than consumption (C). Consumption is only a component, albeit the largest one, of national income.\n\n**B. Governments always adjust G so that the economy is in equilibrium.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While governments use fiscal policy, which includes adjusting government expenditure (G), to influence the level of aggregate demand and move the economy towards a desired equilibrium (such as full employment), they do not and cannot \"always\" ensure the economy is in equilibrium. There are several reasons for this:\n*   **Time Lags:** There are significant delays in recognising economic problems, deciding on a course of action, and implementing policy changes.\n*   **Imperfect Information:** Governments operate with incomplete and often lagging data, making precise adjustments difficult.\n*   **Other Policy Objectives:** Governments have multiple objectives, such as controlling inflation, reducing debt, or funding specific public services, which may conflict with the goal of maintaining short-run income equilibrium.\nTherefore, an economy can remain in a state of disequilibrium (e.g., experiencing a recessionary or inflationary gap) for considerable periods.\n\n**D. If the national income is in equilibrium, X must be equal to M.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As explained for option C, the equilibrium condition is that total injections equal total leakages (**I + G + X = S + T + M**).

It is a natural and unavoidable part of a dynamic economy, reflecting the time it takes for workers to search for new employment opportunities that best match their skills and preferences, and for employers to find suitable candidates. A rise in the number of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs to look for new ones directly increases the pool of individuals who are temporarily between jobs, thereby causing a rise in the level of frictional unemployment. This often happens when the economy is strong and workers are confident they can find better positions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** An economy moving into a period of recession leads to a rise in cyclical unemployment, not frictional unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is caused by a downturn in the business cycle and a deficiency in aggregate demand. During a recession, firms reduce output and lay off workers, leading to involuntary unemployment, which is distinct from the voluntary, search-based nature of frictional unemployment.\n\n**B:** The replacement of workers with computers represents technological change that can lead to structural unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills that workers possess and the skills that employers demand. When technology like computers makes certain job roles obsolete, the workers who previously held those roles may lack the new skills required for available jobs, resulting in long-term unemployment until they can be retrained. This is a structural issue, not a frictional one.\n\n**C:** A large-scale change from an agriculturally based economy to an industrial one is a major economic transformation that causes structural unemployment. As the economy shifts, the demand for agricultural labour falls while the demand for industrial labour rises. The skills required in factories are vastly different from those used in farming. This fundamental mismatch between the skills of the existing workforce and the needs of the new industries leads to structural unemployment, not the short-term, transitional unemployment classified as frictional."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_288.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "18 the information shows data from a country\u2019s national income accounts.\nston\ngross domestic product at market prices 200 000\ngross value added at basic prices 180000\nsubsidies 5000\ncapital consumption 30000\nwhat can be concluded from the income accounts?\nnet domestic product a\n: indirect tax revenue\nat market prices ~\n$ million smilllion\na 170000 15000\nb 170000 25000\ncc 150000 15000\nd 150000 25000", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis conclusion is derived from two key calculations based on national income accounting principles.\n\n1.  **Net Domestic Product (NDP) at market prices:** This is calculated by subtracting capital consumption (depreciation) from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at market prices.

The value for Net Domestic Product (NDP) at market prices is wrong. The figure of $150,000 million is likely the result of incorrectly subtracting capital consumption from Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices ($180,000m - $30,000m) rather than from GDP at market prices.

The aggregate supply (AS) curve is steep or vertical in this region. The government expenditure on the hospital will cause a significant increase in aggregate demand (AD). Because the economy has very little spare capacity to increase output, this surge in demand will \"pull\" the price level up, causing significant **demand-pull inflation**.\n\n2.  **High Imports of Expensive Materials:** Importing a high volume of expensive raw materials increases the costs of production for the hospital project. This is a form of **cost-push inflation**. An increase in the cost of key imported inputs will cause the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to shift to the left. This shift, independent of the change in AD, also pushes the general price level higher.\n\nThe combination of a rightward shift in AD (from government spending) along a steep AS curve and a leftward shift in the SRAS curve (from high import costs) creates the most intense upward pressure on the price level.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: High imports of materials and high unemployment**\n\nWith high unemployment, the economy has significant spare capacity, meaning the AS curve is relatively flat. While the high cost of imports would cause some cost-push inflation (shifting SRAS left), the increase in aggregate demand from the hospital project would primarily lead to an increase in real output and employment rather than a large increase in the price level. The slack in the labour market would also suppress wage pressures, mitigating the overall inflationary impact.\n\n**C: Low imports of materials and high unemployment**\n\nIn this scenario, high unemployment means the economy has substantial spare capacity (a flat AS curve). Low imports mean that a larger portion of the government spending is on domestic goods and services, causing a relatively large rightward shift in the AD curve. However, because the economy is operating far below full capacity, this increase in demand will be met by increasing production and hiring unemployed resources, leading to a significant rise in real GDP but only a small increase in the price level.\n\n**D: Low imports of materials and low unemployment**\n\nThis scenario would lead to significant demand-pull inflation. Low unemployment means the AS curve is steep, and low imports mean the government spending creates a large increase in domestic aggregate demand. The combination of a large AD shift and a steep AS curve will certainly increase the price level. However, this option only includes demand-pull inflation.

This is because the rate of return on these assets is lower compared to other countries. Consequently, there will likely be an outflow of 'hot money' (short-term speculative capital) as investors sell the domestic currency to buy foreign currencies. The increased supply of the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market leads to a depreciation of its value. When the domestic currency depreciates, its exports become cheaper for foreign buyers, as they need less of their own currency to purchase the same amount of goods. Therefore, a reduction in interest rates is most likely to cause a decrease in export prices when measured in foreign currency terms.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. borrowing by firms**\n\nThis is incorrect. Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing. When interest rates are reduced, it becomes cheaper for firms to take out loans to finance investment in new capital, technology, or expansion. This lower cost of credit acts as an incentive for firms to increase their level of borrowing, not decrease it.\n\n**B. consumer spending**\n\nThis is incorrect. A reduction in interest rates typically leads to an increase in consumer spending. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, the cost of borrowing for consumers on items such as mortgages, car loans, and credit cards falls, making it more attractive to finance large purchases. Secondly, the reward for saving money in banks is reduced, which diminishes the incentive for consumers to save and encourages them to spend their disposable income instead.\n\n**C. import prices**\n\nThis is incorrect. A reduction in interest rates tends to cause the domestic currency to depreciate due to capital outflows. A weaker currency means that more of the domestic currency is required to purchase the same amount of foreign currency. As a result, goods and services imported from other countries become more expensive in domestic currency terms.

Reduced government infrastructure spending reduces an economy's LRAS and has a short-term expansionary effect on AD.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because its description of the effect on aggregate demand (AD) is flawed. While a reduction in government infrastructure spending can harm an economy's long-run productive capacity, it has a contractionary, not an expansionary, effect on aggregate demand.\n\n*   **Effect on Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS):** Infrastructure, such as transportation and communication networks, is a critical component of a nation's capital stock. A sustained reduction in infrastructure spending can lead to its depreciation, increasing business costs, reducing efficiency, and ultimately lowering the economy's potential output. This would cause the LRAS curve to shift to the left or grow more slowly. The first part of the statement is therefore plausible.\n*   **Effect on Aggregate Demand (AD):** Government spending (G) is a direct component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)). A *reduction* in government spending directly decreases AD, causing the AD curve to shift to the left. This is a *contractionary* or *deflationary* fiscal policy. The statement incorrectly claims it has an expansionary effect.\n\nBecause a reduction in government spending is contractionary for aggregate demand, the entire statement is incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Increased government spending supporting technical progress has beneficial long-term supply-side effects but may have short-term inflationary consequences.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Government spending on research and development (R&D) or subsidies for innovation are interventionist supply-side policies.\n*   **Long-term supply-side effect:** This spending promotes technological advancements, which increase productivity and the economy's potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the right.\n*   **Short-term demand-side effect:** The spending itself is an injection into the circular flow of income, increasing aggregate demand (AD). If the economy is operating near its full capacity, this increase in AD can lead to demand-pull inflation in the short term, before the long-term supply-side benefits are realised.\n\n**B.

Reduced rates of tax on higher incomes increases an economy's LRAS and has an expansionary effect on AD.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Reducing income tax rates is a market-based supply-side policy.\n*   **Long-term supply-side effect:** The policy is intended to create incentives. Lower taxes on higher incomes may encourage entrepreneurship, saving, and investment. They may also incentivise individuals to work longer or harder. These effects can increase the economy's productive capacity, shifting the LRAS curve to the right.\n*   **Short-term demand-side effect:** A tax cut increases the disposable income of households.

Lowering this threshold means that individuals with very low incomes, who previously paid no tax, will now be required to pay income tax. This increases the tax burden disproportionately on the poorest workers, making the tax system more regressive.\n2.  **A fall in the rate of inheritance tax:** Inheritance tax is a tax on the transfer of wealth, typically levied on large estates passed on after death. As significant wealth is predominantly held by higher-income households, this tax primarily affects the rich. A reduction in the inheritance tax rate allows the wealthy to pass on a larger proportion of their assets, thereby increasing the concentration of wealth and exacerbating wealth inequality.\n\nThe combination of these two policies harms low-income earners while benefiting the wealthy, leading to a more unequal distribution of income and wealth, which is the definition of a regressive outcome.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: a fall in the charge made for visits to a doctor and a rise in the level of unemployment benefit**\nThis policy combination is progressive, not regressive. A fixed charge for a doctor's visit is regressive, as it represents a much larger proportion of a low-income person's income. Reducing this charge therefore benefits the poor proportionally more. Similarly, raising unemployment benefits is a direct transfer payment to those with little or no income, making the distribution of income more equal. Both measures are progressive.\n\n**C: a rise in the rate of income tax charged at higher levels of income and a rise in the standard rate of corporation tax**\nThis policy combination is progressive. Increasing the tax rate for high-income earners is a classic example of a progressive tax policy, as it takes a larger percentage of income from the rich. A rise in corporation tax, which is a tax on company profits, is also generally considered progressive, as the burden tends to fall on the owners of capital (shareholders), who are typically wealthier individuals. Both policies aim to redistribute income from the top to the bottom.\n\n**D: a rise in the standard rate of income tax and a fall in the standard rate of goods and services tax**\nThis policy combination is likely to be progressive overall. Goods and Services Tax (GST), or Value Added Tax (VAT), is an indirect tax on consumption. It is considered regressive because low-income households spend a larger proportion of their income on essential goods and services compared to high-income households (who save a larger proportion). Therefore, a fall in the GST rate benefits the poor more in proportional terms, making the fiscal system more progressive. While a rise in the standard rate of income tax could have mixed effects depending on the overall structure, the significant progressive impact of the GST reduction makes it highly unlikely that the overall policy would be regressive."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_293.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 what does it mean when a government has a budget surplus?\na government revenue exceeds expenditure.\nb_ imports exceed exports.\nc_ the government has an expansionary fiscal policy.\nd_ the national debt is increasing.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA government budget surplus occurs when the total government revenue is greater than the total government expenditure over a specific fiscal period. Government revenue primarily consists of tax collections (e.g., income tax, corporation tax, value-added tax) and other income like fees and profits from state-owned enterprises. Government expenditure includes all spending on public services, such as healthcare, education, defence, social security, and infrastructure projects. When revenue exceeds this expenditure, the government has a positive fiscal balance, known as a budget surplus.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Imports exceed exports.**\nThis statement describes a trade deficit, also known as a negative balance of trade. This concept relates to a country's international transactions in goods and services and is a component of the current account of the balance of payments. It is distinct from the government's fiscal position, which is concerned with its own revenue and spending, not the country's overall trade flows. A country can have a government budget surplus while simultaneously running a trade deficit, or vice versa.\n\n**C. The government has an expansionary fiscal policy.**\nAn expansionary fiscal policy involves the government deliberately increasing its expenditure or decreasing taxation to stimulate aggregate demand and economic growth. Both of these actions tend to move the government's budget towards a deficit (where expenditure exceeds revenue) or reduce the size of an existing surplus. A budget surplus is more commonly associated with a contractionary (or deflationary) fiscal policy, where the government reduces its spending or increases taxes to cool down an overheating economy or reduce national debt.\n\n**D. The national debt is increasing.**\nThe national debt is the cumulative total of all past government borrowing. It increases when the government runs a budget deficit, as it must borrow money to finance the shortfall between its expenditure and revenue. Conversely, a budget surplus means the government has excess funds. These funds can be used to pay back previous borrowings, thereby *decreasing* the national debt. Therefore, a budget surplus is associated with a reduction in the national debt, not an increase."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_294.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "24 acountry subsidises domestic production of manufactured goods.\nwhat is the most likely outcome?\na arise in economic growth\nb_ arise in imports of manufactured goods\nc arise in the rate of inflation\nd_ arise in unemployment", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA subsidy is a government payment to domestic producers that effectively lowers their costs of production. By reducing production costs, the subsidy incentivises domestic firms to increase their output of manufactured goods. This increase in the production of goods and services leads to a rise in the country's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Economic growth is defined as an increase in the real GDP of an economy over time. Therefore, the most direct and likely outcome of subsidising domestic production is a rise in economic growth. This policy can be viewed as a supply-side measure that shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right, leading to higher national output.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B a rise in imports of manufactured goods**\n\nA subsidy makes domestically produced goods cheaper for consumers relative to foreign-produced goods. As a result, domestic consumers will likely substitute away from more expensive imports and purchase the now cheaper domestic alternatives. This change in consumer behaviour will lead to a *decrease*, not an increase, in the quantity of imported manufactured goods.\n\n**C a rise in the rate of inflation**\n\nThe effect of a subsidy on inflation is ambiguous, making it not the most likely outcome. There are two opposing effects. On one hand, the subsidy is a form of government spending, which increases aggregate demand and can put upward pressure on the price level. On the other hand, the subsidy lowers firms' production costs, which shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right, putting downward pressure on the price level. The net effect on inflation depends on the relative magnitude of these shifts, but a primary effect is a lower price for the subsidised goods themselves, making widespread inflation less certain than the increase in output.\n\n**D a rise in unemployment**\n\nTo increase the domestic production of manufactured goods, firms will need to utilise more factors of production, including labour. The increased demand for workers in the manufacturing sector will lead to the creation of jobs.

The overall balance of payments (the sum of the current, capital, and financial accounts, plus net errors and omissions) must, by definition, equal zero. A deficit in one account (e.g., the current account) is automatically offset by a surplus in the other accounts (e.g., the financial and capital accounts). While this is true, it merely describes the statistical reality of how a deficit is financed; it does not provide a reason or justification for a government's decision to allow that deficit to continue. The government's decision is based on the perceived sustainability and consequences of the deficit, not on the accounting rule itself.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Foreign direct investment might help to finance the deficit.**\nThis is a valid explanation. A current account deficit implies a net outflow of funds for goods, services, and income. This must be financed by a net inflow of funds on the capital and financial accounts. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major component of the financial account. If a country is attracting significant and stable FDI, these capital inflows can finance the current account deficit. A government might allow the deficit to continue if it is being financed by such long-term, productive investment, as FDI can also enhance the country's economic growth potential.\n\n**C. The country may have a larger surplus on the other parts of its balance of payments account.**\nThis is a valid explanation. For the overall balance of payments to balance, a current account deficit must be matched by a combined surplus on the capital and financial accounts. If a country can easily attract capital from abroad\u2014for example, through portfolio investments or other financial flows\u2014it can run a large financial account surplus. This surplus effectively pays for the current account deficit. A government may be comfortable with a current account deficit if it is confident in the country's ability to continue attracting these financial inflows to maintain a surplus on the other accounts.\n\n**D. The standard of living is increased if the level of cheap food imports is significant.**\nThis is a valid explanation. A current account deficit means a country's spending on imports is greater than its earnings from exports. If these imports include a high volume of cheap essential goods, such as food and consumer products, this can lower the domestic price level and increase the real purchasing power of consumers. This access to cheaper goods can lead to a higher material standard of living. A government might, therefore, tolerate a current account deficit to avoid imposing protectionist measures (like tariffs) that would raise prices for consumers and potentially lower their standard of living."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_296.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "26 acountry currently producing at point x on its production possibility curve decides to specialise in\nthe manufacture of cars and import trucks. it finds it can import one truck in exchange for four\ncars.\n\n2000\ntrucks si\n1000\n0\n0 5000 10000\ncars\nwhat is the result in the domestic market if it exports all the extra cars?\na 250 extra trucks\nb 1000 extra trucks\nc 1250 extra trucks\nd 2000 extra trucks", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nBy specialising in the production of cars and engaging in international trade, the country can consume a combination of goods that lies beyond its own production possibility curve (PPC).\n\n1.  **Initial Production:** The country is initially at point X, producing 5,000 cars and 1,000 trucks.\n2.  **Specialisation:** The country specialises in the manufacture of cars.

This encourages domestic consumers and firms to switch their expenditure towards imports, causing the quantity of imports demanded to rise. The combination of falling export revenue and rising import expenditure will worsen the current account balance, making a deficit more likely.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a recession in the domestic economy**\nA recession is a period of declining economic activity, which leads to a fall in national income and overall spending. As incomes fall, domestic consumers and firms reduce their spending on all goods and services, including imports. This decrease in demand for imports would improve the current account balance (by reducing the outflow of money), moving it towards a surplus or a smaller deficit. Therefore, a recession is likely to reduce a current account deficit, not cause one.\n\n**C. an undervalued exchange rate**\nAn undervalued exchange rate means the domestic currency is cheaper in terms of foreign currencies. This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, increasing their international competitiveness and boosting the volume of exports. Conversely, it makes imports more expensive for domestic buyers, leading to a fall in the volume of imports. Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds (which states that the sum of the price elasticities of demand for exports and imports is greater than one), the increase in export revenue and decrease in import expenditure will improve the current account balance, leading to a surplus, not a deficit.\n\n**D. high labour productivity**\nHigh labour productivity means that more output is produced per worker. This typically leads to lower average costs of production for domestic firms. Lower costs allow firms to charge more competitive prices for their goods and services. As a result, the country's exports become more attractive on the world market, leading to an increase in export volume. At the same time, domestically produced goods become more price-competitive against imports, leading to a fall in import demand. Both effects would improve the current account balance, pushing it towards a surplus."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_298.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 two statements describing forms of protectionism a government can use are listed.\n1 there is a total ban on imports.\n2 allimported goods have to be of a specified standard.\nwhich combination correctly describes these two statements?\n[statement [statement 2\na administrative barrier import quota\nb administrative barrier embargo\ncc embargo administrative barrier\nd embargo import quota", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Statement 1** describes an **embargo**. An embargo is a government order that restricts commerce or exchange with a specified country or on specific goods. It represents the most extreme form of trade barrier, constituting a complete ban on imports (or exports).\n\n**Statement 2** describes an **administrative barrier**. These are a type of non-tariff barrier to trade where a country uses regulations, such as product standards, safety requirements, or complex customs procedures, to make it difficult or costly for foreign producers to import their goods. Requiring imported goods to meet a \"specified standard\" is a classic example of an administrative barrier, as it can be used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition under the guise of safety or quality control.\n\nTherefore, the combination that correctly describes both statements is embargo and administrative barrier.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it misidentifies both statements. An administrative barrier (statement 2) is a regulation, not a total ban on imports (statement 1). An import quota is a physical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported, which is different from requiring goods to meet a specific quality or safety standard.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect. Statement 1 describes an embargo, not an administrative barrier. Conversely, statement 2 describes an administrative barrier, not an embargo. The terms have been incorrectly assigned to the statements.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it misidentifies statement 2. While statement 1 is correctly identified as an embargo, statement 2 does not describe an import quota. An import quota restricts the *quantity* of imports, whereas a specified standard is a *qualitative* regulation concerning the characteristics of the product itself, which is a form of administrative barrier."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_299.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "29 when is there an improvement in a country\u2019s terms of trade?\na_ when the price of exports falls more than the price of imports\nb_ when there is no change in the price of exports but a fall in the price of imports\nc_ when the value of exports increases relative to the total value of imports\nd_ when the volume of exports increases relative to the total volume of imports", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. when there is no change in the price of exports but a fall in the price of imports**\n\nAn improvement in a country's terms of trade occurs when the ratio of its export prices to its import prices increases. The terms of trade are calculated as an index:\n\nTerms of Trade Index = (Index of Average Export Prices / Index of Average Import Prices) \u00d7 100\n\nAn \"improvement\" means this index value rises. This signifies that for every unit of exports sold, a country can now purchase a greater quantity of imports.\n\nIn the scenario described in option B, the price of exports (the numerator in the formula) remains constant, while the price of imports (the denominator) decreases. A decrease in the denominator of a fraction, while the numerator is held constant, will cause the value of the overall fraction to increase. Therefore, this leads to an improvement in the terms of trade, enhancing the country's purchasing power on international markets.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. when the price of exports falls more than the price of imports**\n\nThis scenario describes a **worsening (or deterioration)** of the terms of trade, not an improvement. If the average price of exports (the numerator) falls by a larger percentage than the average price of imports (the denominator), the resulting ratio will be smaller. A lower terms of trade index means the country must export a larger volume of goods to afford the same quantity of imports as before, reducing its international purchasing power.\n\n**C. when the value of exports increases relative to the total value of imports**\n\nThis statement describes an improvement in the **balance of trade**, not the terms of trade. The terms of trade are concerned with the relative *prices* of exports and imports. The balance of trade, in contrast, is concerned with the total *value* (Price \u00d7 Quantity) of exports and imports. It is possible for the terms of trade to worsen (e.g., export prices fall) while the balance of trade improves (if the volume of exports increases sufficiently to more than offset the price fall). These are distinct economic concepts.\n\n**D. when the volume of exports increases relative to the total volume of imports**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the terms of trade are a measure based on relative **prices**, not relative **volumes** (quantities). While changes in the volume of goods traded are crucial for analysing the balance of trade and a country's overall economic performance, they do not define the terms of trade. The terms of trade specifically isolate the price relationship between what a country sells and what it buys on the international market."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p1_300.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "30 what is likely to happen if there is a rise in the international value of a country\u2019s currency?\na _afall in the foreign currency price of its exports\nba fall in the volume of its exports\nc_ arise in the domestic currency price of its imports\nd_ arise in the domestic price level", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA rise in the international value of a country's currency, known as an appreciation, means that each unit of the domestic currency can now purchase more units of a foreign currency. This makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers when priced in their own currency. According to the law of demand, an increase in price typically leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded. Therefore, foreigners will likely purchase a smaller quantity, or volume, of the country's exports.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a fall in the foreign currency price of its exports**\nThis is incorrect. When the domestic currency appreciates, exports become *more* expensive for foreign buyers, not less. For example, if a UK product costs \u00a3100 and the exchange rate moves from \u00a31 = $1.20 to \u00a31 = $1.30, the price for a US buyer increases from $120 to $130. The foreign currency price of the export has risen.\n\n**C. a rise in the domestic currency price of its imports**\nThis is incorrect. A currency appreciation makes imports *cheaper* in the domestic currency. This is because the stronger domestic currency can be exchanged for more foreign currency, allowing it to purchase more imported goods for the same amount of domestic money. For instance, if a US product costs $120, and the exchange rate moves from \u00a31 = $1.20 to \u00a31 = $1.30, the cost for a UK buyer falls from \u00a3100 to approximately \u00a392.31.\n\n**D. a rise in the domestic price level**\nThis is incorrect. A rise in the value of the currency is more likely to cause a *fall* in the domestic price level (deflation) or a slowing of its rate of increase (disinflation). This is for two main reasons. Firstly, imports become cheaper, which lowers the cost of imported consumer goods and raw materials for domestic producers, reducing cost-push inflationary pressures. Secondly, the likely fall in export demand and rise in import demand will reduce net exports (X-M), which is a component of aggregate demand (AD). A fall in AD tends to put downward pressure on the general price level."}]
