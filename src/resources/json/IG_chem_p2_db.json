The solid purple crystal (the solute) breaks apart into individual particles which then mix with the water (the solvent). This forms a homogeneous mixture called a solution. The visual evidence for this is the disappearance of the solid crystal.\n2.  **Diffusing:** After the crystal dissolves, the purple particles are initially concentrated at the bottom of the beaker. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, driven by the random motion of particles. Over time, the purple particles spread out until they are evenly distributed throughout the water, resulting in a uniformly coloured purple solution.\n3.  **No Chemical Reaction:** This process is a physical change, not a chemical reaction. No new chemical substances are formed. The original purple substance is still present, merely dispersed in the water. If the water were to be evaporated, the purple crystals could be recovered.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n*   **A**: This option is incorrect because dissolving is a key process that occurs, which this option omits. Furthermore, the change is physical, not a chemical reaction, as no new substances are formed.\n\n*   **B**: This option is incorrect because both dissolving and diffusing are fundamental processes in this experiment. Dissolving is the breakdown of the crystal into the water, and diffusion is the subsequent spreading of the particles. Also, this is a physical change, not a chemical reaction.\n\n*   **C**: This option is incorrect because it fails to include diffusion. Dissolving alone would result in a concentrated layer of purple solution at the bottom of the beaker.

These electrons are involved in forming chemical bonds. Isotopes are atoms of the same element, which means they have the same number of protons (the same atomic number). In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Therefore, all isotopes of a given element have the same number of electrons and thus the same electron configuration, including the same number of outer shell electrons. This identical electron structure causes them to exhibit the same chemical behaviour.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. They have the same number of neutrons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. By definition, isotopes of an element are atoms that have the same number of protons but **different** numbers of neutrons. This difference in neutron number is what distinguishes one isotope from another (e.g., Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, while Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons).\n\n**C. They have different numbers of protons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is its atomic number, which defines the element. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons. If atoms had different numbers of protons, they would be different elements, not isotopes of the same element.\n\n**D.

This type of bonding occurs between non-metal atoms. Methane (CH\u2084) consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, both of which are non-metals.\n\nIn the formation of a single covalent bond, each participating atom contributes one electron to form a shared pair. The primary reason atoms form bonds is to achieve a stable electronic configuration, which is typically that of a noble gas (a full outer electron shell).\n\nIn methane:\n*   A carbon atom has 4 valence electrons. It requires 4 more electrons to achieve the stable electron configuration of neon (2,8).\n*   A hydrogen atom has 1 valence electron. It requires 1 more electron to achieve the stable electron configuration of helium (2).\n\nBy forming four single covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms, the carbon atom shares a total of 8 electrons, thus attaining a noble gas structure. Each hydrogen atom shares 2 electrons with the carbon atom, also attaining a noble gas structure. Therefore, the formation of covalent bonds in methane involves the sharing of electron pairs, resulting in both atoms achieving a noble gas electronic structure.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\nThe first part of this statement, \"atoms share a pair of electrons,\" correctly describes the fundamental nature of a single covalent bond. However, the second part, \"both atoms have the same number of electrons in their outer shell,\" is incorrect for methane.\n\nAfter bonding in methane (CH\u2084), the central carbon atom shares eight electrons in its outer shell, achieving the stable electronic structure of neon. In contrast, each hydrogen atom shares two electrons in its outer shell, achieving the stable electronic structure of helium. Since the carbon atom has eight outer shell electrons and each hydrogen atom has two, they do not have the same number of electrons in their outer shells.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: C**\nThe statement \"electrons are transferred from one atom to another\" describes the formation of an ionic bond, not a covalent bond. Ionic bonding involves the complete transfer of one or more electrons from a metal atom to a non-metal atom, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions (a cation and an anion).\n\nMethane (CH\u2084) is a simple molecular compound formed between two non-metals (carbon and hydrogen). Bonding between non-metal atoms involves the sharing of electrons to form covalent bonds, not the transfer of electrons. Therefore, this description of bond formation is incorrect for methane.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option C, the statement \"electrons are transferred from one atom to another\" describes ionic bonding, whereas methane is a covalently bonded molecule where electrons are shared.\n\nSecondly, the statement \"both atoms have the same number of electrons in their outer shell\" is also incorrect for methane. As detailed in the explanation for option B, the carbon atom achieves an outer shell of eight electrons, while each hydrogen atom achieves an outer shell of two electrons.

The subscripts for the atoms are 2 (for carbon), 4 (for hydrogen), and 1 (for oxygen). To determine if this is the simplest ratio, we look for the greatest common divisor of the subscripts.

Following the correct calculation of 1 kmol of FeS\u2082, assuming a 1:1 ratio would lead to 1 kmol of SO\u2082 being produced. The mass would then be calculated as 1 kmol \u00d7 64 kg/kmol = 64 kg. This is incorrect because the balanced equation clearly shows a 4:8 (or 1:2) mole ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 240 kg:** This answer results from a calculation error in the final step. After correctly determining that 2 kmol of SO\u2082 are produced, the molar mass of the reactant (FeS\u2082, Mr = 120) is mistakenly used instead of the molar mass of the product (SO\u2082, Mr = 64). The incorrect calculation would be: Mass = 2 kmol \u00d7 120 kg/kmol = 240 kg. To find the mass of a substance, its own molar mass must be used.\n\n*   **D) 512 kg:** This value is obtained if the mole ratio is incorrectly determined. After correctly calculating that there is 1 kmol of FeS\u2082, if one incorrectly assumes a 1:8 mole ratio (ignoring the '4' in front of FeS\u2082), it would lead to a calculation of 8 kmol of SO\u2082. The resulting mass would be 8 kmol \u00d7 64 kg/kmol = 512 kg.

It likely arises from an error in calculation, such as miscounting the number of bonds in one or more of the molecules involved in the reaction. A systematic application of the formula \u0394H = \u03a3(bonds broken) \u2013 \u03a3(bonds formed) requires accurately identifying and summing the energies for all bonds in both reactants and products, which yields \u20131313 kJ/mol.\n\n#### B: \u20131010 kJ/mol\nThis value is incorrect. Such an error could occur if the bond energies for different bonds were confused. For example, accidentally swapping the bond energy values for C\u2013H (413 kJ/mol) and O\u2013H (467 kJ/mol) during the calculation would lead to a significantly different result. It is crucial to correctly match each bond with its specific energy value from the table.\n\n#### D: \u20131369 kJ/mol\nThis result is incorrect and is close to the correct answer, suggesting a minor calculation error. This could be due to a simple arithmetic mistake or misreading a value from the table. The difference between this incorrect answer and the correct answer (\u20131313 kJ/mol) is 56 kJ. This difference is close to the difference between the O-H and C-H bond energies (467 - 413 = 54 kJ), indicating that a possible error was substituting one of these bonds for the other in the calculation.

This value is an intrinsic property of a specific chemical reaction and is determined by the nature of the chemical bonds being broken and formed. Changing the temperature does not alter the activation energy barrier itself. Therefore, the activation energy remains unchanged when the temperature is increased.\n2.  **Frequency of Collisions:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. When the temperature is increased, the particles absorb thermal energy, which is converted into kinetic energy. This causes the particles to move faster and more energetically. As a result of this increased speed, the particles will collide with each other more often in a given period. Thus, the frequency of particle collisions increases.\n\nIn summary, increasing the temperature does not change the activation energy but does increase the frequency of particle collisions. It is important to note that the primary reason for the significant increase in reaction rate with temperature is not just the increased collision frequency, but the much larger increase in the proportion of collisions that have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. However, based on the options provided, this row correctly identifies the effects on the two specified factors.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the activation energy increases. The activation energy is a fixed energy barrier for a given reaction and is not affected by changes in temperature. While it is correct that increasing the temperature increases the frequency of particle collisions, the error regarding activation energy makes this entire description incorrect.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option is incorrect on both points. Firstly, it incorrectly states that the activation energy increases. The activation energy is a constant for a specific reaction and is not changed by temperature. Secondly, it incorrectly states that the frequency of collisions shows no change. Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option correctly states that the activation energy experiences no change when the temperature is increased. However, it incorrectly states that the frequency of collisions also remains unchanged. When the temperature of a system is increased, particles gain kinetic energy, move more rapidly, and therefore collide more often.

Ethanoic acid is partially dissociated.**\n\nThe strength of an acid is determined by its degree of dissociation, or ionization, in an aqueous solution.\n\n*   **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)** is a **strong acid**. This means it completely dissociates in water. Every molecule of HCl separates into a hydrogen ion (H\u207a) and a chloride ion (Cl\u207b). Therefore, in a 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3 solution of HCl, the concentration of H\u207a ions is also 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3.\n    *   `HCl(aq) \u2192 H\u207a(aq) + Cl\u207b(aq)`\n\n*   **Ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH)** is a **weak acid**. This means it only partially dissociates in water. The process is a reversible reaction, and an equilibrium is established where most of the ethanoic acid remains as undissociated molecules. Only a small fraction of the molecules releases hydrogen ions.\n    *   `CH\u2083COOH(aq) \u21cc H\u207a(aq) + CH\u2083COO\u207b(aq)`\n\nBecause only a small proportion of ethanoic acid molecules ionize, a 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3 solution of ethanoic acid will have a hydrogen ion concentration that is significantly lower than 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3. This difference in the degree of dissociation is the fundamental reason why the concentration of hydrogen ions is higher in hydrochloric acid than in ethanoic acid of the same molarity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Ethanoic acid is an organic acid.**\n\nWhile this statement is true\u2014ethanoic acid is an organic compound containing a carboxyl functional group (-COOH)\u2014it does not explain why its hydrogen ion concentration is lower than that of hydrochloric acid. Acid strength is determined by the extent of dissociation in water, not by whether an acid is classified as organic or inorganic. There are both strong and weak organic acids, just as there are strong and weak inorganic acids.\n\n**B. Ethanoic acid has a lower pH than hydrochloric acid.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The pH scale is inversely related to the hydrogen ion concentration; a higher concentration of H\u207a ions corresponds to a lower pH. Since the question states that hydrochloric acid has a higher concentration of H\u207a ions, it must have a lower pH than ethanoic acid. Ethanoic acid, being a weaker acid with a lower H\u207a concentration, has a higher pH.\n\n**D. Ethanoic acid is a strong acid.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Ethanoic acid is a well-known example of a weak acid. If it were a strong acid, it would dissociate completely in water, just like hydrochloric acid. In that case, a 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3 solution of ethanoic acid would produce a hydrogen ion concentration of 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3, which would be equal to that of the hydrochloric acid solution.

It is an oxide of a reactive metal from Group 2 of the periodic table. Basic oxides react with acids to form a salt and water but do not react with bases. For example, calcium oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid (CaO + 2HCl \u2192 CaCl\u2082 + H\u2082O). Since it only exhibits basic properties and does not react with alkalis, it is not an amphoteric oxide.\n\n**C. copper(II) oxide**\nCopper(II) oxide (CuO) is a basic oxide. Although copper is a less reactive transition metal, its oxide still behaves as a base. It reacts with acids, such as sulfuric acid, to form copper(II) sulfate and water (CuO + H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 CuSO\u2084 + H\u2082O). However, it does not react with alkaline solutions.

This is because the reaction involves the loss of the two outermost (valence) electrons. As you go down the group, the number of electron shells increases. This results in a larger atomic radius and increased electron shielding, where the inner electron shells shield the valence electrons from the full attractive force of the positive nucleus. Consequently, the valence electrons are held less tightly and are more easily lost, leading to higher reactivity. The data provided supports this: the time taken to produce a fixed amount of hydrogen gas decreases from magnesium (>300s) to barium (10s), indicating a faster reaction rate and thus higher reactivity. Beryllium shows no reaction, confirming it is the least reactive.\n*   **Density:** The data for density shows the following values down the group: 1.85, 1.74, 1.54, 2.62, and 3.51 g/cm\u00b3. The density decreases from beryllium to calcium and then increases from calcium to barium. Because the trend is not consistently increasing or decreasing, it is described as having \"no clear trend\".\n*   **Melting Point:** The melting point depends on the strength of the metallic bonding. The data for melting points down the group is: 1280, 650, 850, 768, and 714 \u00b0C. The values do not follow a simple pattern; they decrease from beryllium to magnesium, increase for calcium, and then decrease again for strontium and barium. This fluctuation means there is \"no clear trend\" for the melting point down the group.\n\nTherefore, the reactivity increases, while both density and melting point show no clear trend.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly describes all three trends.\n\n*   **Reactivity:** The statement that reactivity decreases down the group is incorrect. Reactivity in Group II metals increases down the group. This is due to the increasing atomic radius and shielding effect, which makes it easier for atoms to lose their two valence electrons. The experimental data confirms this, as the time required for the reaction with water decreases significantly from magnesium to barium.\n*   **Density:** The statement that density increases down the group is an oversimplification and incorrect based on the data. While both atomic mass and atomic radius increase down the group, their ratio (which determines density) does not change uniformly. The density values decrease from beryllium (1.85 g/cm\u00b3) to calcium (1.54 g/cm\u00b3) before increasing.\n*   **Melting Point:** The statement that the melting point decreases down the group is also incorrect. Although there is a general downward trend, it is not consistent. The melting point of calcium (850 \u00b0C) is notably higher than that of magnesium (650 \u00b0C), which breaks any simple decreasing pattern.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the trends for reactivity and density.\n\n*   **Reactivity:** This option states that reactivity decreases down the group, which is incorrect. Reactivity of Group II elements increases down the group because the valence electrons are further from the nucleus and more shielded, making them easier to remove in a chemical reaction.\n*   **Density:** This option states that density decreases down the group, which is also incorrect. The provided data shows that density first decreases (from beryllium to calcium) and then increases (from calcium to barium). Therefore, there is no consistent decreasing trend.\n*   **Melting Point:** While this option correctly identifies that there is no clear trend for the melting point, the inaccuracies regarding reactivity and density make the entire option incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the trend for the melting point.\n\n*   **Reactivity:** This option correctly states that reactivity increases down the group.\n*   **Density:** This option correctly states that there is no clear trend for density.\n*   **Melting Point:** The statement that the melting point increases down the group is incorrect. The data shows a fluctuating pattern (1280 \u00b0C \u2192 650 \u00b0C \u2192 850 \u00b0C \u2192 768 \u00b0C \u2192 714 \u00b0C). There is no overall increasing trend; in fact, the general (but non-uniform) trend is a decrease. The assertion of an increasing trend is factually wrong.

The provided information about the bonding in the element oxfordium (Ox) is key to determining its number of valence electrons.\n\nThe element exists as a diatomic molecule, Ox\u2082, with a triple covalent bond between the two atoms (Ox\u2261Ox). A covalent bond is formed when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, typically a full outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule).\n\nA triple bond consists of three shared pairs of electrons, meaning each Ox atom contributes three electrons to the bond. To complete its octet, each atom requires a total of eight valence electrons. In the Ox\u2261Ox molecule, each atom has six electrons from the shared pairs. To reach eight, each atom must also have one lone pair of two electrons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valence electrons for each Ox atom is the sum of the electrons it contributes to the bond and its lone pair electrons: 3 (shared) + 2 (lone pair) = 5 valence electrons.\n\nElements with five valence electrons are placed in Group V of the Periodic Table. A well-known example from Group V is nitrogen, which also exists as a diatomic molecule with a triple bond (N\u2261N). The other properties listed\u2014insolubility in water and lack of electrical conductivity\u2014are characteristic of a simple molecular non-metal like nitrogen, further supporting this conclusion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Group III**\nElements in Group III have three valence electrons. To form a triple bond (Ox\u2261Ox), an atom would have to share all three of its valence electrons. This would leave it with only six electrons in its outer shell (the three shared pairs), failing to satisfy the stable octet rule. Therefore, an element from Group III would not typically form a stable diatomic molecule with a triple bond.\n\n**C) Group VII**\nElements in Group VII, the halogens, have seven valence electrons. They only need to gain one more electron to achieve a stable octet. They accomplish this by forming a single covalent bond with another atom, sharing one pair of electrons (e.g., F-F or Cl-Cl). It is not energetically favourable for them to form a triple bond, which would involve an unstable arrangement of their valence electrons.\n\n**D) Group VIII**\nElements in Group VIII, the noble gases, already possess a full and stable outer shell of eight valence electrons (except for helium, which has two). Because of this stability, they are generally unreactive and do not form covalent bonds with other atoms, including themselves. They exist as individual, unbonded atoms (monatomic), not as diatomic molecules."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_21.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "21 which row describes a similarity and a difference between chlorine and bromine?\n[sia atrence\n\na both are gases at room chlorine and bromine\n\ntemperature and pressure have different colours\nb both exist as chlorine is more\n\ndiatomic molecules dense than bromine\n\ncc both have atoms with only bromine will react with\n\nseven outer-shell electrons aqueous sodium chloride\nd both react with aqueous chlorine is more reactive\n\npotassium iodide than bromine", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies both a similarity and a difference between chlorine and bromine based on their chemical properties as halogens.\n\n*   **Similarity:** Both chlorine and bromine are more reactive than iodine.

Chlorine is in Period 3, while bromine is in Period 4. Therefore, chlorine is more reactive than bromine. This is because a chlorine atom has fewer electron shells than a bromine atom, resulting in less shielding. This allows the chlorine nucleus to exert a stronger electrostatic force of attraction on an incoming electron to complete its outer shell.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A:**\n*   **Similarity:** The statement that both are gases at room temperature and pressure (RTP) is incorrect. While chlorine is a pale green gas at RTP, bromine is a volatile, reddish-brown liquid. The boiling point increases down the group due to stronger intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces) between larger molecules.\n*   **Difference:** The statement that they have different colours is correct (chlorine is pale green, bromine is reddish-brown).

Chlorine and bromine are both in Group 17 of the periodic table, and the group number indicates the number of valence electrons.\n*   **Difference:** The statement that only bromine will react with aqueous sodium chloride is incorrect. Reactivity decreases down the group, meaning chlorine is more reactive than bromine. A more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halide from its salt solution.

They have high densities and high melting points.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes two key physical properties of transition elements.\n\n*   **High Melting Points:** Transition elements have strong metallic bonding. This is because electrons from both the outermost s-subshell and the inner d-subshell are delocalised, forming a \"sea\" of electrons. The strong electrostatic attraction between the resulting positive metal ions and the delocalised electrons requires a large amount of thermal energy to overcome, leading to high melting and boiling points. For instance, iron melts at 1538 \u00b0C and tungsten melts at 3422 \u00b0C.\n\n*   **High Densities:** Density is the mass per unit volume. Transition elements have relatively high atomic masses and their atoms are packed closely and efficiently in a metallic lattice structure. This combination of high mass in a compact volume results in high densities. This is in contrast to Group 1 metals like sodium, which are less dense than water.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. They have high densities and low melting points.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while transition elements do have high densities, they generally have high, not low, melting points. The strong metallic bonding present in transition metals requires a significant amount of energy to break the lattice structure during melting. The only notable exception is mercury, which is a liquid at room temperature, but this is not representative of the group as a whole.\n\n**C. They have low densities and high melting points.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while transition elements do have high melting points, they do not have low densities. Their high atomic masses and tight atomic packing in the metallic lattice result in high densities. Elements with low densities are typically found in Group 1 (alkali metals) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals).\n\n**D. They have low densities and low melting points.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect as it describes the properties of Group 1 alkali metals, not transition elements. Alkali metals have weaker metallic bonding (only one valence electron per atom) and larger atomic radii, which leads to both low melting points and low densities.

The chlorine atoms from the hydrochloric acid (HCl) remain in the solution as chloride ions (Cl\u207b), which combine with the newly formed zinc ions (Zn\u00b2\u207a) to create the salt, zinc chloride (ZnCl\u2082). The reaction involves the displacement of hydrogen ions by zinc metal, not the oxidation of chloride ions to form elemental chlorine gas.\n\n**D) oxygen**\nOxygen gas (O\u2082) is not a product of the reaction between a metal and an acid.

The carbon atoms prevent layers of iron atoms from sliding over each other.**\n\nIn its pure form, iron, like other metals, has a regular, crystalline lattice structure. The iron atoms are all the same size and are arranged in orderly layers. When a force is applied to pure iron, these layers of atoms can slide over one another relatively easily, which makes pure iron quite malleable and less strong.\n\nSteel is an alloy, which means it is a mixture of a metal with at least one other element. In steel, a small amount of carbon is added to the iron. The carbon atoms are much smaller than the iron atoms and they fit into the spaces between them, disrupting the regular, layered arrangement of the iron lattice. This disruption makes it significantly more difficult for the layers of iron atoms to slide past each other. Consequently, a greater force is required to deform the metal, making steel much harder and stronger than pure iron.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Steel contains carbon which is a very hard substance.**\n\nWhile some forms of carbon, such as diamond, are extremely hard, this statement does not correctly explain the strengthening mechanism in steel. The strength of an alloy is determined by its atomic structure, not simply by the intrinsic properties of its constituent elements. The small percentage of carbon atoms strengthens the entire metallic structure by interacting with the iron lattice, rather than just adding \"hard\" particles to the mix.\n\n**B. The carbon atoms in steel bond together very strongly.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. In the structure of steel, the carbon atoms are dispersed throughout the iron lattice, occupying interstitial positions (the gaps between the larger iron atoms). They primarily form bonds with the surrounding iron atoms, not with each other to form a separate, strongly bonded carbon network within the steel. The strengthening effect is not due to carbon-carbon bonding.\n\n**C. The carbon atoms in steel make the iron atoms bond together very strongly.**\n\nThis is a misconception. The presence of carbon atoms does not significantly increase the strength of the individual metallic bonds between the iron atoms. The metallic bonding in iron is already strong. The increase in the overall strength of steel is a mechanical effect at the atomic scale, arising from the disruption of the lattice structure which impedes the movement of atomic layers, rather than a chemical change that enhances the bonding energy between iron atoms."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_26.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "26 three students, x, y and z, are told that solid p reacts with dilute acids and also conducts\nelectricity.\nthe table shows the students\u2019 suggestions about the identity of p.\nwhich students are correct?\na x,yandz b xonly c yonly d zonly", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (C)\n\nThe problem states that solid P reacts with dilute acids and conducts electricity.

Metals have a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These free-moving electrons allow metals to conduct electricity.

However, upon exposure to air, a thin, transparent, and very tough layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) forms almost instantaneously on its surface. This process is called passivation. This oxide layer is non-porous and adheres strongly to the metal, acting as a protective barrier. It prevents the reactive aluminium metal underneath from coming into contact with other substances like air, water, or dilute acids, thus preventing further chemical reactions. This is why aluminium appears to be unreactive in everyday situations.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: It has a low density.**\nDensity is a physical property, defined as mass per unit volume. While aluminium's low density is a key property that makes it useful in applications like aircraft and overhead power lines, it has no bearing on its chemical reactivity. Chemical reactivity is determined by an element's electron configuration and its tendency to participate in chemical reactions, not by its density.\n\n**C: It is low in the reactivity series.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in order of decreasing chemical reactivity. Aluminium is located high in the series, above zinc, iron, and lead. Its position indicates that it is an inherently reactive metal, more reactive than many common metals. Its apparent lack of reactivity is due to the protective oxide layer, not its position in the series.\n\n**D: It is solid at room temperature.**\nThe physical state of a substance at a given temperature is not an indicator of its chemical reactivity. Many metals are solid at room temperature, and they span the entire spectrum of reactivity. For example, sodium and potassium are highly reactive solids, while gold and platinum are very unreactive solids.

The anode is the positive electrode, and it is made of carbon (graphite).\n\n1.  **Reaction at the Anode:** Negatively charged oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) are attracted to the positive anode.

This is a combustion reaction.\n    *   Chemical equation: C(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g)\n\n3.  **Mass Change:** As the solid carbon from the anode reacts to form gaseous carbon dioxide, the anode is consumed or \"eaten away\". This leads to a continuous decrease in the mass of the anode. Consequently, the carbon anodes must be replaced periodically.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the anode decreases because the carbon of the anode reacts with the oxygen produced during electrolysis to form carbon dioxide.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **B: decreases, carbon dissolves in molten cryolite**\n    The mass of the anode does decrease, but the reason provided is incorrect. The primary reason for the mass loss is the chemical reaction between the carbon anode and the oxygen gas produced at the anode. While minimal dissolution might occur, the significant and continuous consumption of the anode is due to its conversion into carbon dioxide gas, not a physical process of dissolving in the cryolite solvent.\n\n*   **C: increases, electrodes become coated with cryolite**\n    This statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the mass of the carbon anode decreases, it does not increase. Secondly, cryolite (Na\u2083AlF\u2086) acts as a solvent to lower the melting point of aluminium oxide. The ions from cryolite (Na\u207a and F\u207b) are not discharged in preference to Al\u00b3\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b, so cryolite itself does not deposit on the electrodes.\n\n*   **D: increases, electrodes become coated with aluminium**\n    This statement is incorrect. The mass of the anode decreases, not increases. Furthermore, aluminium is formed at the cathode (the negative electrode), not the anode (the positive electrode). Positive aluminium ions (Al\u00b3\u207a) are attracted to the negatively charged cathode, where they gain electrons (are reduced) to form molten aluminium metal (Al\u00b3\u207a + 3e\u207b \u2192 Al(l))."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_29.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "29 several processes are used to treat domestic water.\nwhich row identifies a reason for the given process?\nee\na chlorination removes impurities\nb filtration removes insoluble solids\ncc sedimentation removes soluble solids\nd use of carbon kills bacteria", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nFiltration is a key physical process in water treatment. It involves passing water through layers of filter media, such as sand, gravel, and charcoal. These layers act as a physical barrier, trapping and removing suspended particles that have not settled out during sedimentation. These suspended particles are solids that do not dissolve in water and are therefore referred to as insoluble solids. Thus, the primary reason for filtration is to remove insoluble solids, improving the clarity of the water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: chlorination - removes impurities**\nThis statement is inaccurate. Chlorination is a chemical disinfection process where chlorine is added to water. Its specific purpose is to kill or inactivate pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, making the water safe to drink. While microorganisms can be considered impurities, the term \"removes impurities\" is too general. Chlorination does not remove other types of impurities like suspended solids or dissolved salts. Its primary function is disinfection, not the physical removal of a broad range of substances.\n\n**C: sedimentation - removes soluble solids**\nThis statement is incorrect. Sedimentation is a process where water is left to stand in a large tank, allowing heavier, suspended solids to settle to the bottom due to gravity. This process removes *insoluble* solids (like silt and clay), not soluble solids. Soluble solids are substances that are dissolved in the water (e.g., salts) and will not settle out on their own. Therefore, sedimentation cannot remove soluble solids.\n\n**D: use of carbon - kills bacteria**\nThis statement is incorrect. Activated carbon (or charcoal) is used in water treatment for its adsorptive properties.

During this process, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil are used as raw materials. In the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll (the green pigment in plants), these reactants are converted into glucose (a type of sugar, which serves as food for the plant) and oxygen (which is released into the atmosphere).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this process is:\n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n\nThis equation shows that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) react with six molecules of water (H\u2082O) to produce one molecule of glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) and six molecules of oxygen (O\u2082).

CO\u2082 + 3H\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2083OH + H\u2082O**\nThis equation is incorrect because it does not represent photosynthesis. The reactants for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water (H\u2082O), not hydrogen gas (H\u2082). Furthermore, the primary organic product of photosynthesis is glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), not methanol (CH\u2083OH).

In this process, glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) is broken down in the absence of oxygen to produce ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).

They absorb thermal energy from the Earth and emit some of this energy towards the Earth.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the mechanism of the greenhouse effect, to which methane contributes. The process occurs in two main steps:\n\n1.  **Absorption:** The Earth's surface is warmed by short-wavelength radiation from the Sun. The warm Earth then radiates this energy back towards space as long-wavelength infrared (IR) radiation, which is a form of thermal energy. The covalent bonds within greenhouse gas molecules, such as the C-H bonds in methane (CH\u2084), are very effective at absorbing energy at these specific infrared wavelengths. This absorption causes the bonds to vibrate more energetically.\n\n2.  **Re-emission:** After absorbing this energy, the excited methane molecule is unstable and quickly re-emits the energy, also as infrared radiation. This re-emission occurs in all directions randomly. A significant portion of this re-emitted radiation is directed back down towards the Earth's surface and the lower atmosphere. This process traps thermal energy that would otherwise escape into space, leading to an increase in the Earth's average temperature, known as global warming.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. They absorb thermal energy from the Sun and emit some of this energy into space.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because greenhouse gases like methane are largely transparent to the high-energy, short-wavelength radiation that comes directly from the Sun. They primarily absorb the lower-energy, long-wavelength infrared radiation that is emitted by the Earth. Furthermore, while some re-emitted energy does go into space, the warming effect is caused by the portion that is radiated back to Earth, not the portion that escapes.\n\n**B. They absorb thermal energy from the Sun and emit all of this energy towards the Earth.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, the primary source of absorbed energy is the Earth, not the Sun. Secondly, the re-emission of energy is isotropic (in all directions), not directed exclusively towards the Earth. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that *all* of the absorbed energy is emitted towards the Earth.\n\n**C. They absorb thermal energy from the Earth and emit all of this energy towards the Earth.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the source of the absorbed energy as the Earth. However, it is incorrect in stating that *all* of this energy is emitted back towards the Earth. The energy is re-emitted randomly in all directions. Some travels back to Earth, some is absorbed by other atmospheric molecules, and some escapes into space. The claim that \"all\" the energy is returned to Earth is an overstatement and is physically inaccurate."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_32.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "32. the structural formulae of two hydrocarbons are shown.\nch3ch2ch2ch3 ch3ch(chs3)ch3\nwhich statement about the hydrocarbons is correct?\na they are both alkenes.\nb_ they decolourise aqueous bromine.\nc_ they are structural isomers.\nd_ they undergo addition reactions.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C. They are structural isomers.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Structural isomers are compounds that share the same molecular formula but have different arrangements of atoms in space (different structural formulae).\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of the first hydrocarbon:** CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2083 (butane).\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 4\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10\n    *   Molecular Formula: C\u2084H\u2081\u2080\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular formula of the second hydrocarbon:** CH\u2083CH(CH\u2083)CH\u2083 (2-methylpropane).\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 10\n    *   Molecular Formula: C\u2084H\u2081\u2080\n\nBoth hydrocarbons have the same molecular formula, C\u2084H\u2081\u2080. However, their structures are different. The first is a straight-chain molecule (butane), while the second is a branched-chain molecule (2-methylpropane). Therefore, they are structural isomers.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. They are both alkenes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Their general formula is C\u2099H\u2082\u2099. Both hydrocarbons shown have the molecular formula C\u2084H\u2081\u2080, which fits the general formula for alkanes (C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082). Furthermore, their structural formulae show only single bonds between carbon atoms. Therefore, they are alkanes, not alkenes.\n\n**B. They decolourise aqueous bromine.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The decolourisation of aqueous bromine (from brown/orange to colourless) is a chemical test used to identify the presence of unsaturated compounds, specifically those with carbon-carbon double (C=C) or triple (C\u2261C) bonds. This occurs via an addition reaction. The two hydrocarbons shown are alkanes, which are saturated compounds (they only have single C-C bonds). Alkanes do not react with aqueous bromine under normal laboratory conditions and therefore do not decolourise it.\n\n**D. They undergo addition reactions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Addition reactions are characteristic of unsaturated compounds like alkenes and alkynes. In an addition reaction, atoms are added across a double or triple bond, breaking the \u03c0-bond(s). The hydrocarbons shown are alkanes, which are saturated. Saturated compounds cannot undergo addition reactions because they lack double or triple bonds.

The boiling point of a hydrocarbon is directly related to its chain length: longer hydrocarbon chains have stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) between molecules. These stronger forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in higher boiling points.\n\nIn a fractionating column, there is a temperature gradient; it is hottest at the bottom and becomes progressively cooler towards the top. When heated crude oil enters the column, it vaporizes. As the hot vapours rise, they cool and condense at different levels (trays) according to their boiling points.\n\nFraction D is collected at a low level in the column where the temperature is high. This means the hydrocarbons in this fraction have high boiling points. High boiling points correspond to long hydrocarbon chains. Therefore, among the fractions A, B, C, and D, fraction D contains the hydrocarbons with the longest chain length.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A)** Fraction A is collected near the top of the fractionating column, which is the coolest region. Only hydrocarbons with very low boiling points will rise this high before condensing. Low boiling points are characteristic of hydrocarbons with short carbon chains and weak intermolecular forces. Therefore, fraction A contains hydrocarbons with some of the shortest chain lengths.\n\n**B)** Fraction B is collected at a level below A but above C and D. This position indicates that the hydrocarbons in this fraction have boiling points that are higher than those in fraction A but lower than those in fractions C and D.

Polymers with amide linkages are called polyamides. Nylon is a specific example of a synthetic polyamide. However, proteins are natural polyamides.

This occurs when a substance absorbs energy, causing its particles to gain kinetic energy and overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction that hold them together.\n\n*   **Evaporation (2):** This is the process where a liquid changes into a gas at its surface. During evaporation, particles with sufficient kinetic energy escape from the liquid phase, where they are closely packed, and enter the gaseous phase, where they are far apart and move randomly.\n*   **Boiling (4):** This is the process where a liquid changes into a gas throughout its entire volume when it reaches a specific temperature (the boiling point). Similar to evaporation, this transition from liquid to gas involves a significant increase in the distance between particles.\n\nTherefore, both evaporation and boiling are processes in which the particles of ethanol move further apart.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**Option A is incorrect.** While evaporation (2) is a process where particles move further apart, condensation (1) is the opposite. Condensation is the change of state from a gas to a liquid. During condensation, gas particles, which are widely separated, lose energy and come closer together to form a liquid.\n\n**Option B is incorrect.** Both processes listed involve particles moving closer together, not further apart.\n*   **Condensation (1):** This is the change from gas to liquid, where particles move significantly closer.\n*   **Freezing (3):** This is the change from liquid to solid. In this process, particles lose kinetic energy and settle into a more ordered, tightly packed structure, thus moving closer together.\n\n**Option D is incorrect.** While boiling (4) is a process where particles move further apart, freezing (3) is a process where particles move closer together.

A nitrogen atom (N) is in Group 15 of the periodic table and has five outer-shell electrons. A hydrogen atom (H) is in Group 1 and has one outer-shell electron. To achieve a stable electron configuration, the nitrogen atom forms three single covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms. In each bond, the nitrogen atom shares one of its five valence electrons, and a hydrogen atom shares its single valence electron. This allows each hydrogen atom to achieve a stable duplet (two electrons), and the nitrogen atom to achieve a stable octet (eight electrons). The diagram correctly shows the nitrogen atom (electrons as 'x') sharing one electron with each of the three hydrogen atoms (electrons as '\u2022'). The remaining two electrons of the nitrogen atom are not involved in bonding and exist as a lone pair, which is also correctly shown.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it inaccurately represents the origin of the electrons. While the nitrogen atom has the correct total of five outer-shell electrons and each hydrogen has one, the symbols used are inconsistent. More importantly, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is shown as being composed of one electron from nitrogen ('x') and one from another source ('\u2022'). A lone pair consists of electrons that belong only to that specific atom and are not involved in bonding. Therefore, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom should be composed of two electrons from nitrogen ('xx').\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, each hydrogen atom is shown with two of its own electrons (represented by '\u2022'). A neutral hydrogen atom only has one outer-shell electron to contribute to bonding. Secondly, as with option A, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is incorrectly shown as a mix of electrons from different atoms ('x\u2022'), whereas it should consist solely of nitrogen's own non-bonding electrons.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows each hydrogen atom possessing two of its own outer-shell electrons (represented by '\u2022'). A hydrogen atom has only one electron in its outer shell. By depicting two electrons for each hydrogen atom before bonding, the diagram misrepresents the fundamental structure of the atoms involved.

It consists of individual, discrete CO\u2082 molecules with strong covalent double bonds within the molecules (O=C=O) but only weak intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules.

In a metallic structure, for example, the atoms release their valence electrons, which are then free to move throughout the entire solid lattice of positive metal ions.

They can only conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water, as this frees the ions to move and carry a charge.

This leaves the unreacted sodium ions (Na\u207a) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) in the solution. These ions combine to form aqueous **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**, making the remaining solution alkaline. Therefore, sodium hydroxide is a key product of the overall process.

It achieves this by providing an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy (E\u2090). Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for reactant particles to have upon collision for a reaction to occur. By lowering this energy barrier, a greater proportion of reactant particles possess the necessary energy for a collision to be effective, thus increasing the frequency of successful collisions and accelerating the reaction rate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. decrease in size of solid reactants:**\nDecreasing the particle size of a solid reactant (e.g., by grinding a lump into a powder) does increase the rate of reaction. However, it does so by increasing the total surface area of the reactant. A larger surface area exposes more reactant particles, leading to a higher frequency of collisions between the reactants. This change does not alter the activation energy (E\u2090) of the reaction; the energy required for any single collision to be successful remains the same.\n\n**C. increase in concentration of solutions:**\nIncreasing the concentration of reactants in a solution increases the number of reactant particles per unit volume. This proximity leads to more frequent collisions between the particles, which in turn increases the rate of reaction. This method increases the rate by increasing the collision frequency, not by lowering the activation energy (E\u2090). The energy threshold for a successful reaction is unaffected.\n\n**D. increase in temperature:**\nIncreasing the temperature increases the rate of reaction for two main reasons. Firstly, it increases the average kinetic energy of the reactant particles, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently. Secondly, and more significantly, it results in a greater proportion of particles having kinetic energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (E\u2090). While this increases the frequency of *effective* collisions, it does not lower the activation energy itself.

The conditions used are a compromise to achieve a high yield at an economically viable rate.\n\n*   **Temperature:** The forward reaction is exothermic, so according to Le Chatelier's principle, a low temperature would favour the formation of sulfur trioxide and result in a higher yield. However, a low temperature also results in a very slow rate of reaction. A compromise temperature of 450 \u00b0C is used to achieve a reasonably fast reaction rate while still maintaining a high equilibrium yield (around 99.5%).\n*   **Pressure:** The forward reaction involves a reduction in the number of moles of gas (from 3 moles of reactants to 2 moles of product). Le Chatelier's principle indicates that a high pressure would shift the equilibrium to the right, favouring the product. However, the yield is already very high at relatively low pressures, and using very high pressures requires expensive equipment and high energy costs. Therefore, a moderate pressure of around 1-2 atmospheres (approximately 100-200 kPa) is sufficient and economically practical.\n*   **Catalyst:** To increase the rate of this reaction, a catalyst is essential. The specific catalyst used in the Contact process is Vanadium(V) oxide (V\u2082O\u2085).\n\nTherefore, the conditions of 450 \u00b0C, 200 kPa, and a Vanadium(V) oxide catalyst are the correct industrial conditions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option is incorrect because it lists a temperature of 300 \u00b0C and an iron catalyst. While a lower temperature of 300 \u00b0C would theoretically give a higher yield because the reaction is exothermic, the rate of reaction would be far too slow to be commercially viable. Furthermore, iron is the catalyst used in the Haber process for producing ammonia, not in the Contact process for sulfuric acid.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect due to the specified temperature and pressure. A temperature of 300 \u00b0C would lead to an impractically slow reaction rate. A pressure of 20 000 kPa (approximately 200 atm) is unnecessarily high. While high pressure would favour the product, the reaction provides a very high yield at much lower, more economical pressures. The high cost of building and maintaining a plant to withstand such high pressures is not justified.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it lists an excessively high pressure and the wrong catalyst. A pressure of 20 000 kPa is not economically viable for this process. The catalyst used in the Contact process is Vanadium(V) oxide, not iron. Iron is the catalyst for the Haber process.

This is a slow but spontaneous chemical change. The process is not considered reversible in a simple manner; you cannot turn rust back into pure iron by simply removing the moist air. Reversing this process requires complex and energy-intensive methods, such as those used in a blast furnace. Therefore, rusting is classified as an irreversible reaction.\n\n**B. limestone reacting with an acid to form carbon dioxide gas**\nThe reaction between limestone (calcium carbonate) and an acid is a neutralisation reaction that produces a salt, water, and carbon dioxide gas.

The loss of a product from the reaction system prevents the reverse reaction from occurring, driving the forward reaction to completion. Thus, this reaction is considered irreversible.\n\n**C. magnesium burning in air to produce a white ash**\nThe burning of magnesium in air is a combustion reaction, where magnesium reacts vigorously with oxygen to form magnesium oxide, a stable white solid. This reaction is highly exothermic, releasing a large amount of energy as heat and light. Such combustion reactions are generally irreversible.

A reducing agent is the substance that is oxidised. An oxidising agent is a substance that causes oxidation by accepting electrons, and in the process, it is itself reduced. Reduction is the gain of electrons, which corresponds to a decrease in the oxidation state.\n\nTo identify what is oxidised and what is the oxidising agent, we must determine the change in oxidation states for the elements in the reaction:\n**3SO\u2082 + Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b + 2H\u207a \u2192 3SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b + 2Cr\u00b3\u207a + H\u2082O**\n\n1.  **Analyse Sulfur (S):**\n    *   In the reactant sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Since the molecule is neutral, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) is +4. [S + 2(-2) = 0, so S = +4].\n    *   In the product sulfate ion (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b), oxygen is -2. The overall charge is -2. The oxidation state of sulfur (S) is +6. [S + 4(-2) = -2, so S = +6].\n    *   The oxidation state of sulfur increases from +4 to +6. An increase in oxidation state is oxidation. Therefore, **SO\u2082 is oxidised**.\n\n2.  **Analyse Chromium (Cr):**\n    *   In the reactant dichromate(VI) ion (Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b), oxygen is -2. The overall charge is -2. The oxidation state of each chromium (Cr) atom is +6. [2(Cr) + 7(-2) = -2, so 2(Cr) = +12, and Cr = +6].\n    *   In the product chromium(III) ion (Cr\u00b3\u207a), the oxidation state of chromium is simply its charge, which is +3.\n    *   The oxidation state of chromium decreases from +6 to +3. A decrease in oxidation state is reduction.\n    *   The substance that is reduced is the oxidising agent. Therefore, **Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b is the oxidising agent**.\n\nCombining these findings, SO\u2082 is the substance oxidised, and Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b is the oxidising agent.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: oxidised = SO\u2082, oxidising agent = H\u207a**\nThis option correctly identifies that sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is oxidised. However, it incorrectly identifies the hydrogen ion (H\u207a) as the oxidising agent. The oxidation state of hydrogen in the reactant H\u207a is +1. In the product water (H\u2082O), its oxidation state is also +1. Since the oxidation state of hydrogen does not change, it is neither oxidised nor reduced, and therefore cannot be the oxidising agent. The H\u207a ions provide the acidic conditions necessary for the reaction to occur.\n\n**C: oxidised = Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b, oxidising agent = H\u207a**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. The dichromate(VI) ion (Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b) is not oxidised; it is reduced, as the oxidation state of chromium decreases from +6 to +3. The substance that is reduced acts as the oxidising agent, it is not the substance being oxidised. As explained for option B, the hydrogen ion (H\u207a) is not the oxidising agent because its oxidation state does not change.\n\n**D: oxidised = Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b, oxidising agent = Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b**\nThis option incorrectly identifies Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b as the substance being oxidised. In the reaction, Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b is reduced. While it correctly identifies Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b as the oxidising agent (because it is reduced), a substance cannot be both oxidised and the oxidising agent in the same reaction.

Its defining characteristic is its ability to react with both acids and bases to form a salt and water. When it reacts with an acid, it behaves as a base. Conversely, when it reacts with a base, it behaves as an acid.

They are made by combining an acidic oxide with a basic oxide.**\nThis statement describes a neutralization reaction between two types of oxides, which results in the formation of a salt. For example, the reaction between a basic oxide like calcium oxide (CaO) and an acidic oxide like carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) produces the salt calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083). Amphoteric oxides are single compounds, typically formed from the reaction of a specific metal (such as zinc, aluminum, or lead) with oxygen. They are not synthesized by combining other oxides.\n\n**B. They react with water to give a solution of pH 7.**\nMost amphoteric oxides, including common examples like zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083), are insoluble in water. Because they do not dissolve or react, they do not form a solution and therefore do not affect the pH of the water. In general, oxides that react with water are either acidic (forming a solution with pH < 7) or basic (forming a solution with pH > 7).

The goal is to isolate this solid product in a pure, dry state from the final reaction mixture. The mixture contains the solid precipitate (`CuCO3`) and a solution of the soluble byproduct, sodium nitrate (`NaNO3`), dissolved in water.\n\n1.  **Filtration:** The first step is to separate the solid copper(II) carbonate from the liquid solution. Filtration is the correct technique for separating an insoluble solid from a liquid. The solid precipitate is collected on the filter paper as the residue, while the aqueous solution (filtrate) passes through.\n\n2.  **Washing:** The solid residue on the filter paper will be contaminated with the soluble sodium nitrate from the filtrate. To obtain pure copper(II) carbonate, these soluble impurities must be removed. This is achieved by washing the residue with a small amount of distilled water. The distilled water will dissolve the impurities and wash them away, leaving the pure, insoluble copper(II) carbonate on the filter paper.\n\n3.  **Drying:** After washing, the pure copper(II) carbonate is still wet. The final step is to dry the solid, typically by leaving it in a warm oven or a desiccator.

Within a single period, the proton number increases from left to right. The number of outer shell (valence) electrons also generally increases across a period. Element R has 2 outer shell electrons, placing it in Group 2. Element Q has 7 outer shell electrons, placing it in Group 17. Since Group 2 is to the left of Group 17 in the same period, element R has a lower position and therefore a lower proton number than element Q.\n\n***\n### Explanation for Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Q is a metal and R is a non-metal.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An element's metallic character is determined by its tendency to lose or gain electrons. Element R has 2 electrons in its outer shell, which it will readily lose to form a stable positive ion. This behaviour is characteristic of a metal. Element Q has 7 electrons in its outer shell and will tend to gain one electron to achieve a stable octet, forming a negative ion. This is characteristic of a non-metal. Therefore, R is a metal and Q is a non-metal.\n\n**B. Q and R have different numbers of electron shells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The period number in the Periodic Table corresponds to the number of occupied electron shells an element possesses. As the question states that elements Q and R are in the same period, they must have the same number of electron shells.\n\n**C. R is found to the right of Q in the Periodic Table.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Elements are arranged in a period in order of increasing proton number, which corresponds to an increase in the number of valence electrons from left to right. Element R has 2 valence electrons (Group 2), while element Q has 7 valence electrons (Group 17). Since 2 is less than 7, element R is located in an earlier group and is therefore found to the left of element Q in the same period."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_60.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "20 lead(ii) sulfate is an insoluble salt.\nwhich reaction produces a mixture from which lead(ii) sulfate is obtained by filtration?\na adding solid lead(ii) carbonate to dilute sulfuric acid\nb adding solid lead(ii) hydroxide to dilute sulfuric acid\nc_ adding metallic lead to dilute sulfuric acid\nd adding aqueous lead(ii) nitrate to dilute sulfuric acid", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**D. adding aqueous lead(II) nitrate to dilute sulfuric acid**\n\nThis is the correct method for preparing lead(II) sulfate. The process involves a **precipitation reaction**.\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Both lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082) and sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) are soluble in water, forming aqueous solutions. In solution, they exist as dissociated ions: Pb\u00b2\u207a(aq), NO\u2083\u207b(aq), H\u207a(aq), and SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b(aq).\n2.  **Reaction:** When the two solutions are mixed, the lead(II) ions (Pb\u00b2\u207a) from the lead(II) nitrate solution combine with the sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) from the sulfuric acid. This forms lead(II) sulfate (PbSO\u2084), which is an insoluble solid precipitate. The other ions, H\u207a and NO\u2083\u207b, remain in solution as aqueous nitric acid (HNO\u2083).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is:  \n        Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq) + H\u2082SO\u2084(aq) \u2192 PbSO\u2084(s) + 2HNO\u2083(aq)\n3.  **Separation:** The resulting mixture contains solid lead(II) sulfate suspended in an aqueous solution of nitric acid. Filtration can be used to easily separate the solid precipitate (the residue) from the liquid solution (the filtrate). This is the standard laboratory method for preparing an insoluble salt from two soluble reactants.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. adding solid lead(II) carbonate to dilute sulfuric acid**\n\nThis reaction is not suitable for preparing lead(II) sulfate. Although lead(II) carbonate reacts with sulfuric acid, the reaction is self-limiting.\n\n*   **The Problem:** The reactant, lead(II) carbonate (PbCO\u2083), is an insoluble solid. The product, lead(II) sulfate (PbSO\u2084), is also an insoluble solid.\n*   **The Consequence:** When sulfuric acid is added to solid lead(II) carbonate, a thin, impervious layer of lead(II) sulfate immediately forms on the surface of the carbonate particles. This layer acts as a barrier, preventing the acid from reaching the unreacted lead(II) carbonate underneath. This process is called **passivation**. The reaction quickly stops, leaving an impure mixture of unreacted lead(II) carbonate coated with a small amount of lead(II) sulfate.\n\n**B. adding solid lead(II) hydroxide to dilute sulfuric acid**\n\nThis method is incorrect for the same reason as option A.\n\n*   **The Problem:** The reactant, lead(II) hydroxide (Pb(OH)\u2082), is an insoluble solid, and the product, lead(II) sulfate (PbSO\u2084), is also an insoluble solid.\n*   **The Consequence:** The reaction produces a layer of insoluble lead(II) sulfate on the surface of the solid lead(II) hydroxide. This coating prevents further reaction between the acid and the hydroxide, resulting in an incomplete reaction and an impure solid product.\n\n**C. adding metallic lead to dilute sulfuric acid**\n\nThis reaction is also ineffective due to passivation.\n\n*   **The Problem:** While lead is above hydrogen in the reactivity series and should react with acid, the product of the reaction, lead(II) sulfate (PbSO\u2084), is insoluble.\n*   **The Consequence:** As the reaction begins, a layer of insoluble lead(II) sulfate forms on the surface of the lead metal. This layer protects the metal from further attack by the sulfuric acid, effectively stopping the reaction. Therefore, only a negligible amount of lead(II) sulfate is produced."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_61.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "21. which statement about alkali metals is correct?\na lithium is more dense than sodium.\nb_ sodium is more reactive than potassium.\nc_ sodium has a higher melting point than potassium.\nd_ they are in group ii of the periodic table.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C. Sodium has a higher melting point than potassium.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The alkali metals (Group I) exhibit clear trends in their physical properties. As you descend the group from lithium to francium, the melting points decrease. This is due to the nature of metallic bonding. In a metal, positive ions are held together in a lattice by a \"sea\" of delocalised electrons. As you go down Group I, the atoms become larger, meaning the distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised valence electron increases. This larger atomic radius weakens the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nuclei and the delocalised electrons. Consequently, less energy is required to overcome these forces and break the metallic bonds, resulting in a lower melting point. Since sodium is above potassium in Group I, it has a smaller atomic radius, stronger metallic bonds, and therefore a higher melting point (97.8 \u00b0C for Na vs. 63.5 \u00b0C for K).\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Lithium is more dense than sodium.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The general trend for density in Group I is that it increases down the group. This is because although the atomic radius increases, the atomic mass increases more significantly, leading to a greater mass packed into a given volume. Lithium is the first element in the group, and sodium is the second. Therefore, lithium is less dense than sodium. The density of lithium is 0.534 g/cm\u00b3, while the density of sodium is 0.968 g/cm\u00b3. (Note: there is an anomaly in this trend, as potassium is slightly less dense than sodium, but the statement comparing lithium and sodium is false).\n\n**B. Sodium is more reactive than potassium.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The chemical reactivity of alkali metals increases as you descend Group I. Reactivity is determined by how easily an atom can lose its single outer shell electron to form a positive ion (i.e., its first ionisation energy). As you move down the group, the atomic radius increases, and the number of inner electron shells also increases. This leads to increased electron shielding, where the inner electrons repel the outer electron. Both factors weaken the attraction between the positive nucleus and the single valence electron, making it easier to remove. Since potassium is below sodium in the group, its outer electron is lost more readily, making potassium more reactive than sodium.\n\n**D. They are in Group II of the Periodic Table.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The alkali metals are the elements that constitute Group I of the Periodic Table. These elements (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium) are characterised by having a single electron in their outermost shell. The elements in Group II of the Periodic Table are known as the alkaline earth metals (e.g., beryllium, magnesium, calcium) and they have two electrons in their outermost shell."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_62.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "22 which row describes the properties of a transition element?\nmelting \u2018 forms coloured\n; density\npoint compounds\na high low no\nb high high yes\ncc low low no\nd low low yes", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nTransition elements possess a distinct set of physical and chemical properties.

This is due to strong metallic bonding, arising from the delocalisation of electrons from both the outer s-orbital and the inner d-orbitals, which pulls the atoms closely and strongly together. Furthermore, a hallmark chemical property of transition elements is their ability to **form coloured compounds**. This occurs because their ions have partially filled d-orbitals. Electrons can move between these d-orbitals by absorbing energy from visible light, and the colour observed is the complementary colour of the light absorbed. Row B correctly lists all three of these characteristic properties.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. While it correctly states that transition elements have high melting points, it incorrectly states that they have low densities and do not form coloured compounds. Transition elements are known for being dense and for the vibrant colours of their compounds (e.g., copper(II) sulfate is blue, potassium permanganate is purple).\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect as it inaccurately describes all three properties.

A key physical property of metals is their ability to conduct heat efficiently. This is due to the presence of a lattice of positive metal ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These free-moving electrons can transfer kinetic energy (thermal energy) rapidly throughout the structure, making metals good thermal conductors.\n\nChemically, zinc's reactivity is determined by its position in the reactivity series. Zinc is located above hydrogen in this series, indicating that it is more reactive than hydrogen. Consequently, zinc will react with dilute acids (such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) in a single displacement reaction.

If the container corrodes, it could contaminate the food with harmful metal compounds, making it unsafe for consumption, and also compromise the structural integrity of the container. Therefore, resistance to corrosion is an essential property for any metal used to store food.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The primary property required for shaping metal into car bodies is **malleability**, which is the ability to be hammered or pressed into shape without breaking. While the metal must also be strong and resistant to corrosion, **ductility** (the ability to be drawn into a wire) is not the main property needed for manufacturing the large, shaped panels of a car body.\n\n**B:** For cutlery, good heat conduction is an **undesirable** property.

It does not react with water to form an acid and therefore does not contribute to acid rain.

Carbon monoxide is a neutral oxide and does not contribute to the formation of acid in the atmosphere.

The chemical process involves the oxidation of iron metal to iron(III) ions (Fe\u00b3\u207a). These ions combine with oxygen and water to form a complex, flaky, reddish-brown solid. The chemical formula for this substance is generally written as Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O, which represents hydrated iron(III) oxide. The \"(III)\" indicates the +3 oxidation state of the iron, and \"hydrated\" signifies that a variable number of water molecules (nH\u2082O) are incorporated into the compound's structure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the term \"anhydrous\" means without water. The process of rusting specifically requires water, and the resulting product is hydrated, meaning it contains water molecules within its structure. Secondly, rust consists of iron in the +3 oxidation state (iron(III)). Iron(II) oxide contains iron in the +2 oxidation state. Although iron(II) ions are formed as an intermediate during the rusting process, they are further oxidized to iron(III) ions to form the final product.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nWhile rust does contain iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), the term \"anhydrous\" is incorrect. Anhydrous means that the compound does not contain any water molecules. Rusting is a process that necessitates the presence of water, which becomes chemically incorporated into the final product. Therefore, rust is a hydrated compound. Anhydrous iron(III) oxide is a distinct substance that is not formed under the typical conditions of rusting.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nAlthough iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)\u2083) is chemically similar to hydrated iron(III) oxide and can be formed in related reactions, the term most accurately and specifically used to describe rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O).

Aluminium oxide has an extremely high melting point of over 2000 \u00b0C, which would require vast amounts of energy to melt. To make the process economically viable, the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na\u2083AlF\u2086). Cryolite acts as a solvent, creating a solution that has a much lower melting point, around 950-1000 \u00b0C. By dissolving the aluminium oxide, cryolite allows the aluminium ions (Al\u00b3\u207a) and oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) to become mobile, enabling the mixture to conduct electricity and undergo electrolysis at a more manageable temperature.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: It protects the anodes from corrosion.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The anodes in the electrolytic cell are made of carbon (graphite). During electrolysis, oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) from the dissolved aluminium oxide are attracted to the positive anode. Here, they are oxidised to form oxygen gas (O\u2082). At the high operating temperatures of the cell, this highly reactive oxygen gas immediately reacts with the carbon anode, forming carbon dioxide (C(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g)). This reaction causes the anodes to corrode and be gradually consumed, meaning they must be replaced periodically. Therefore, cryolite does not protect the anodes; the process itself inherently leads to their corrosion.\n\n**C: It changes bauxite to aluminium oxide.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bauxite is the primary ore from which aluminium is extracted. Bauxite is first purified to produce pure aluminium oxide (alumina) in a separate chemical procedure called the Bayer process. The Bayer process involves treating the bauxite ore with a hot, concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide. Cryolite is not used in this purification stage; its role is exclusively within the subsequent electrolytic cell.\n\n**D: It decreases the melting point of the aluminium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Cryolite decreases the melting point of the *aluminium oxide* (the electrolyte), not the *aluminium metal* (the product). The melting point of pure aluminium is approximately 660 \u00b0C. The electrolytic cell operates at around 950-1000 \u00b0C, which is well above the melting point of aluminium. As aluminium metal is produced at the cathode, it is already in a molten state and collects at the bottom of the cell. The crucial role of cryolite is to lower the operating temperature required to melt the electrolyte, not to change the physical properties of the final metallic product."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_69.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "29 awax candle is made from a mixture of hydrocarbons.\nthe candle is lit and placed in a gas jar along with a strip of cobalt(ii) chloride test paper as\nshown.\ncobalt(ii) chloride paper gas jar\n\ncombustion products\nwax candle\n\nafter a short time, the oxygen in the jar is used up and the candle flame goes out.\n\nwhich substance does the cobalt(ii) chloride paper identify?\n\na carbon dioxide\n\nb_ carbon monoxide\n\nc sulfur dioxide\n\nd_ water", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nA wax candle is made from hydrocarbons, which are compounds containing hydrogen and carbon atoms.

The molecular formula for but-2-ene is C\u2084H\u2088. The empirical formula is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms, which for C\u2084H\u2088 is CH\u2082 (dividing the subscripts by 4).

But-2-ene has the structural formula CH\u2083CH=CHCH\u2083 and the same general formula as butane.**\nThis statement is incorrect because but-2-ene and butane belong to different homologous series and thus have different general formulas. But-2-ene is an alkene with the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099. Butane is an alkane with the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082.

The defining feature of alkenes is the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond is a region of high electron density, making alkenes highly reactive.\n\nAqueous bromine, which has a characteristic reddish-brown colour, is used as a chemical test for unsaturation. When propene is mixed with aqueous bromine, it undergoes a rapid electrophilic addition reaction. The double bond in the propene molecule breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each of the two carbon atoms that were part of the double bond.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nCH\u2083CH=CH\u2082 (propene) + Br\u2082 (bromine) \u2192 CH\u2083CH(Br)CH\u2082(Br) (1,2-dibromopropane)\n\nThe product, 1,2-dibromopropane, is a colourless compound. As the coloured bromine (Br\u2082) is consumed in the reaction, the reddish-brown solution rapidly becomes colourless. This rapid decolourisation is the positive result for the test for an unsaturated compound.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. propane:** Propane is an alkane, a saturated hydrocarbon. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single carbon-carbon bonds (C-C) and do not have the reactive C=C double bond found in alkenes. Alkanes can react with bromine, but they do so through a slow substitution reaction that requires the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. They do not undergo rapid addition reactions and will not decolourise aqueous bromine under normal laboratory conditions.\n\n**B. propanoic acid:** Propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid. Although it contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) within its carboxyl functional group (-COOH), its carbon chain is saturated with only C-C single bonds. The C=O double bond is not reactive towards bromine in an addition reaction. Therefore, propanoic acid does not react with or decolourise aqueous bromine.\n\n**C. propanol:** Propanol is an alcohol. It is a saturated compound, meaning its carbon skeleton consists of only single C-C bonds. It lacks the C=C double bond necessary to undergo an addition reaction with bromine.

However, the product of the reaction with bromine is incorrect. The formula CH\u2083CH\u2082Br represents bromoethane. This molecule would be formed by the addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) to ethene, not by the addition of bromine (Br\u2082).

This process repeats to form a long polymer chain.\n\nStructure B correctly depicts this. It shows a repeating unit formed from a dicarboxylic acid derivative (represented by the black box flanked by two C=O groups) and a diol derivative (represented by the white box flanked by two oxygen atoms). The linkage between these units is the characteristic ester link (-COO-).\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A is incorrect.**\n\nThis structure shows the formation of an **amide link** (-CONH-). This type of linkage is characteristic of polyamides, such as nylon. Polyamides are formed from the condensation polymerization of a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine (a compound with two -NH\u2082 groups), not a diol. Since PET is a polyester, it must contain ester links, not amide links.\n\n**C is incorrect.**\n\nSimilar to option A, this structure also shows an **amide link** (-CONH-). Polymers with amide links are polyamides. PET is a polyester and is characterized by ester links (-COO-).

This results in the formation of a haloalkane, specifically chloroethane (C\u2082H\u2085Cl). The hydrogen atom that was displaced from the ethane molecule combines with the second chlorine atom from the Cl\u2082 molecule to form hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation for this monosubstitution reaction is:\nC\u2082H\u2086 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 C\u2082H\u2085Cl + HCl\n\nThis equation correctly represents the replacement of one atom (H) with another (Cl) and shows the correct products, which is characteristic of a substitution reaction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A.

This process occurs in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. The question asks for the number of different products containing a single carbon atom.\n\nThe possible substitution reactions are as follows:\n\n1.  **First Substitution:** One hydrogen atom in methane is replaced by a chlorine atom to form chloromethane.\n    *   CH\u2084 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2083Cl + HCl\n    *   Product 1: Chloromethane (CH\u2083Cl)\n\n2.  **Second Substitution:** The chloromethane produced can react further with chlorine, replacing a second hydrogen atom.\n    *   CH\u2083Cl + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2082Cl\u2082 + HCl\n    *   Product 2: Dichloromethane (CH\u2082Cl\u2082)\n\n3.  **Third Substitution:** Dichloromethane can react again, replacing a third hydrogen atom.\n    *   CH\u2082Cl\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CHCl\u2083 + HCl\n    *   Product 3: Trichloromethane (CHCl\u2083), also known as chloroform.\n\n4.  **Fourth Substitution:** Finally, trichloromethane can react, replacing the last remaining hydrogen atom.\n    *   CHCl\u2083 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CCl\u2084 + HCl\n    *   Product 4: Tetrachloromethane (CCl\u2084), also known as carbon tetrachloride.\n\nAfter this stage, no further substitution is possible as there are no hydrogen atoms left on the carbon atom.

While the reaction can be stopped to yield mainly the first two products (chloromethane and dichloromethane), the substitution process does not necessarily stop there. The reaction is a sequential process, and as long as both chlorine and hydrogen atoms on the carbon-containing molecule are available, further substitutions can and do occur. This option fails to account for the formation of trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane.\n\n**B) 3:** This is incorrect. This option omits one of the possible substituted products. The substitution reaction continues in a stepwise manner until all four hydrogen atoms on the original methane molecule have been replaced by chlorine atoms. Counting only three products means prematurely stopping the reaction sequence before the final possible product, tetrachloromethane (CCl\u2084), is formed.\n\n**D) 5:** This is incorrect. A methane molecule (CH\u2084) has only four hydrogen atoms that can be substituted. Once all four hydrogen atoms have been replaced by chlorine atoms, forming tetrachloromethane (CCl\u2084), no further substitution reactions on that molecule are possible.

The R\u0192 value is the distance travelled by the solute (2 cm for M) divided by the distance travelled by the solvent (10 cm), which equals 0.2. The value of 5.0 is the inverse of this ratio (10/2). An R\u0192 value can never be greater than 1, as the solute cannot travel further than the solvent front.

However, it provides an incorrect R\u0192 value for M. The R\u0192 value is calculated by dividing the distance moved by the spot by the distance moved by the solvent front (R\u0192 = 2 cm / 10 cm = 0.2). The value of 5.0 is an incorrect calculation.

When nitrogen gas is heated, its molecules absorb thermal energy, which is converted into kinetic energy. This causes the molecules to move more rapidly and randomly. Therefore, statement 2, \"They move more quickly,\" is correct.\n\nAs the molecules move more quickly, they collide with each other and the inner walls of the balloon more frequently and with greater force. This increased force exerted on the flexible walls of the balloon causes it to expand. As the volume of the balloon increases while the number of nitrogen molecules remains constant, the average distance between the molecules increases.

Heating a substance increases the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since kinetic energy is directly related to the speed of the molecules (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2), an increase in kinetic energy means the average speed of the molecules must increase. Their speed does not remain unchanged.\n\n**C. 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false. The problem states that the balloon expands, which means its volume increases.

They do not remain the same distance apart.\n\n**D. 3 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 3 and 4 are false.

For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile charge carriers. In the solid state, the ions in magnesium oxide are not free to move; they can only vibrate in their fixed positions. Therefore, solid magnesium oxide does not conduct electricity. However, when magnesium oxide is melted, a large amount of energy overcomes the strong electrostatic forces holding the lattice together. The ions are then free to move (mobile) and can act as charge carriers, allowing the molten compound to conduct electricity. This statement is entirely correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 1 is false.\n\n*   **Statement 1: \"Magnesium ions are smaller than oxide ions because they contain fewer electrons.\"**\n    This statement is incorrect because the reasoning is flawed. A magnesium atom (atomic number 12) loses two electrons to form a Mg\u00b2\u207a ion, which has 10 electrons (electron configuration 2, 8) and 12 protons. An oxygen atom (atomic number 8) gains two electrons to form an O\u00b2\u207b ion, which also has 10 electrons (electron configuration 2, 8) and 8 protons. Both ions have the same number of electrons, so the reason \"because they contain fewer electrons\" is false.\n    The Mg\u00b2\u207a ion is indeed smaller than the O\u00b2\u207b ion, but this is because the 12 protons in the magnesium nucleus exert a stronger electrostatic pull on the 10 electrons than the 8 protons in the oxygen nucleus, drawing the electron shells in more tightly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 1 and 3 are false.\n\n*   **Statement 1: \"Magnesium ions are smaller than oxide ions because they contain fewer electrons.\"**\n    This statement provides an incorrect reason for the size difference. Both Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b ions are isoelectronic, meaning they have the same number of electrons (10). The size difference is due to the difference in nuclear charge (number of protons), not the number of electrons.\n*   **Statement 3: \"Magnesium oxide has a high melting point because of the strong electrostatic attraction between the ions and delocalised electrons in the giant lattice.\"**\n    This statement incorrectly describes the bonding in magnesium oxide. While it is true that magnesium oxide has a high melting point due to strong electrostatic attraction, this attraction is between the positively charged magnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a) and the negatively charged oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b). The reference to \"delocalised electrons\" is incorrect; delocalised electrons are characteristic of metallic bonding, not ionic bonding.

Carbon is in Group 14 of the Periodic Table and has four outer-shell (valence) electrons. Hydrogen is in Group 1 and has one outer-shell electron. To form a stable molecule, the central carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds, one with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Each bond consists of one electron from the carbon atom and one electron from a hydrogen atom. Consequently, all four of carbon's valence electrons and the single valence electron from each of the four hydrogen atoms are used to form these bonds.

Magnesium powder consists of very small particles, which collectively have a much larger total surface area than a single piece of magnesium ribbon of the same mass. This larger surface area exposes a greater number of magnesium atoms to the hydrochloric acid particles at any given time. Consequently, the frequency of collisions between magnesium atoms and acid particles is significantly increased. A higher frequency of collisions leads to a higher frequency of successful collisions (those with sufficient energy), resulting in a faster rate of reaction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The magnesium atoms in the powder have a lower activation energy.**\nActivation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur. This value is determined by the nature of the chemical bonds being broken and formed in the reaction. Changing the physical form of a reactant from a ribbon to a powder does not change its chemical nature or the reaction pathway. Therefore, the activation energy for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid is the same, regardless of whether the magnesium is in powder or ribbon form.\n\n**B. The powder has a smaller surface area.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. For a given mass of a solid, dividing it into smaller particles (like a powder) dramatically increases the total surface area. A magnesium ribbon has a relatively small surface area exposed to the acid. In contrast, the tiny particles of magnesium powder have a very large combined surface area. An increased surface area leads to a faster reaction rate, not a slower one.\n\n**D. The magnesium atoms in the powder have greater kinetic energy.**\nThe average kinetic energy of particles is a measure of their temperature. For the comparison to be fair, it is assumed that both the magnesium powder and the magnesium ribbon are at the same temperature before the reaction. Changing the physical size of the magnesium pieces does not affect the temperature or the average kinetic energy of the magnesium atoms. Therefore, the atoms in the powder do not have greater kinetic energy than those in the ribbon."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_95.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "15 which row shows the conditions used in the contact process?\n[ee [rae\na iron 2 100\nb iron 200 450\ncc vanadium(v) oxide 2 450\nd vanadium(v) oxide 200 100", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe Contact process is the industrial method for manufacturing sulfuric acid.

The defining characteristic of a strong acid is that it completely dissociates (or ionises) in an aqueous solution.

The reaction of an ammonium salt to produce ammonia gas is a characteristic reaction of a base (specifically, a strong alkali), not an acid.

This is due to the increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius, which makes it more difficult for an atom to lose its valence electrons. Elements on the left side of a period are typically metals, those in the middle are metalloids, and those on the right are non-metals.\n\nThe elements in option D are sodium (Na), silicon (Si), and chlorine (Cl). All three are in Period 3 of the Periodic Table. Sodium is in Group 1 and is a reactive alkali metal. Silicon is in Group 14 and is a metalloid, exhibiting properties of both metals and non-metals. Chlorine is in Group 17 and is a typical non-metal (a halogen).

This sequence shows the trend down a group. Metallic character increases down a group, as the atomic radius increases and the ionisation energy decreases, making it easier for atoms to lose their outer electrons.\n\n**B. fluorine \u2192 bromine \u2192 iodine**\nThis set of elements is incorrect because fluorine (F), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) are all located in Group 17 (the halogens), not in the same period.

In contrast, ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH) is a weak acid, meaning it only partially dissociates in water, establishing an equilibrium where most of the acid remains as undissociated molecules.\n\n2.  **Hydrogen Ion Concentration ([H\u207a]):** Because hydrochloric acid completely dissociates, the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to the initial concentration of the acid. Since ethanoic acid only partially dissociates, the concentration of hydrogen ions it produces is significantly lower than the initial concentration of the acid. Therefore, at the same initial concentration, the hydrogen ion concentration of ethanoic acid is **lower** than that of hydrochloric acid.\n\n3.  **pH:** The pH scale is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, defined by the equation pH = -log\u2081\u2080[H\u207a]. This is an inverse logarithmic relationship, meaning that a lower concentration of H\u207a ions results in a higher pH value. Since the [H\u207a] of ethanoic acid is lower than that of hydrochloric acid, its pH will be **higher**.\n\nThus, compared to hydrochloric acid, ethanoic acid has a lower hydrogen ion concentration and a higher pH.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A: higher [H\u207a], higher pH**\nThis is incorrect. Ethanoic acid is a weak acid and dissociates less than the strong acid hydrochloric acid, so it produces a *lower* hydrogen ion concentration. Furthermore, a higher hydrogen ion concentration would result in a *lower* pH, not a higher one, due to the inverse logarithmic relationship between [H\u207a] and pH.\n\n**B: higher [H\u207a], lower pH**\nThis is incorrect. As a weak acid, ethanoic acid has a *lower* hydrogen ion concentration than hydrochloric acid at the same concentration. While a higher [H\u207a] would correctly correspond to a lower pH, the initial premise that ethanoic acid has a higher [H\u207a] is false.\n\n**D: lower [H\u207a], lower pH**\nThis is incorrect. The first part is correct: ethanoic acid does have a *lower* hydrogen ion concentration than hydrochloric acid. However, a lower hydrogen ion concentration corresponds to a *higher* pH, not a lower one. The pH scale is inverse to the H\u207a concentration. A lower pH indicates a stronger acid, which contradicts the fact that ethanoic acid is weaker than hydrochloric acid."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_103.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "23 what is a typical property of transition elements?\na canactas catalysts\nb poor electrical conductivity\nclow melting point\nd_ low density", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: A**\n\nTransition elements and their compounds are widely used as catalysts in industrial and biological processes. This catalytic activity is a key characteristic property. It stems from their ability to exist in variable oxidation states, which allows them to form unstable intermediate compounds. By providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, they increase the rate of reaction without being consumed in the process. For example, iron is used as a catalyst in the Haber process for ammonia synthesis, and vanadium(V) oxide is used in the Contact process for producing sulfuric acid.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B. poor electrical conductivity**\nThis statement is incorrect. Transition elements are metals and, like other metals, are excellent electrical conductors. Electrical conductivity in metals is due to the presence of delocalised electrons that are free to move throughout the metallic lattice. When a potential difference is applied, these mobile electrons flow and carry an electric current. Therefore, transition elements exhibit good, not poor, electrical conductivity.\n\n**C. low melting point**\nThis statement is incorrect. Transition elements are characterized by high melting and boiling points. This is because they have strong metallic bonds. The strength of the metallic bond is determined by the number of delocalised electrons and the charge on the metal ion. Transition elements can delocalise electrons from both their outermost s-orbital and their d-orbitals, resulting in a large number of mobile electrons and a strong electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the \"sea\" of delocalised electrons. This requires a large amount of energy to overcome, leading to high melting points.\n\n**D. low density**\nThis statement is incorrect. Transition elements typically have high densities. Density is a measure of mass per unit volume. As you move across a period in the periodic table, the atomic mass of the transition elements increases significantly, while the atomic radius either decreases or changes only slightly due to the increasing nuclear charge. This means more mass is being packed into a similar or smaller volume, resulting in high density. For example, elements like iron, copper, and gold are all dense metals."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_104.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "24 which statement about copper or aluminium is correct?\na_ aluminium is more dense than copper.\nb_ aluminium is less reactive than copper.\nc copper has high ductility.\nd copper has poor electrical conductivity.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**C. Copper has high ductility.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Ductility is a physical property of metals that allows them to be stretched or drawn into thin wires without breaking. Copper is a highly ductile metal, which, combined with its excellent electrical conductivity, makes it the primary material used for manufacturing electrical wires and cables.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Aluminium is more dense than copper.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. Copper has a density of approximately 8.96 g/cm\u00b3, while aluminium has a density of approximately 2.70 g/cm\u00b3. Therefore, copper is significantly more dense than aluminium. Aluminium is known for being a lightweight metal due to its low density.\n\n**B. Aluminium is less reactive than copper.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of a metal is determined by its position in the reactivity series. Aluminium is placed higher in the reactivity series than copper, indicating that aluminium is a more reactive metal. Although aluminium is highly reactive, it often appears unreactive because its surface quickly reacts with oxygen in the air to form a very thin, tough, and unreactive protective layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083). This layer prevents the metal underneath from further reaction.\n\n**D. Copper has poor electrical conductivity.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Copper is an excellent electrical conductor.

The first major purification step is filtration. In this process, the water is passed through large beds of sand and gravel. These layers act as a physical barrier, trapping and removing the insoluble solid particles, which makes the water clear.\n\n**Process 2: Chlorination**\nAfter filtration, the water is visually clear but may still contain harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, which are too small to be removed by filtration. To make the water safe for drinking (potable), a disinfectant is added. Chlorination is the most common method, involving the addition of a small, carefully controlled amount of chlorine. The chlorine kills the pathogenic microorganisms, preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.\n\nTherefore, filtration (Process 1) removes the solid particles, and chlorination (Process 2) disinfects the water, making it safe to drink. This is the standard, effective, and logical sequence used in water treatment works.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: chlorination, filtration**\nThis option presents the processes in the incorrect order. If chlorination were performed first, the chlorine would react with the suspended organic matter and other solids in the unfiltered water, reducing its effectiveness as a disinfectant and requiring larger amounts of chlorine. Furthermore, the subsequent filtration process would remove the residual chlorine that is intended to remain in the water to keep it protected from re-contamination as it travels through the distribution system to consumers.\n\n**C: fractional distillation, filtration**\nFractional distillation is a laboratory or industrial process used to separate liquids with different boiling points. It is not used for municipal water purification because it is extremely energy-intensive and prohibitively expensive for treating the vast quantities of water required for a town or city. Water purification for drinking does not require the separation of components with different boiling points. Additionally, the order is illogical; filtration to remove solids would precede any other purification step.\n\n**D: filtration, fractional distillation**\nWhile filtration is the correct first step, the second step, fractional distillation, is incorrect for municipal water purification. As explained above, fractional distillation is an economically unfeasible and unnecessary process for producing drinking water on a large scale.

The principle at work is called **sacrificial protection**.\n\n1.  **Reactivity Series:** In the reactivity series, magnesium (Mg) is more reactive than iron (Fe). This means magnesium has a greater tendency to lose electrons (get oxidized) compared to iron.\n2.  **Electrochemical Cell:** When blocks of magnesium are attached to the steel (mostly iron) hull of a boat in the presence of an electrolyte (seawater), an electrochemical cell is formed.\n3.  **Sacrificial Anode:** Because magnesium is more reactive, it acts as the anode and is preferentially oxidized.

Fe\u2082O\u2083 + 3Mg \u2192 2Fe + 3MgO**\n\nThis equation shows a displacement reaction where magnesium reduces iron(III) oxide (rust) back to iron metal. While this demonstrates that magnesium is more reactive than iron, it describes a reaction with existing rust.

The starting materials for industrial cracking are typically large alkanes obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil. Therefore, hydrocarbon P is an alkane.\n*   **Compound Q:** P is cracked to produce compound Q and hydrogen (H\u2082). The cracking of an alkane to form a smaller hydrocarbon and hydrogen is a dehydrogenation reaction.

In this specific reaction, a dicarboxylic acid monomer reacts with a diamine monomer.\n\nThe reaction occurs between the functional groups at the ends of the monomers: the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and the amine group (-NH\u2082). During the reaction, the hydroxyl group (-OH) from a carboxylic acid group combines with a hydrogen atom (-H) from an amine group. These two parts are eliminated and form a water molecule (H\u2082O). The remaining parts of the monomers then join together, forming a new covalent bond between the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid and the nitrogen atom of the amine. This new link is called an amide linkage (-CO-NH-). Because this process repeats along the chain, a long polymer molecule (a polyamide) is formed, with one molecule of water released for each amide link created.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: NH\u2083**\nAmmonia (NH\u2083) is not released in this reaction. The amine functional group (-NH\u2082) on the diamine monomer reacts, but it does so by losing only one of its hydrogen atoms. The nitrogen atom and the other hydrogen atom become part of the amide linkage that forms the polymer backbone.

The carbon atom from the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), including its double bond to an oxygen atom (the carbonyl group, C=O), is incorporated into the polymer's structure as part of the amide linkage (-CO-NH-).

Carbon dioxide is an acidic gas, forming carbonic acid in water. However, carbon dioxide is not a reducing agent and therefore will not decolourise potassium manganate(VII). In CO\u2082, the carbon atom is in its highest possible oxidation state (+4) and cannot be oxidised further by KMnO\u2084.\n\n**B) Nitrogen:** Nitrogen is the main component of air and is very unreactive. It does not \"burn\" in air under normal conditions. A very large amount of energy, such as in a lightning strike or a car engine, is required for it to react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. Although some nitrogen oxides are acidic gases, nitrogen's high stability and reluctance to burn make it an incorrect choice.\n\n**C) Magnesium:** Magnesium is a metal. It burns in air with a bright white flame to produce magnesium oxide (MgO), which is a white solid, not a gas. As a metal oxide, magnesium oxide is basic, not acidic. It reacts with water to form an alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)\u2082). Therefore, magnesium does not produce an acidic gas upon burning."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_121.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "1. agas is heated. the pressure is kept constant.\nwhich statement describes the behaviour of the particles in the gas?\na_ the particles move faster and become closer together.\nb_ the particles move faster and become further apart.\nc_ the particles move more slowly and become closer together.\nd_ the particles move more slowly and become further apart.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. The particles move faster and become further apart.**\n\nAccording to the kinetic particle theory, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. When a gas is heated, it absorbs thermal energy, which increases the kinetic energy of its particles. This causes the particles to move more rapidly and randomly.\n\nPressure in a gas is created by the force of the particles colliding with the walls of their container. If the gas is heated, the faster-moving particles will collide with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. To keep the pressure constant, the volume of the gas must increase. This expansion allows the particles to travel greater distances between collisions with the walls, which counteracts the effect of their increased speed, thus maintaining a constant pressure. An increase in volume means the average distance between the particles increases, so they become further apart. This relationship is described by Charles's Law, which states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The particles move faster and become closer together.**\n\nWhile it is correct that heating causes the particles to move faster, the second part of the statement is incorrect. If the particles were to become closer together, the volume of the gas would decrease. Faster-moving particles in a smaller volume would lead to more frequent and more forceful collisions with the container walls, resulting in a significant increase in pressure. This contradicts the condition that the pressure is kept constant.\n\n**C. The particles move more slowly and become closer together.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because heating a gas increases the kinetic energy of its particles, causing them to move faster, not slower. The process described here\u2014particles moving more slowly and becoming closer together\u2014corresponds to cooling a gas at constant pressure, which is the opposite of what is happening.\n\n**D. The particles move more slowly and become further apart.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because heating causes particles to gain kinetic energy and move faster, not slower. Furthermore, the two conditions described (moving more slowly and becoming further apart) are contradictory for a gas at constant pressure. If a gas were cooled (particles move slower), its volume would decrease, and the particles would become closer together to maintain constant pressure."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_122.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "2  amixture of ice and water is left to stand and the ice melts.\nwhich row describes what happens as the ice is melting?\ntemperature of aneray change\nmixture gy 9\na increases average kinetic energy of particles decreases\nb increases energy is used to overcome attractive forces\ncc stays the same average kinetic energy of particles decreases\nd stays the same energy is used to overcome attractive forces", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nMelting is a phase change from solid to liquid that occurs at a constant temperature, known as the melting point.

The energy absorbed from the surroundings during this process is called the latent heat of fusion.

When it comes into contact with the moisture present on the universal indicator paper, it dissolves and reacts with water to form sulfurous acid (H\u2082SO\u2083), which is an acidic solution.\n    SO\u2082(g) + H\u2082O(l) \u21cc H\u2082SO\u2083(aq)\n    Acids cause universal indicator paper to turn red (or orange/yellow for weaker acids, but red is the expected colour for acidic gases in this context). Therefore, the universal indicator paper turns red. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n2.  **Rate of Diffusion:** The movement of gas particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration is called diffusion. The rate of diffusion is dependent on the relative molecular mass (M\u1d63) of the gas. According to Graham's Law of Diffusion, gases with a lower M\u1d63 diffuse faster than gases with a higher M\u1d63.\n    *   The relative molecular mass of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is 36.5.\n    *   The relative molecular mass of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is 64.\n    Since SO\u2082 has a higher M\u1d63 than HCl, it is a heavier gas and will diffuse more slowly. Consequently, it will take a longer time for SO\u2082 to travel from point P to the universal indicator paper compared to HCl. The time taken for HCl was 38 s, so the time for SO\u2082 must be greater than 38 s.

Sulfur dioxide is an acidic gas, so it would turn universal indicator red, not blue. Furthermore, as SO\u2082 (M\u1d63 = 64) is heavier than HCl (M\u1d63 = 36.5), it would diffuse more slowly and take a longer time than 38 s, not a shorter time like 26 s.\n\n*   **B: blue, 51 s**\n    This is incorrect because sulfur dioxide is an acidic gas and turns universal indicator red, not blue. Although the time (51 s) is correctly predicted to be longer than for HCl, the colour change is wrong.\n\n*   **C: red, 26 s**\n    This is incorrect. While the red colour change is correct, the time is not. Sulfur dioxide has a higher relative molecular mass than hydrogen chloride, so it diffuses more slowly.

These electrons are involved in forming chemical bonds and participating in chemical reactions. Isotopes are atoms of the same element, meaning they have the same number of protons in their nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Therefore, all isotopes of a particular element have the same number of electrons and, consequently, the same electronic configuration.

The properties of potassium chloride are characteristic of ionic compounds.\n\n**Correct Statements:**\n\n*   **Statement 3: Its structure is a giant lattice of alternating positive and negative ions.** This is a correct description of an ionic compound.

Water is a polar solvent. The partially positive hydrogen atoms in water molecules are attracted to the negative chloride ions (Cl\u207b), and the partially negative oxygen atoms are attracted to the positive potassium ions (K\u207a). These attractions are strong enough to overcome the forces holding the ions together in the lattice, causing the potassium chloride to dissolve.\n\n**Incorrect Statements:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: It conducts electricity when solid because its ions are free to move.** This is incorrect. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain mobile charge carriers. In solid potassium chloride, the ions (K\u207a and Cl\u207b) are held in fixed positions within the rigid giant ionic lattice.

Shared electrons are the valence electrons that participate in forming covalent bonds.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N\u2082):** A nitrogen atom is in Group 15 of the Periodic Table, so it has 5 valence electrons. To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell of 8 electrons, or an octet), each nitrogen atom needs to gain 3 electrons. In a molecule of nitrogen (N\u2082), the two nitrogen atoms achieve this by forming a **triple covalent bond**. A triple bond consists of three shared pairs of electrons.

This would be the number of chloride ions in only 0.5 moles of MgCl\u2082, or the number of MgCl\u2082 formula units in one mole of the substance.

This calculation correctly determines the number of chloride ions in **one mole** of MgCl\u2082 (since 1 mole of MgCl\u2082 contains 2 moles of Cl\u207b ions). However, the question specifies **two moles** of MgCl\u2082. This answer could also represent the number of MgCl\u2082 formula units in two moles of the substance.

In electrolysis, oxidation (the loss of electrons) occurs at the anode. Since the anode is made of copper (an active electrode), the copper atoms of the anode are oxidised to form copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a), which then enter the electrolyte solution. This process releases two electrons per atom. The correct ionic half-equation for this oxidation reaction is:\n**Cu(s) \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b**\n\n**Observation of the Electrolyte:** The blue colour of the aqueous copper(II) sulfate electrolyte is due to the presence of hydrated copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a). During electroplating, two processes involving these ions occur simultaneously:\n1.  **At the cathode (the metal object):** Copper(II) ions from the electrolyte are reduced to form a layer of solid copper on the object (Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s)). This removes Cu\u00b2\u207a ions from the solution.\n2.  **At the anode:** The copper anode oxidises to produce new copper(II) ions (Cu(s) \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b). This replenishes the Cu\u00b2\u207a ions in the solution.\n\nBecause the rate at which copper(II) ions are removed from the solution at the cathode is equal to the rate at which they are produced at the anode, the overall concentration of copper(II) ions in the electrolyte remains constant. Consequently, the intensity of the **blue colour does not change**.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A:** The half-equation **Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu** represents reduction (gain of electrons), which occurs at the cathode, not the anode. Furthermore, if Cu\u00b2\u207a ions were being consumed without being replaced, the blue colour would fade, but this equation is incorrect for the anode.\n\n**B:** The half-equation **Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu** is incorrect for the anode. This is the reduction reaction that takes place at the cathode. Although the observation that the blue colour does not change is correct, the reason for it (the anode reaction) is wrong.\n\n**C:** The half-equation for the reaction at the anode, **Cu \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b**, is correct. However, the observation that the **blue colour fades** is incorrect. This would only occur if an inert anode (like platinum or graphite) were used, as the Cu\u00b2\u207a ions would be consumed at the cathode without being replenished by the anode.

The term itself is derived from Greek roots: 'electro' referring to electricity and 'lysis' meaning to break apart or decompose. By definition, electrolysis involves the decomposition of an ionic compound, known as the electrolyte, when it is in a molten state or dissolved in a suitable solvent (like water). The electric current provides the energy needed to break the chemical bonds within the compound, separating it into its constituent elements or simpler substances. For example, the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (NaCl) breaks it down into sodium metal and chlorine gas.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Chemical energy is converted to electrical energy.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes the energy conversion that occurs in a simple cell (also known as a galvanic or voltaic cell), not an electrolytic cell. In a simple cell, a spontaneous chemical reaction releases chemical energy, which is then converted into electrical energy, producing a flow of electrons. Electrolysis is the reverse process; it consumes electrical energy from an external power source to force a non-spontaneous chemical reaction to occur. Therefore, in electrolysis, electrical energy is converted into chemical energy.\n\n**B. Electrons flow through the electrolyte.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While an electrolyte conducts electricity, the charge is not carried by free-moving electrons. In the external circuit (the wires connecting the electrodes to the power supply), charge is indeed carried by the flow of electrons. However, within the electrolyte itself, the charge is carried by the movement of mobile ions. Positively charged ions (cations) move towards the negative electrode (cathode), and negatively charged ions (anions) move towards the positive electrode (anode). This movement of ions constitutes the electric current within the electrolyte.\n\n**D. Metals are formed at the positive electrode.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In electrolysis, the positive electrode is the anode, and the negative electrode is the cathode. Metals exist as positively charged ions (cations) in the electrolyte (e.g., Na\u207a, Cu\u00b2\u207a, Al\u00b3\u207a). Since opposite charges attract, these positive cations are attracted to the negative electrode (the cathode). At the cathode, the metal ions gain electrons in a process called reduction, forming neutral metal atoms which are then deposited on the electrode. For example, at the cathode during the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate solution, copper ions are reduced to form copper metal: Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s). Therefore, metals are formed at the negative electrode, not the positive one."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_135.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "15 the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen releases 486 kj/mol of energy.\n2h,(g) + o2(g) > 2h,o0(g)\n\nthe bond energy of h-h is 436 kj/mol and that of h\u2014o is 464 kj/mol.\nwhat is the bond energy of o=o?\n\na 430kj/mol\n\nb  458kj/mol\n\nc 498kj/mol\n\nd 984kj/mol", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe enthalpy change (\u0394H) of a reaction can be calculated by finding the difference between the energy required to break chemical bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming new bonds in the products.

A reaction that absorbs energy from its surroundings is called an endothermic reaction. Therefore, this change is endothermic, not exothermic.\n\n**C: physical**\nA physical change alters the form or state of a substance but does not change its chemical composition.

This means the magnesium carbonate is the **limiting reactant**. The total amount of carbon dioxide gas produced is determined entirely by the initial amount of magnesium carbonate, not the amount of the excess reactant.

The rate of a chemical reaction is affected by the concentration of the reactants. According to collision theory, doubling the concentration of hydrochloric acid increases the number of H\u207a ions per unit volume of the solution. This leads to a higher frequency of successful collisions between the acid particles and the magnesium carbonate particles. As a result, the rate of reaction increases.

This causes them to move faster and more vigorously.\n\n2.  **Increased Frequency of Effective Collisions (Statement 2):** The increased kinetic energy has two consequences. Firstly, because the particles are moving faster, they collide more often in a given period. This is an increase in the *frequency of collisions* (Statement 2). Secondly, and more significantly, the increased kinetic energy means that a greater proportion of the particles possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. Therefore, a larger fraction of the collisions that occur are \"effective\" or \"successful,\" meaning they have enough energy to result in a chemical reaction.\n\nBoth the increased frequency of collisions and the increased energy of those collisions contribute to a faster reaction rate.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**Option A: Statements 1 and 2**\n\nThis option is incorrect because statement 1 is false. The activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur. It is a fixed property for a specific chemical reaction and is determined by the nature of the reacting substances and the reaction pathway. Increasing the temperature provides particles with more energy to overcome this activation energy barrier, but it does not change the barrier itself. Only a catalyst can lower the activation energy.\n\n**Option B: Statements 1 and 4**\n\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 1 and 4 are false.\n*   **Statement 1:** As explained above, increasing the temperature does not increase the activation energy.\n*   **Statement 4:** Increasing the number of particles per unit volume relates to increasing the concentration (for solutions) or pressure (for gases), which are separate factors that affect reaction rate. While increasing temperature in a fixed-volume container of gas will increase pressure, it does not change the number of particles per unit volume (i.e., the concentration). Therefore, this is not a direct explanation for the effect of temperature.\n\n**Option D: Statements 3 and 4**\n\nThis option is incorrect because statement 4 is false. While statement 3 is a correct explanation (increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles), statement 4 is not. Increasing the number of particles per unit volume is a description of increasing concentration or pressure. Changing the temperature of a system does not inherently change the number of particles within a given volume. Therefore, this combination of statements is not the correct explanation."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_140.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "20 hydrogen is made by reacting carbon with steam. the equation for the reaction is shown.\nc(s) + h,0(g) = h,(g) + co(g)\nthe forward reaction is endothermic.\nwhich row describes changes in the pressure and the temperature that will both shift the position\nof equilibrium to the right?\n[sie [ere\na decrease decrease\nb decrease increase\nc increase decrease\nd increase increase", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis question requires the application of Le Chatelier's principle to determine how changes in temperature and pressure affect the position of a chemical equilibrium. The goal is to identify conditions that shift the equilibrium to the right, favouring the formation of products (H\u2082 and CO).\n\n**1. Effect of Temperature:**\nThe forward reaction is stated to be endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings (\u0394H > 0). According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs heat to counteract the change. In this case, that is the forward (endothermic) direction. Therefore, **increasing the temperature** will shift the equilibrium to the right.\n\n**2. Effect of Pressure:**\nPressure changes affect equilibria involving gases. Le Chatelier's principle states that if the pressure is changed, the equilibrium will shift to the side with the number of moles of gas that counteracts the change.\n*   **Reactants side:** There is 1 mole of gas (H\u2082O(g)). Note that carbon (C(s)) is a solid and is not included when considering the effect of pressure.\n*   **Products side:** There are 2 moles of gas (1 mole of H\u2082(g) + 1 mole of CO(g)).\nSince the product side has more moles of gas (2 moles) than the reactant side (1 mole), a **decrease in pressure** will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right, as this increases the number of gas molecules and thus helps to raise the pressure.\n\nCombining these two effects, a **decrease in pressure** and an **increase in temperature** will both shift the position of equilibrium to the right.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decrease pressure, decrease temperature**\nDecreasing the pressure correctly shifts the equilibrium to the right, as this favours the side with more moles of gas. However, decreasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left. This is because the reverse reaction is exothermic, and a decrease in temperature favours the exothermic direction to release heat and oppose the cooling effect.\n\n**C: increase pressure, decrease temperature**\nBoth of these changes would shift the equilibrium to the left. An increase in pressure favours the side with fewer moles of gas (the reactant side). A decrease in temperature favours the exothermic direction (the reverse reaction). Therefore, this combination would shift the equilibrium away from the products.\n\n**D: increase pressure, increase temperature**\nThese two changes have opposing effects on the equilibrium position. While an increase in temperature correctly shifts the equilibrium to the right (favouring the endothermic reaction), an increase in pressure would shift it to the left (favouring the side with fewer moles of gas).

However, at low temperatures, the reaction rate is too slow. A compromise temperature of approximately 450 \u00b0C is used to ensure a fast enough rate of reaction while still achieving a very high equilibrium yield (about 99.5%).\n*   **Pressure:** The forward reaction involves a decrease in the number of moles of gas (from 3 moles of reactants to 2 moles of products). According to Le Chatelier's principle, high pressure would favour the formation of sulfur trioxide. However, the equilibrium position already provides a high yield at lower pressures.

Magnesium is oxidised and carbon dioxide is reduced.**\n\nTo determine which species are oxidised and reduced, we can analyse the reaction in terms of the gain or loss of oxygen, or the change in oxidation states.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Magnesium (Mg):**\n    *   In the reactants, magnesium exists as an element (Mg).\n    *   In the products, magnesium has combined with oxygen to form magnesium oxide (MgO).\n    *   **Oxidation is the gain of oxygen.** Since magnesium gains oxygen, it is oxidised.\n    *   Alternatively, considering oxidation states: Mg as an element has an oxidation state of 0.

Magnesium is reduced and carbon dioxide is oxidised.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As explained above, magnesium gains oxygen to become magnesium oxide, which is oxidation, not reduction. Carbon dioxide loses its oxygen atoms to become carbon, which is reduction, not oxidation. This option reverses the correct processes.\n\n**C. Magnesium and carbon dioxide are both oxidised.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Oxidation and reduction are complementary processes that must occur together in a chemical reaction, known as a redox reaction. If one substance is oxidised (loses electrons/gains oxygen), another substance must be reduced (gains electrons/loses oxygen). It is not possible for both reactants to be oxidised.\n\n**D. Magnesium and carbon dioxide are neither oxidised nor reduced.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The reaction clearly shows a transfer of oxygen from carbon dioxide to magnesium. This transfer of oxygen is the definition of a redox reaction. Therefore, oxidation and reduction have occurred. A reaction where no oxidation or reduction occurs would involve no change in the oxidation states of the elements involved (e.g., a precipitation or neutralisation reaction)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_143.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "23 chlorine displaces bromine from aqueous potassium bromide.\nthe ionic equation for the reaction is shown.\ncl, + 2br \u2014 2cl + br,\nwhich statement about this reaction is correct?\na_ bromide ions act as an oxidising agent.\nb_ bromide ions are oxidised as electrons are lost.\nc_ chlorine acts as a reducing agent.\nd_ chlorine is reduced as electrons are lost.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn this reaction, the bromide ion (Br\u207b) starts with an oxidation state of -1. It is converted into elemental bromine (Br\u2082), where its oxidation state is 0. An increase in oxidation state (from -1 to 0) signifies oxidation. Oxidation is defined as the loss of electrons. The half-equation for this process is 2Br\u207b \u2192 Br\u2082 + 2e\u207b, which explicitly shows the loss of two electrons. Therefore, the statement that bromide ions are oxidised as electrons are lost is correct.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Bromide ions act as an oxidising agent.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An oxidising agent is a substance that causes oxidation in another species and is itself reduced (gains electrons). In this reaction, the bromide ions (Br\u207b) are themselves oxidised (they lose electrons) to form bromine (Br\u2082). Because bromide ions are oxidised, they act as a reducing agent, causing the reduction of chlorine.\n\n**C. Chlorine acts as a reducing agent.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A reducing agent is a substance that causes reduction in another species and is itself oxidised (loses electrons). In this reaction, chlorine (Cl\u2082) gains electrons to form chloride ions (Cl\u207b). The oxidation state of chlorine changes from 0 in Cl\u2082 to -1 in Cl\u207b. This process is reduction.

When ammonium chloride (NH\u2084Cl) is warmed with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, a displacement reaction occurs. The hydroxide ion (OH\u207b) from the sodium hydroxide is a stronger base than ammonia and therefore displaces the weaker base (ammonia, NH\u2083) from the ammonium salt.\n\nThe ammonium ion acts as an acid, donating a proton (H\u207a) to the hydroxide ion, which acts as a base. This acid-base reaction forms ammonia gas (NH\u2083) and water (H\u2082O). Warming the mixture reduces the solubility of ammonia in water, promoting its release as a gas. The sodium (Na\u207a) and chloride (Cl\u207b) ions remain in the solution as spectator ions, forming sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\nNH\u2084Cl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + NH\u2083(g)\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. chlorine**\nThe production of chlorine gas (Cl\u2082) requires the oxidation of chloride ions (Cl\u207b). This is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction, which typically requires a strong oxidising agent or electrolysis. The reaction between ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide is an acid-base displacement reaction, not a redox reaction. The conditions are not suitable for the oxidation of chloride ions to chlorine gas.\n\n**C. hydrogen**\nHydrogen gas (H\u2082) is typically produced in reactions involving a reactive metal and an acid (e.g., Zn + 2HCl \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082) or a very reactive metal and water (e.g., 2Na + 2H\u2082O \u2192 2NaOH + H\u2082).

A key characteristic of noble gases (except for Helium) is that they have a full outer electron shell, which contains eight electrons. This stable electron arrangement is known as a complete octet.

To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell of eight electrons), they form a single covalent bond with another atom of the same element. This results in the formation of diatomic molecules (e.g., F\u2082, Cl\u2082, Br\u2082). Therefore, their structure is diatomic.\n\nReactivity for halogens is determined by their ability to gain an electron to complete their outer shell. As you descend Group VII, the atomic radius increases because more electron shells are added. The increased number of inner electron shells also leads to greater electron shielding. Both of these factors reduce the effective nuclear attraction on the outermost electrons and on an incoming electron. Consequently, it becomes more difficult for an atom to attract and gain an electron, and thus the reactivity of the elements decreases down the group.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Why 'diatomic' and 'increases' is incorrect:**\nWhile it is correct that Group VII elements exist as diatomic molecules, their reactivity does not increase down the group. Reactivity for halogens is a measure of their ability to attract an electron. As we move down the group, the atomic size increases and the shielding effect of inner electrons becomes more pronounced. This weakens the nucleus's ability to attract an electron, causing reactivity to decrease, not increase.\n\n**C. Why 'monatomic' and 'increases' is incorrect:**\nThis statement is incorrect on both points. Group VII elements are not monatomic; they are unstable as single atoms and form diatomic molecules to achieve a stable electron arrangement. Furthermore, their reactivity decreases down the group due to increasing atomic radius and electron shielding, which makes it harder to gain an electron.\n\n**D.

Propanoic acid (CH\u2083CH\u2082COOH) is a carboxylic acid, which is a type of organic acid. Organic acids are weak acids. This means they only partially ionise in aqueous solution to release hydrogen ions (H\u207a). In contrast, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids fully ionise in aqueous solution, releasing a high concentration of H\u207a ions. Because propanoic acid produces a lower concentration of H\u207a ions than hydrochloric acid at the same molarity, it is a weaker acid.\n\n**Statement 2: Propanoic acid partially ionises in aqueous solution.**\nThis statement is correct. As explained above, propanoic acid is a weak acid. The defining characteristic of a weak acid is that it undergoes partial or incomplete ionisation (or dissociation) when dissolved in water. This process is reversible and establishes an equilibrium:\nCH\u2083CH\u2082COOH(aq) \u21cc H\u207a(aq) + CH\u2083CH\u2082COO\u207b(aq)\nOnly a small fraction of the propanoic acid molecules break down to form ions at any given time.\n\n**Statement 3: Propanoic acid reacts with ethanol to form propyl ethanoate.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reaction between a carboxylic acid (like propanoic acid) and an alcohol (like ethanol) is called esterification, which produces an ester and water. The naming of the ester follows a specific rule: the first part of the name comes from the alcohol, and the second part comes from the carboxylic acid.\n*   The alcohol is **eth**anol, so the first part of the ester's name is **ethyl**.\n*   The carboxylic acid is **propan**oic acid, so the second part of the name is **propanoate**.\nTherefore, the reaction between propanoic acid and ethanol produces **ethyl propanoate**, not propyl ethanoate. Propyl ethanoate would be formed from the reaction of **propanol** and **ethanoic acid**.\n\nSince statements 1 and 2 are correct and statement 3 is incorrect, the correct option is **B**.\n\n### Analysis of Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A (1, 2 and 3):** This option is incorrect because statement 3 is incorrect. The product of the reaction between propanoic acid and ethanol is ethyl propanoate, not propyl ethanoate.\n*   **C (1 and 3 only):** This option is incorrect because statement 3 is incorrect, and it omits the correct statement 2.

For rusting to occur, iron must be exposed to both oxygen and water. A continuous, non-porous layer of plastic acts as a physical barrier, preventing these two substances from reaching the iron's surface. As the reactants cannot come into contact with the iron, the electrochemical reactions that constitute rusting are prevented.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 4 (Correct):**\nRusting is an electrochemical process that involves the oxidation of iron. According to the definition of oxidation, it is the loss of electrons. During rusting, metallic iron atoms (Fe), which have an oxidation state of 0, are converted into iron(III) ions (Fe\u00b3\u207a), which have an oxidation state of +3. This transformation requires each iron atom to lose three electrons:\nFe \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3e\u207b\nTherefore, the statement that iron loses electrons when it rusts is correct.\n\n---\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n**Option A: 1 and 2**\n*   **Statement 1 is incorrect:** Rust is chemically known as hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O). It is not anhydrous (meaning without water), and the iron is in the +3 oxidation state (iron(III)), not the +2 oxidation state (iron(II)). Anhydrous iron(II) oxide (FeO) is a different chemical compound.\n*   **Statement 2 is incorrect:** This describes sacrificial protection. Zinc is more reactive than iron. When iron is in electrical contact with a more reactive metal like zinc, the more reactive metal corrodes (is oxidized) preferentially. Zinc acts as the sacrificial anode, donating electrons to the iron and protecting it from rusting. Consequently, iron rusts *more slowly*, not more quickly, when attached to zinc.\n\n**Option B: 1 and 4**\n*   **Statement 1 is incorrect:** As explained above, rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide, not anhydrous iron(II) oxide. Although statement 4 is correct, the combination is invalidated by the inaccuracy of statement 1.\n\n**Option C: 2 and 3**\n*   **Statement 2 is incorrect:** As explained above, attaching iron to zinc provides sacrificial protection, which slows down or prevents the rusting of iron.

Iron atoms are oxidised more easily than copper atoms.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The experimental results can be used to determine the relative reactivity of the metals iron, copper, and magnesium.\n\n1.  **Experiment 1: Iron nail in aqueous copper(II) sulfate.** A reaction occurs, and a brown solid (copper metal) is formed. This is a displacement reaction. The equation for this reaction is:\n    Fe(s) + CuSO\u2084(aq) \u2192 FeSO\u2084(aq) + Cu(s)\n    In this redox reaction, iron atoms (Fe) lose two electrons to form iron(II) ions (Fe\u00b2\u207a). This loss of electrons is oxidation. Copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) gain two electrons to form copper atoms (Cu). This gain of electrons is reduction. Since iron displaces copper from its salt solution, iron is more reactive than copper. More reactive metals are more easily oxidised. Therefore, iron atoms are oxidised more easily than copper atoms.\n\n2.  **Experiment 2: Iron nail in aqueous magnesium sulfate.** No reaction occurs. This indicates that iron is not reactive enough to displace magnesium from its salt solution. Therefore, iron is less reactive than magnesium. This means magnesium atoms are oxidised more easily than iron atoms.\n\nCombining these results gives the reactivity series: **Magnesium > Iron > Copper**. The ease of oxidation of the metal atoms follows the same order. Statement C correctly reflects the relationship between iron and copper.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Copper atoms are oxidised more easily than magnesium atoms.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The experiments establish a reactivity series of Magnesium > Iron > Copper. A higher position in the reactivity series corresponds to a greater ease of oxidation. Since magnesium is more reactive than copper, magnesium atoms are oxidised more easily than copper atoms.\n\n**B. Copper atoms are reduced more easily than iron ions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect and chemically imprecise. In these types of reactions, metal atoms are oxidised (lose electrons), and metal ions are reduced (gain electrons). The statement incorrectly compares the reduction of an atom (copper) with the reduction of an ion (iron ion). The relevant comparison is between the reduction of copper ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) and iron ions (Fe\u00b2\u207a). Based on the reactivity series (Fe > Cu), the ion of the less reactive metal is more easily reduced. Therefore, copper(II) ions are more easily reduced than iron(II) ions, not copper atoms.\n\n**D. Iron atoms are reduced more easily than copper ions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Firstly, as explained for option B, it makes a chemically imprecise comparison between the reduction of an atom and an ion. Secondly, in the first experiment, iron atoms are not reduced; they are oxidised (Fe \u2192 Fe\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b). It is the copper(II) ions that are reduced (Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu).

When these fertilisers are washed from agricultural land into water bodies, the high concentration of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) stimulates the rapid and excessive growth of algae, an event known as an algal bloom. This dense layer of algae on the water's surface blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic plants below, causing them to die. When the algae themselves die, they sink to the bottom. Aerobic bacteria then decompose this large mass of dead organic matter. This decomposition process consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to deoxygenation. The resulting low oxygen levels cannot support most aquatic animals, such as fish, which die as a result.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: toxic metal compounds**\nToxic metal compounds, such as those containing mercury, lead, or cadmium, are pollutants that are directly poisonous to aquatic organisms. They can bioaccumulate in the tissues of organisms and biomagnify through the food chain, causing severe health issues and death. However, their mechanism of harm is toxicity, not causing the nutrient enrichment that leads to algal blooms and subsequent deoxygenation.\n\n**C: combustion products of fossil fuels**\nThe primary combustion products of fossil fuels are carbon dioxide, water, sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. While sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contribute to acid rain (see D), and carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, these substances do not act as nutrients to stimulate the massive algal growth that is the root cause of deoxygenation in ponds and lakes.\n\n**D: acid rain**\nAcid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (from burning fossil fuels) react with water in the atmosphere. Acid rain lowers the pH of ponds and lakes, making them acidic. This acidification is directly harmful to aquatic life, as many species cannot tolerate the low pH levels. It damages gills, affects reproductive cycles, and can cause death.

For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this boiling point is precisely 100\u00b0C. The presence of dissolved impurities, such as salts, will elevate the boiling point, causing the water to boil at a temperature above 100\u00b0C and over a range of temperatures. Therefore, observing that a sample of water boils at exactly 100\u00b0C is a standard physical test used to confirm its purity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It melts at room temperature.**\nThis statement is not a valid test for purity. The melting point of pure water (ice) is a fixed temperature of 0\u00b0C. While ice would indeed be melted at room temperature (typically 20-25\u00b0C), this observation does not provide any information about its purity. Impure ice would also melt at room temperature, as its melting point would be depressed (lowered) slightly below 0\u00b0C, but still well below room temperature. A test for purity would require measuring the melting point to see if it is exactly 0\u00b0C.\n\n**B. It turns anhydrous copper(II) sulfate blue.**\nThis is a chemical test for the *presence* of water, not its purity. Anhydrous copper(II) sulfate is a white powder that turns blue upon hydration, forming hydrated copper(II) sulfate. This reaction will occur with both pure water and aqueous solutions (impure water). Therefore, a positive result only confirms that water is present in the sample, not that the sample is pure water.\n\n**C. It turns hydrated cobalt(II) chloride from blue to pink.**\nThis statement is chemically incorrect. The test for water uses *anhydrous* cobalt(II) chloride, which is blue. In the presence of water, it turns into *hydrated* cobalt(II) chloride, which is pink. The statement incorrectly describes the starting material and the colour change.

This conversion involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the nitrogen oxide molecules. In chemical terms, the loss of oxygen is defined as **reduction**.\n\nTo reduce the oxides of nitrogen, a reducing agent is required.

Therefore, the oxides of nitrogen undergo reduction, and they react with compound X, which is carbon monoxide.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: oxidation, carbon dioxide**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the oxides of nitrogen are converted to nitrogen gas (N\u2082), a process involving the loss of oxygen, which is reduction, not oxidation. Secondly, carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a product of the reaction in the catalytic converter, not a reactant that removes nitrogen oxides. Carbon dioxide is relatively stable and does not act as a reducing agent in this context.\n\n**B: oxidation, carbon monoxide**\nThis option correctly identifies carbon monoxide as the reactant (compound X) but incorrectly identifies the type of reaction for the oxides of nitrogen. To be converted into nitrogen gas (N\u2082), the nitrogen oxides must lose their oxygen atoms. The loss of oxygen is defined as reduction, not oxidation.

Ethene is produced by the cracking of long-chain alkanes. These alkanes are obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil. Crude oil is a fossil fuel, which is a finite and non-renewable resource. The dependence on a non-renewable resource is a major long-term disadvantage, as it is unsustainable and subject to price volatility and eventual depletion.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A: the energy cost is low**\n    This statement is incorrect. The catalytic addition of steam to ethene requires specific and demanding conditions to achieve a reasonable rate of reaction. These conditions include high temperatures (approximately 300 \u00b0C) and high pressures (around 60\u201370 atmospheres). Maintaining such high temperatures and pressures is energy-intensive, leading to high operational and energy costs. Therefore, a high energy cost is a disadvantage of this process, not a low one.\n\n*   **B: the process is continuous**\n    This statement describes an advantage, not a disadvantage. In a continuous process, reactants are constantly fed into the reactor, and products are continuously removed. This allows for automation, high-volume production, and greater efficiency and economy of scale compared to a batch process, where the reaction is carried out in discrete steps.\n\n*   **D: the ethanol is pure**\n    This statement is incorrect. The reaction between ethene and steam is reversible (C\u2082H\u2084 + H\u2082O \u21cc C\u2082H\u2085OH), meaning it reaches an equilibrium where reactants and products coexist. The conversion of ethene to ethanol in a single pass through the reactor is low (only about 5%). Consequently, the resulting mixture contains a significant amount of unreacted ethene and steam, along with the ethanol product. This impure mixture must undergo further separation steps (like fractional distillation) to isolate pure ethanol, which adds to the complexity and cost of the process."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_157.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "37 which statement about the polymer pet is correct?\na__itcan be broken down into its monomers and re-polymerised.\nb_itis an addition polymer.\nc_ itis a polyamide.\nd_itis made from amino acid monomers.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nPoly(ethylene terephthalate), or PET, is a condensation polymer, specifically a polyester. Condensation polymers are formed through reactions where monomers join together and a small molecule, such as water, is eliminated for each bond formed. The ester linkages (-COO-) created in PET can be broken down by hydrolysis, which is a chemical reaction with water, often catalysed by an acid or base. This process, known as depolymerisation, reverses the polymerisation reaction and regenerates the original monomers: ethane-1,2-diol and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. These recovered monomers can then be purified and used to synthesise new PET through re-polymerisation. This is a form of chemical recycling.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. It is an addition polymer.**\nThis statement is incorrect. PET is a condensation polymer. Addition polymerisation involves the joining of unsaturated monomers (typically alkenes) by breaking a double bond to form a long saturated chain.

In this case, a hydrogen atom from a propane molecule (C\u2083H\u2088) is substituted by a chlorine atom. The displaced hydrogen atom then combines with the second chlorine atom from the Cl\u2082 molecule to form hydrogen chloride (HCl) as a byproduct. The overall equation for the primary reaction is:\n    C\u2083H\u2088 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 C\u2083H\u2087Cl + HCl\n\nSince both statements 1 and 4 are correct, this option is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A (1 and 2):**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Propane is an **alkane**, which is a saturated hydrocarbon (containing only single C-C bonds). Saturated compounds undergo **substitution reactions**. **Addition reactions** are characteristic of unsaturated compounds like alkenes and alkynes, which have C=C double or C\u2261C triple bonds. In an addition reaction, the double or triple bond breaks to allow new atoms to be added to the molecule, resulting in a single product.\n\n**C (2 and 3):**\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 2 and 3 are false.\n*   **Statement 2 is incorrect** as explained above; propane undergoes substitution, not addition.\n*   **Statement 3 is incorrect** because the product shown, CH\u2083CH\u2082Cl, is **chloroethane**. The starting reactant is **propane** (C\u2083H\u2088), which has three carbon atoms. The substitution product would therefore be **chloropropane** (C\u2083H\u2087Cl), either 1-chloropropane (CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082Cl) or 2-chloropropane (CH\u2083CHClCH\u2083), not chloroethane.\n\n**D (3 and 4):**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false. While statement 4 is correct (HCl is a product), statement 3 is incorrect. The product of the reaction between propane (a three-carbon alkane) and chlorine cannot be chloroethane (a two-carbon chloroalkane).

Chromatography is a versatile separation technique that is not limited to coloured substances. Many important biological and chemical compounds, such as amino acids and sugars, are colourless. To analyse these using paper or thin-layer chromatography, their separated spots must be made visible after the chromatogram has been developed. This is achieved by using a **locating agent** (or developing agent). The chromatogram is treated with the locating agent, which reacts specifically with the separated, colourless substances to produce coloured products. For instance, ninhydrin is a common locating agent used to detect amino acids, which appear as purple or pink spots after application and gentle heating.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It is not possible for two different substances to have the same R_f value.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The retention factor (R_f) is determined by a substance's solubility in the mobile phase and its affinity for the stationary phase. While an R_f value is a characteristic property of a substance under a specific set of conditions (i.e., using the same stationary and mobile phases), it is possible for two different substances to have similar properties that result in the same R_f value. Therefore, while R_f values are a useful tool for identification, a match in R_f values is not absolute proof of identity. To confirm the identity of a substance, it is often necessary to run a known sample alongside the unknown on the same chromatogram.\n\n**B. It is only possible to use chromatography on substances which have a colour.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The fundamental principle of chromatography involves separating components based on their differential movement between a stationary phase and a mobile phase, which depends on their physical and chemical properties (like solubility and adsorption), not their colour. Coloured substances are convenient as they are visible during and after separation, but chromatography works equally well for colourless compounds. As explained in the correct option (C), special techniques like using locating agents are employed to visualise the separated colourless components.\n\n**D. The R_f value of a substance = the distance travelled by the solvent / the distance travelled by the substance**\nThis statement presents an incorrect formula for the retention factor (R_f). The R_f value is defined as the ratio of the distance travelled by the substance to the distance travelled by the solvent front, both measured from the origin line.\n\nThe correct formula is:\n**R_f = distance travelled by the substance / distance travelled by the solvent front**\n\nSince the substance is carried along by the solvent, it cannot travel further than the solvent itself. This means the R_f value is always a value between 0 and 1. The formula given in the option is the reciprocal of the correct formula and would yield a value greater than or equal to 1, which is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_161.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "1. which gas has the slowest rate of diffusion?\na h, b nh, c ch, d co,", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe rate of diffusion of a gas is determined by its relative molecular mass (Mr). According to Graham's Law of Diffusion, lighter gas particles (with a lower Mr) move and diffuse more quickly than heavier gas particles (with a higher Mr). To find the gas with the slowest rate of diffusion, we must identify the gas with the highest relative molecular mass.\n\nThe relative molecular mass of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is calculated as:\nMr(CO\u2082) = Ar(C) + 2 \u00d7 Ar(O) = 12 + (2 \u00d7 16) = 44.\n\nComparing this to the other gases:\n*   H\u2082: Mr = 2\n*   NH\u2083: Mr = 17\n*   CH\u2084: Mr = 16\n\nSince carbon dioxide has the highest relative molecular mass (44), its particles will move the most slowly, and therefore, it will have the slowest rate of diffusion among the given options.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: H\u2082**\nThe rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the relative molecular mass of the gas. Hydrogen (H\u2082) has a relative molecular mass of 2 (2 \u00d7 1). This is the lowest Mr of all the options provided. Consequently, hydrogen is the lightest gas and will have the *fastest* rate of diffusion, not the slowest.\n\n**B: NH\u2083**\nThe relative molecular mass of ammonia (NH\u2083) is 17 (14 + 3 \u00d7 1). While this is heavier than hydrogen and methane, it is significantly lighter than carbon dioxide (Mr = 44). Because its particles are lighter than carbon dioxide particles, ammonia will diffuse more quickly than carbon dioxide, meaning it does not have the slowest rate of diffusion.\n\n**C: CH\u2084**\nThe relative molecular mass of methane (CH\u2084) is 16 (12 + 4 \u00d7 1). This value is lower than that of both ammonia (Mr = 17) and carbon dioxide (Mr = 44). As a result, methane will diffuse faster than both of these gases.

Elements are arranged in vertical columns called groups. A key principle of the Periodic Table is that elements within the same group possess the same number of electrons in their outermost shell, known as valence electrons. The number of valence electrons is the primary determinant of an element's chemical behaviour, including its reactivity and the types of chemical bonds it will form. For instance, all elements in Group 1 (the alkali metals) have one valence electron, making them highly reactive metals that tend to lose one electron to form a +1 ion. Similarly, all elements in Group 17 (the halogens) have seven valence electrons and tend to gain one electron to form a -1 ion, resulting in similar chemical properties within that group.\n\n**Statement 4: Elements in the same group have the same number of outer shell electrons.**\nThis statement is also correct. As described above, the defining characteristic of a group in the Periodic Table is that all its member elements share the same number of valence (outer shell) electrons. For the main group elements (Groups 1, 2, and 13-18), the group number itself often indicates the number of valence electrons. This commonality in electron configuration is the fundamental reason for the similar chemical properties observed among elements in the same group.\n\nSince both statements 1 and 4 are correct, this option is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 1 and 3**\nWhile statement 1 is correct, statement 3 is incorrect. Statement 3 claims that elements in the same group have the same number of electron shells. In fact, as one moves down a group, the number of electron shells increases. Each successive element in a group belongs to the next period, and the period number corresponds to the number of occupied principal energy levels (electron shells). For example, in Group 1, lithium (Period 2) has two electron shells, while sodium (Period 3) has three.\n\n**C: 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.\n*   **Statement 2:** \"Elements in the same period have similar chemical properties\" is incorrect. A period is a horizontal row in the Periodic Table. Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells, but the number of valence electrons increases sequentially across the period. This leads to a wide variation in chemical properties, from reactive metals on the left (e.g., sodium) to non-metals and finally an unreactive noble gas on the right (e.g., argon).\n*   **Statement 3:** \"Elements in the same group have the same number of electron shells\" is incorrect. As explained for option A, the number of electron shells increases as you descend a group.\n\n**D: 2 and 4**\nWhile statement 4 is correct, statement 2 is incorrect. As explained for option C, elements across the same period exhibit a trend of changing chemical properties, not similar ones, because their number of valence electrons differs.

The chemical properties of an atom are determined by its electronic configuration, specifically the number of electrons in its outermost shell (valence electrons). Since isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, their neutral atoms have the same number of electrons. Consequently, they share the same electronic configuration and the same number of valence electrons, causing them to exhibit identical chemical behaviour in reactions.\n\n**Statement 4: Isotopes of the same element have the same electronic configuration.**\nThis statement is also correct. The electronic configuration of an atom is dictated by the number of electrons it possesses. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons (the atomic number). By definition, all isotopes of a particular element have the same number of protons. Therefore, they must also have the same number of electrons, which results in an identical arrangement of these electrons in shells and subshells, i.e., the same electronic configuration.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**Option A (1 and 2):** This option is incorrect because statement 1 is false.\n*   **Statement 1: Isotopes are atoms of different elements with the same number of protons.** This is fundamentally incorrect. The identity of an element is defined by its number of protons. Atoms with the same number of protons belong to the *same* element, not different elements. Isotopes are, by definition, atoms of the same element.\n\n**Option B (1 and 3):** This option is incorrect because both statements 1 and 3 are false.\n*   **Statement 1:** As explained above, this statement incorrectly defines isotopes as being of different elements.\n*   **Statement 3: Isotopes are atoms with the same relative atomic mass.** This is incorrect. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but *different* numbers of neutrons. The mass number (and thus the relative atomic mass of an individual isotope) is the sum of protons and neutrons. Since the neutron count differs, the mass of each isotope is different. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon, but they have different relative atomic masses (approximately 12 and 14, respectively).\n\n**Option D (3 and 4):** This option is incorrect because statement 3 is false.\n*   **Statement 3:** As explained above, isotopes have different numbers of neutrons and therefore different relative atomic masses."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_164.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "4 which diagram shows the arrangement of the outer shell electrons in a molecule of water?\na b\ncc d", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: C\n\nA molecule of water (H\u2082O) is formed through covalent bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. To determine the correct arrangement of outer shell electrons, we must consider the electronic configuration of each atom.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** An oxygen atom has an atomic number of 8, with an electron configuration of 2,6. This means it has 6 electrons in its outer shell (valence electrons). To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full octet of 8 electrons), it needs to gain or share 2 more electrons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A hydrogen atom has an atomic number of 1, with 1 electron in its first and only shell. To achieve a stable configuration (a full duplet of 2 electrons), it needs to gain or share 1 more electron.\n\nIn a water molecule, the oxygen atom forms a single covalent bond with each of the two hydrogen atoms.\n1.  The oxygen atom shares one of its six valence electrons with one hydrogen atom, and that hydrogen atom shares its single electron with the oxygen atom. This forms one bonding pair of electrons.\n2.  The oxygen atom then shares a second valence electron with the other hydrogen atom, which in turn shares its single electron. This forms a second bonding pair of electrons.\n\nAfter bonding, each hydrogen atom has a share in two electrons, completing its outer shell. The oxygen atom has a share in four electrons from the two bonds, plus its remaining four valence electrons, which are not involved in bonding and exist as two non-bonding pairs (lone pairs). This gives the oxygen atom a total of eight electrons in its outer shell, satisfying the octet rule.\n\nDiagram C correctly illustrates this arrangement. It shows two hydrogen atoms, each sharing a pair of electrons with the oxygen atom. It also correctly shows the four non-bonding electrons on the oxygen atom, grouped into two lone pairs.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** This diagram is incorrect because it only shows two valence electrons for the oxygen atom. An oxygen atom has six valence electrons. As a result, the oxygen atom in this diagram only has a total of four electrons in its outer shell (two shared pairs) and does not satisfy the octet rule.\n\n**B:** This diagram is incorrect because it shows each hydrogen atom with an additional, non-bonding electron. A hydrogen atom has only one electron, which it contributes to the covalent bond. It does not have any lone pair electrons. Therefore, showing three electrons associated with each hydrogen atom (one shared pair and one lone electron) is chemically inaccurate.\n\n**D:** This diagram is incorrect because it omits the non-bonding electrons (lone pairs) on the oxygen atom. Although the two covalent bonds are represented, an oxygen atom has six valence electrons. After forming two bonds using two electrons, its remaining four valence electrons must be accounted for. These exist as two lone pairs, which are essential for completing the oxygen atom's octet.

The empirical formula for compound P (glucose) is indeed CH\u2082O. However, the description of the stoichiometric coefficients is incorrect.

We know the concentration and volume of the aqueous alkali. Using the formula:\n\n`moles = concentration \u00d7 volume`\n\nwe can calculate the number of moles of the alkali present.\n\nThe question asks for the number of moles of acid needed to neutralise this specific amount of alkali. The relationship between the number of moles of acid and the number of moles of alkali in a neutralisation reaction is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction. This stoichiometric relationship, or mole ratio, is given by the balanced chemical equation.\n\nFor example:\n*   `HCl + NaOH \u2192 NaCl + H\u2082O` (1 mole of acid reacts with 1 mole of alkali)\n*   `H\u2082SO\u2084 + 2NaOH \u2192 Na\u2082SO\u2084 + 2H\u2082O` (1 mole of acid reacts with 2 moles of alkali)\n\nWithout the balanced chemical equation, it is impossible to know the exact mole ratio between the acid and the alkali. Therefore, the balanced equation for the acid-alkali reaction is the essential additional information required to convert the calculated moles of alkali into the required moles of acid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the concentration of the acid**\nThe concentration of the acid is not needed to calculate the *number of moles* of acid required for neutralisation. This information would be necessary if the goal were to calculate the *volume* of the acid needed, after the number of moles had already been determined.\n\n**C: the formula of the acid**\nWhile knowing the formula of the acid (e.g., HCl or H\u2082SO\u2084) is a step towards determining the balanced equation, it is insufficient on its own. One would also need the formula of the alkali (e.g., NaOH or Ca(OH)\u2082) to write the full balanced equation. The complete balanced equation (Option B) is the direct source of the mole ratio needed for the calculation.\n\n**D: the volume of the acid required for neutralisation**\nThe volume of the acid required for neutralisation is a value that would be measured during an experiment (like a titration) or calculated from the moles and concentration of the acid.

The power source has a negative terminal and a positive terminal. The negative terminal is connected to the cathode, and the positive terminal is connected to the anode. The power source pumps electrons from its negative terminal through the external circuit (the wires) to the cathode. Consequently, the cathode becomes negatively charged. At the cathode, reduction occurs, where positive ions (cations) from the electrolyte gain these electrons. Therefore, the statement that electrons move in the external circuit towards the cathode is correct.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. Electrons move through the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The flow of charge within the electrolyte is facilitated by the movement of mobile ions, not free electrons. Positive ions (cations) move towards the cathode, and negative ions (anions) move towards theanode. Electrons do not travel through the electrolyte solution or molten electrolyte.\n\n**C. Negative ions move in the external circuit towards the anode.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The external circuit consists of metallic wires.

It attracts positively charged ions (cations). In this case, both Cu\u00b2\u207a and H\u207a ions are attracted to the cathode.\n\nAt the cathode, reduction occurs, which is the gain of electrons. There is a competition between the Cu\u00b2\u207a and H\u207a ions to be reduced. The outcome is determined by their relative positions in the electrochemical series. Ions of less reactive metals are reduced more easily than ions of more reactive metals. Since copper is less reactive than hydrogen, copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) are more readily reduced than hydrogen ions (H\u207a).\n\nTherefore, at the cathode, each copper(II) ion gains two electrons to form a neutral copper atom, which deposits as a solid layer on the cathode. The half-equation for this reduction reaction is:\n**Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu**\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. 2H\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 H\u2082**\nThis half-equation represents the reduction of hydrogen ions to form hydrogen gas. While hydrogen ions are present in the aqueous solution and are attracted to the cathode, they are not preferentially discharged. Copper is less reactive than hydrogen, meaning Cu\u00b2\u207a ions are easier to reduce than H\u207a ions. Therefore, copper is formed at the cathode instead of hydrogen gas.\n\n**B. 4OH\u207b \u2192 O\u2082 + 2H\u2082O + 4e\u207b**\nThis half-equation represents the oxidation of hydroxide ions, which is a process that occurs at the positive electrode (anode), not the negative electrode (cathode). Furthermore, this reaction typically occurs when using inert electrodes (like platinum or graphite). In this specific setup with an active copper anode, the anode itself would oxidise in preference to the hydroxide ions.\n\n**C. Cu \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b**\nThis half-equation shows the oxidation of copper atoms into copper(II) ions through the loss of electrons. Oxidation occurs at the anode (the positive electrode), not the cathode. This reaction correctly describes what happens at the active copper anode, where the electrode dissolves into the solution.

According to collision theory, for a chemical reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with each other. However, not all collisions result in a reaction. For a collision to be successful (or effective), two conditions must be met:\n    1.  The particles must collide with the correct orientation.\n    2.  The colliding particles must possess a minimum amount of kinetic energy.\n    This minimum energy is known as the activation energy (Ea). It is the energy required to break the existing chemical bonds in the reactants and allow new bonds to form in the products. Therefore, any collision with energy less than Ea will be ineffective and will not lead to a chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Ea is always endothermic.**\n    This statement is also correct. Activation energy represents an energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to start. It is the energy that must be absorbed by the reactant molecules to reach an unstable, high-energy state called the activated complex or transition state. Since this process involves an input or absorption of energy from the surroundings, it is, by definition, an endothermic process. This is true for all chemical reactions, regardless of whether the overall reaction releases energy (exothermic) or absorbs energy (endothermic).\n\n### **Explanation of Incorrect Statements**\n\n*   **Statement 2: Ea for exothermic reactions is always greater than for endothermic reactions.**\n    This statement is incorrect. There is no direct correlation that dictates the activation energy of an exothermic reaction must be greater than that of an endothermic reaction.\n    *   An **exothermic reaction** releases energy, meaning the products have lower energy than the reactants. It can have a high or a low activation energy. For example, the combustion of fuel is highly exothermic but requires a high activation energy (a spark or flame) to start.\n    *   An **endothermic reaction** absorbs energy, meaning the products have higher energy than the reactants. It can also have a high or a low activation energy.\n    The magnitude of the activation energy depends on the specific chemical bonds being broken and formed, not on the overall enthalpy change (\u0394H) of the reaction.\n\n### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect**\n\n*   **Option A (1, 2 and 3)** is incorrect because statement 2 is false.\n*   **Option B (1 and 2 only)** is incorrect because statement 2 is false.\n*   **Option D (2 and 3 only)** is incorrect because statement 2 is false."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_173.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "13 astudent adds excess magnesium ribbon to 10cm\u2019 of 0.5 mol/dm* sulfuric acid.\nthe hydrogen gas produced is collected and its total volume is measured every 10 seconds.\nthe experiment is repeated with 5m? of 0.5mol/dm? sulfuric acid added to 5cm\u2019* of water using\nthe same mass of magnesium ribbon.\n\nwhich line on the graph shows the results of the second experiment?\n250-7 eee\nker hh a a hh]\na | a a\n[tpt pp yt? tert rrr rr rt pr\n200 eee eea\nlet i pari i ha ha ph po pa ea\na oa 0 a a gr gp (a fa\ndnt? je sae\nht are epee\n1509-7 7 eee ongina\u2019 experimen 4\ntotal volume of eere ere eee eee\nhydrogen /cm? cop es\n400 (wj a a eee\nh/o + rar\n| taiz tero a a ci\na i a ee\nae a a\n50-4 ev tp pp\n[27 2\u00b0 es\nka a a | a\nef 0/29 a a ga (a f(a\nfs a a a a a a i\n(oy 2\n0 50 100 150 200 250\ntime/s", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe second experiment involves two key changes compared to the original experiment: a change in the amount of the limiting reactant and a change in its concentration.\n\n1.  **Total Volume of Hydrogen Produced:** The reaction is:\n    Mg(s) + H\u2082SO\u2084(aq) \u2192 MgSO\u2084(aq) + H\u2082(g)\n    Magnesium is in excess, so sulfuric acid is the limiting reactant. The amount of hydrogen gas produced is directly proportional to the moles of sulfuric acid used.\n    *   **Original experiment:** Moles of H\u2082SO\u2084 = 0.5 mol/dm\u00b3 \u00d7 (10/1000) dm\u00b3 = 0.005 mol.\n    *   **Second experiment:** Moles of H\u2082SO\u2084 = 0.5 mol/dm\u00b3 \u00d7 (5/1000) dm\u00b3 = 0.0025 mol.\n    Since the second experiment uses half the moles of sulfuric acid, it will produce half the total volume of hydrogen gas. The original experiment produced 120 cm\u00b3 of H\u2082, so the second experiment will produce 120 cm\u00b3 / 2 = 60 cm\u00b3 of H\u2082.\n\n2.  **Rate of Reaction:** The rate of reaction is affected by the concentration of the reactants.\n    *   **Original experiment:** Concentration of H\u2082SO\u2084 = 0.5 mol/dm\u00b3.\n    *   **Second experiment:** 5 cm\u00b3 of acid is diluted with 5 cm\u00b3 of water, making the total volume 10 cm\u00b3. The number of moles of acid remains 0.0025 mol. The new concentration is Moles / Volume = 0.0025 mol / (10/1000) dm\u00b3 = 0.25 mol/dm\u00b3.\n    Since the concentration of sulfuric acid is halved, the frequency of successful collisions between the reactant particles decreases, resulting in a slower rate of reaction.\n\nOn the graph, the rate of reaction is represented by the gradient (steepness) of the curve, and the total volume of gas is the final, constant volume where the curve becomes horizontal. Curve D shows both a slower rate (a less steep gradient than the original experiment) and a final volume of 60 cm\u00b3.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A:** This curve shows a much faster reaction rate (steeper gradient) and produces double the volume of hydrogen gas (240 cm\u00b3). This would correspond to an experiment with a higher concentration of acid and double the initial moles of acid, which is the opposite of the changes made.\n*   **B:** This curve shows a faster reaction rate (steeper gradient) but produces the same total volume of hydrogen (120 cm\u00b3). A faster rate would require a higher concentration or temperature, and the same final volume would require the same number of moles of sulfuric acid. Neither of these conditions matches the second experiment.\n*   **C:** This curve shows a slower reaction rate (less steep gradient), which is consistent with the lower concentration of the acid. However, it shows the same final volume of hydrogen (120 cm\u00b3).

To achieve the greatest yield of ethanol, the equilibrium must be shifted as far as possible to the right (the product side).\n\n**Effect of Pressure:**\nThe equation is: C\u2082H\u2084(g) + H\u2082O(g) \u21cc C\u2082H\u2085OH(g)\nThere are 2 moles of gaseous reactants (1 mole of ethene + 1 mole of steam) and 1 mole of gaseous product (ethanol). According to Le Chatelier's principle, an increase in pressure will cause the equilibrium to shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. Therefore, a **high pressure** is required to favour the forward reaction and increase the yield of ethanol.\n\n**Effect of Temperature:**\nThe forward reaction is exothermic, as indicated by \u0394H being negative. This means the reaction releases heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, a decrease in temperature will cause the equilibrium to shift in the exothermic direction to produce more heat. Therefore, a **low temperature** is required to favour the forward reaction and increase the yield of ethanol.\n\nCombining these two conditions, a high pressure and a low temperature will produce the greatest yield of ethanol.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: low pressure, low temperature**\nWhile a low temperature correctly favours the exothermic forward reaction, a low pressure is incorrect. A low pressure would cause the equilibrium to shift to the left, towards the side with more moles of gas (the reactants), thereby decreasing the yield of ethanol.\n\n**B: low pressure, high temperature**\nBoth conditions are incorrect for maximizing yield. A low pressure would shift the equilibrium to the left (reactants side). A high temperature would also shift the equilibrium to the left, as it favours the endothermic (reverse) reaction. Both factors would significantly decrease the yield of ethanol.\n\n**D: high pressure, high temperature**\nWhile a high pressure correctly favours the forward reaction, a high temperature is incorrect. A high temperature would cause the equilibrium to shift in the endothermic direction, which is the reverse reaction. This would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the yield of ethanol.

However, in practice, a very high yield (around 98%) is achieved at a relatively low pressure of **1-2 atmospheres (atm)**. Using high pressures would be unnecessarily expensive in terms of both building and running the plant for only a very small increase in yield. Therefore, a low pressure of approximately 2 atm and a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst are the optimal economic conditions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nWhile the pressure of 2 atm is correct for the Contact process, the catalyst identified is incorrect. The catalyst used for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide is vanadium(V) oxide (V\u2082O\u2085). Iron is the catalyst used in a different industrial process, the Haber process, for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nBoth the pressure and the catalyst identified are incorrect for this stage of the Contact process. A high pressure of 200 atm is not used because the reaction already provides a high yield at a much lower, more economical pressure of around 2 atm. The catalyst used is vanadium(V) oxide (V\u2082O\u2085), not iron. The conditions of 200 atm pressure and an iron catalyst are characteristic of the Haber process for producing ammonia.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nWhile the catalyst, vanadium(V) oxide, is correct for the Contact process, the pressure is incorrect.

It exhibits a distinct colour change over a specific pH range. In acidic and neutral solutions (with a pH below 9.3), thymolphthalein is colourless. In alkaline (basic) solutions (with a pH above 10.5), it turns blue. Dilute hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, which means it produces a solution with a very low pH (typically pH 1-2). Since this pH is well within the acidic range for the indicator, thymolphthalein will be in its colourless form.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) blue:**\nThe colour blue is characteristic of thymolphthalein only in strongly alkaline (basic) conditions, specifically at a pH greater than 10.5.

A higher concentration of H\u207a ions leads to more frequent successful collisions with the magnesium atoms, resulting in a faster reaction and a quicker production of hydrogen gas.\n\nThe question states that acid P and acid Q have the same molar concentration but acid P reacts faster. This indicates that for the same molar concentration, acid P provides a higher concentration of H\u207a ions in solution than acid Q. This is the key difference between a strong and a weak acid.\n\n*   **Acid P is a strong acid:** It is fully dissociated (or ionised) in water, meaning all its molecules release their hydrogen ions. This results in a high concentration of H\u207a ions and a fast reaction.\n*   **Acid Q is a weak acid:** It is only partially dissociated in water. This means that at any given moment, only a small fraction of its molecules have released their hydrogen ions, resulting in a lower concentration of H\u207a ions and a slower reaction.\n\nThe total volume of hydrogen gas produced depends on the total number of moles of acid molecules available to react (assuming the acid is the limiting reactant, or that there is enough of both acids to react with all the magnesium). Since both acids have the same concentration and volume, they contain the same total number of moles of acid molecules. Although the weak acid (Q) releases its H\u207a ions slowly, as they are consumed in the reaction, the equilibrium of its dissociation shifts to release more H\u207a ions (Le Chatelier's Principle). Eventually, all the acid molecules will react, producing the same total amount of hydrogen gas as the strong acid (P).\n\nTherefore, the observation that acid P reacts faster than acid Q, but both produce the same total volume of hydrogen gas, is correctly explained by acid P being a strong (fully dissociated) acid and acid Q being a weak (partially dissociated) acid.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Acid P has a higher pH than acid Q.**\n\nThis is incorrect. pH is a measure of the acidity of a solution, defined as pH = -log[H\u207a]. This means that a higher concentration of hydrogen ions ([H\u207a]) results in a lower pH value. Since acid P reacts faster, it must have a higher concentration of H\u207a ions than acid Q. Consequently, acid P has a lower pH than acid Q.\n\n**B. Acid P has a lower concentration of hydrogen ions.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The rate of this reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions. The problem states that acid P reacts much faster than acid Q. A faster reaction rate implies a higher concentration of reactants, which in this case are the hydrogen ions. Therefore, acid P must have a higher concentration of hydrogen ions than acid Q.\n\n**D. Acid Q is a proton acceptor.**\n\nThis is incorrect. According to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, an acid is defined as a proton (H\u207a ion) donor. A substance that accepts protons is a base. The question explicitly states that Q is an acid, so it must be a proton donor, not a proton acceptor."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_180.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "20 which process is not used in the preparation of an insoluble salt?\na filtration\nb~ washing\nc crystallisation\nd_ drying", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**C. crystallisation:** Crystallisation is a separation technique used to obtain a pure solid substance from its saturated solution. This process is applicable only to **soluble** salts. Since the salt in question is **insoluble**, it does not dissolve in the solvent to form a solution. Instead, it is formed as a solid precipitate through a precipitation reaction. Therefore, crystallisation is not a step in the preparation of an insoluble salt.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. filtration:** Filtration is a laboratory process used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. In the preparation of an insoluble salt via precipitation, the salt is formed as a solid suspended in a liquid mixture.

Potassium is in Period 4, located below lithium, which is in Period 2. The physical properties of Group I metals follow predictable trends as you descend the group.\n\n*   **Melting Point:** The melting point of metals is determined by the strength of their metallic bonds. Metallic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of positive metal ions and a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. As you go down Group I, the atoms get larger because more electron shells are added. This increases the distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised valence electron. The attraction becomes weaker, resulting in weaker metallic bonds. Less energy is required to overcome these weaker bonds, so the melting point decreases down the group. Therefore, potassium has a lower melting point than lithium (less than 181 \u00b0C).\n\n*   **Density:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume (d = m/v). As you descend Group I, both the atomic mass and the atomic radius (and thus atomic volume) increase. However, the increase in atomic mass is more significant than the increase in atomic volume. This leads to a general increase in density down the group. Therefore, potassium is denser than lithium (greater than 0.53 g/cm\u00b3).\n\nCombining these two trends, potassium has a melting point less than 181 \u00b0C and a density greater than 0.53 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because while it correctly states that the melting point of potassium is less than that of lithium, it incorrectly states that its density is also lower. Density generally increases down Group I as the increase in atomic mass is greater than the increase in atomic volume.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it gets both trends wrong. The melting point of alkali metals decreases down the group due to weakening metallic bonds, so potassium's melting point is lower, not greater, than lithium's. The density increases down the group, so potassium's density is greater, not less, than lithium's.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that the density of potassium is greater than that of lithium, it incorrectly states that the melting point is also greater.

The electrons in the outermost s-orbital and the inner d-orbital have very similar energy levels. Consequently, different numbers of electrons can be lost from these orbitals during chemical reactions, leading to the formation of ions with different charges (oxidation states). For example, iron can exist as Fe\u00b2\u207a (iron(II)) and Fe\u00b3\u207a (iron(III)), and copper can exist as Cu\u207a (copper(I)) and Cu\u00b2\u207a (copper(II)).\n\n*   **Statement 3: They have a high melting point.** This is a correct statement for most transition elements. Transition metals possess strong metallic bonding. This is because the delocalised electrons that hold the metal lattice together come from both the outer s-orbitals and the inner d-orbitals. The strong electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the large sea of delocalised electrons requires a significant amount of thermal energy to overcome, resulting in high melting and boiling points.\n\n*   **Statement 1: They have a low density.** This statement is incorrect. Transition elements are generally dense. Compared to alkali metals (Group 1) in the same period, which are known for their low densities, transition metals have a greater nuclear charge and more electrons packed into a similar volume, leading to higher densities. For instance, iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm\u00b3, whereas sodium has a density of only 0.97 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n*   **Statement 4: They form only colourless compounds.** This statement is incorrect. The formation of coloured compounds is one of the most distinctive properties of transition elements. The colour arises because their ions often have partially filled d-orbitals. Electrons can be excited from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital by absorbing specific frequencies of visible light. The colour observed is the complementary colour of the light that is absorbed. For example, hydrated copper(II) compounds are blue, and potassium manganate(VII) is purple.

This structure consists of a regular, repeating arrangement of positive metal ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised, mobile electrons.\n\n1.  **Good heat conductivity:** This is a characteristic property of all metals. When a metal is heated, the delocalised electrons gain kinetic energy and move rapidly throughout the lattice, colliding with metal ions and other electrons, efficiently transferring thermal energy from one part of the metal to another.\n\n3.  **Malleability:** This is the ability of a material to be hammered or rolled into different shapes without breaking. In a metallic lattice, when a force is applied, the layers of positive ions can slide over one another. The delocalised electrons are free to move and maintain the electrostatic attraction (metallic bond) between the layers in their new positions. This prevents the lattice from shattering, making metals malleable.\n\nSince both good heat conductivity and malleability are consequences of the metallic bond and structure, they are considered typical properties of all metals.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 1 and 2**\n\nThis option is incorrect because not all metals have a low density. While some metals, such as the alkali metals (e.g., lithium and sodium), have low densities and can float on water, many others, particularly the transition metals (e.g., iron, lead, and gold), are very dense. Therefore, low density is not a typical property of *all* metals.\n\n**C. 2 and 3**\n\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as option A. The statement that all metals have low density is factually incorrect. Density is a variable property among metals, with a wide range from very low (e.g., lithium at 0.53 g/cm\u00b3) to very high (e.g., osmium at 22.59 g/cm\u00b3). Thus, low density cannot be considered a general property of all metals.\n\n**D. 3 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it is incomplete. While malleability (property 3) is a typical physical property of metals, so is good heat conductivity (property 1). The 'sea' of delocalised electrons that allows for malleability is also responsible for the efficient transfer of heat.

Every member of the alkane series, such as methane (CH4, n=1), ethane (C2H6, n=2), and propane (C3H8, n=3), conforms to this general formula.

The product is an alcohol. The number of possible alcohol isomers formed depends on whether the starting alkene is symmetrical or asymmetrical.\n\n*   **Ethene + steam:**\n    Ethene (CH\u2082=CH\u2082) is a symmetrical alkene because the atoms and groups attached to each carbon of the double bond are identical.

Due to this asymmetry, the -OH group can add to either of the two carbon atoms of the original double bond, resulting in two different structural isomers.\n\n    1.

Fermentation uses carbohydrates, such as glucose from crops like sugarcane or corn, as the starting material. These are considered renewable resources because the crops can be replanted and harvested, providing a sustainable source. In contrast, the addition of steam to ethene (hydration of ethene) relies on ethene produced from the cracking of hydrocarbons found in crude oil. Crude oil is a fossil fuel, which is a finite, non-renewable resource.

To obtain pure ethanol, this dilute solution must be purified through fractional distillation, which is an additional, energy-intensive step. The hydration of ethene, however, produces a much purer ethanol product.\n\n**C. Fermentation is a fast process.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Fermentation is a relatively slow biochemical process that occurs in batches and can take several days to complete. In contrast, the hydration of ethene is a continuous industrial process that occurs at a much faster rate, making it more suitable for large-scale, rapid production of ethanol.

In this unit, one backbone carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and the other is bonded to a hydrogen atom and a -CH2CHO group. This is structurally different from the repeating unit observed in the given polymer.\n\n**B:** This structure is 3-methylbut-2-enal ((CH3)2C=CH-CHO). Addition polymerisation of this monomer would yield a repeating unit of -[C(CH3)2-CH(CHO)]-. This unit contains a carbon atom bonded to two methyl groups, which does not match the polymer structure shown, where each corresponding carbon in the repeating unit has only one methyl group.\n\n**D:** This structure is a saturated cyclic compound (a substituted cyclobutane). Addition polymers are formed from unsaturated monomers containing a C=C double bond, not from saturated rings. While cyclic compounds can be involved in other types of reactions or polymerisations (like ring-opening polymerisation), this structure would not form the given linear addition polymer."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_200.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "40 which piece of apparatus is used to measure 24.5 cm? of gas produced during a reaction?\na __ beaker\nb_ conical flask\nc measuring cylinder\nd_ volumetric pipette", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA measuring cylinder is used to measure variable volumes of liquids or, in this case, gases. To measure the volume of gas produced during a reaction, a measuring cylinder can be filled with water and inverted in a trough of water.

Therefore, liquid sodium chloride at 900 \u00b0C consists of particles that are randomly arranged and move randomly.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option describes the properties of a substance in the solid state. In a solid, particles are held in fixed positions within a highly ordered, regular structure (a crystal lattice). Their motion is restricted to vibrations about these fixed points.

This is known as Graham's Law of Diffusion. In simpler terms, lighter gases (with a lower Mr) diffuse faster and travel further in a given time than heavier gases (with a higher Mr).\n\nTo determine where the two gases meet, we must compare their relative molecular masses:\n*   **Hydrogen bromide (HBr):** Mr = Ar(H) + Ar(Br) = 1 + 80 = 81\n*   **Ammonia (NH\u2083):** Mr = Ar(N) + 3 \u00d7 Ar(H) = 14 + (3 \u00d7 1) = 17\n\nSince hydrogen bromide (Mr = 81) is much heavier than ammonia (Mr = 17), the ammonia gas will diffuse much more rapidly along the tube than the hydrogen bromide gas. Consequently, the ammonia molecules will travel a significantly greater distance from their source before they meet the slower-moving hydrogen bromide molecules. The white cloud of solid ammonium bromide (NH\u2084Br) will therefore form at a point very close to the source of the heavier, slower-diffusing hydrogen bromide gas, which corresponds to position A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nPosition B is further from the source of hydrogen bromide than position A. While the gases meet away from the HBr source, position B does not accurately reflect the large difference in the diffusion rates. The relative molecular mass of HBr (81) is almost five times greater than that of NH\u2083 (17). This significant difference in mass means HBr diffuses much more slowly, and the meeting point will be very close to its source. Position B would be more likely if the mass of the hydrogen halide were closer to that of ammonia.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nPosition C is located in the centre of the tube. A reaction would only occur in the middle of the apparatus if the two reacting gases had similar relative molecular masses and therefore diffused at approximately the same rate. As calculated, the relative molecular mass of HBr (81) is very different from that of NH\u2083 (17). Therefore, their diffusion rates are vastly different, and the meeting point cannot be in the centre.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nPosition D is located near the source of ammonia gas. For the white solid to form at this position, the hydrogen bromide gas would have to diffuse much faster than the ammonia gas. This would only be possible if HBr were significantly lighter than NH\u2083. However, the opposite is true; HBr (Mr = 81) is much heavier than NH\u2083 (Mr = 17) and thus diffuses much more slowly.

The correct volume is 6.0 dm\u00b3, which is equivalent to 6000 cm\u00b3 (since 1 dm\u00b3 = 1000 cm\u00b3). The value 96.0 cm\u00b3 is significantly different. A possible calculation error leading to the number 96 would be to incorrectly multiply the molar volume (24 dm\u00b3) by the number of carbon atoms (4), yielding 96 dm\u00b3. The units in this option (cm\u00b3) are also incorrect for that flawed calculation.\n\n**B: 6.0 cm\u00b3**\nThis option has the correct numerical value but incorrect units. The calculation yields a volume of 6.0 dm\u00b3. It is crucial to distinguish between cubic decimetres (dm\u00b3) and cubic centimetres (cm\u00b3). One cubic decimetre is equal to 1000 cubic centimetres. Therefore, 6.0 dm\u00b3 is equal to 6000 cm\u00b3, not 6.0 cm\u00b3. This answer is incorrect by a factor of 1000.\n\n**C: 96.0 dm\u00b3**\nThis answer is incorrect and likely arises from a conceptual error. This value may have been obtained by multiplying the molar volume of a gas at RTP (24 dm\u00b3/mol) by the number of carbon atoms in a butane molecule (4), i.e., 4 \u00d7 24 dm\u00b3/mol = 96 dm\u00b3.

The anode is the electrode connected to the positive terminal, and the cathode is connected to the negative terminal. Oxidation, the loss of electrons, occurs at the anode. Reduction, the gain of electrons, occurs at the cathode.\n\nFor the overall circuit to be complete, electrons released during oxidation at the anode must be transported to the cathode where they are consumed in reduction. This transport occurs through the external circuit. Therefore, electrons flow from the anode (the positive electrode), through the connecting wire to the positive terminal of the power supply. The power supply then pushes the electrons from its negative terminal, through the other wire, to the cathode (the negative electrode). Consequently, the net movement of electrons in the external circuit is from the positive electrode (anode) to the negative electrode (cathode).\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: Copper atoms gain electrons at the cathode and copper(II) ions lose electrons at the anode.**\n    This statement is incorrect because it reverses the processes and misidentifies the reacting species. At the cathode (negative electrode), positively charged copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a), not neutral copper atoms, are attracted and gain electrons in a reduction reaction.

Copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) are cations, meaning they carry a positive charge. In electrolysis, charged ions move towards the electrode of the opposite charge. Therefore, the positively charged copper(II) ions move through the electrolyte *towards* the negatively charged cathode, not away from it.\n\n*   **D: Copper is formed at the cathode and oxygen is formed at the anode.**\n    This statement is partially correct but ultimately wrong. While it is true that copper is formed at the cathode (Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s)), the product at the anode is incorrect for this specific setup. The anode is made of copper, which is an 'active' electrode. It is easier to oxidise the copper metal of the anode than to oxidise the hydroxide or sulfate ions from the aqueous solution. As a result, the copper anode itself dissolves, forming copper(II) ions (Cu(s) \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b).

As the potassium bromide solution is concentrated, bromide ions are oxidised to form bromine.\n*   **Anode reaction:** 2Br\u207b(aq) \u2192 Br\u2082(l) + 2e\u207b\n\nTherefore, bromine is formed at the anode and hydrogen is formed at the cathode.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies bromine as the product at the anode but incorrectly identifies potassium as the product at the cathode. At the cathode, both potassium ions (K\u207a) and hydrogen ions (H\u207a) are present and attracted to the negative electrode. According to the reactivity series, the less reactive cation is discharged. Potassium is a highly reactive metal, significantly more reactive than hydrogen. Consequently, hydrogen ions will be reduced to form hydrogen gas in preference to potassium ions being reduced to form potassium metal.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly assigns the products to the electrodes. In electrolysis, anions (negatively charged ions) migrate to the anode (positive electrode), and cations (positively charged ions) migrate to the cathode (negative electrode). Bromide ions (Br\u207b) are anions and are therefore oxidised at the anode to form bromine. Hydrogen ions (H\u207a) are cations and are therefore reduced at the cathode to form hydrogen. Hydrogen cannot be formed at the anode, and bromine cannot be formed at the cathode.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it states that hydrogen is formed at the anode. Hydrogen is formed from the reduction of positive hydrogen ions (H\u207a), which occurs at the negative cathode. Secondly, it states that potassium is formed at the cathode. As explained previously, potassium is more reactive than hydrogen, so hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode in an aqueous solution, not potassium metal."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_211.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "11 hydrogen-\u2014oxygen fuel cells and gasoline are each used to power cars.\nwhich statement describes an advantage of using hydrogen\u2014oxygen fuel cells in cars in comparison\nwith gasoline engines?\na_ hydrogen is a non-renewable resource.\nb_ hydrogen is produced during the fractional distillation of petroleum.\nc  hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells do not release carbon dioxide.\nd  hydrogen\u2014oxygen fuel cells need electricity to work.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe primary advantage of using hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells over internal combustion engines that burn gasoline is environmental. A hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen (H\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082). The overall chemical equation for this process is:\n\n2H\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 2H\u2082O(l) + energy\n\nThe only product of this reaction is water (H\u2082O). In contrast, gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons. Its combustion in a car engine produces several harmful by-products, most notably carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), a significant greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

Hydrogen is a non-renewable resource.**\nThis statement is incorrect and would be a disadvantage, not an advantage. While most hydrogen is currently produced from non-renewable natural gas, it can also be produced by the electrolysis of water (H\u2082O). If the electricity for electrolysis is generated from renewable sources like solar or wind power, then hydrogen fuel is considered a renewable resource. Gasoline, derived from petroleum, is definitively a non-renewable resource.\n\n**B. Hydrogen is produced during the fractional distillation of petroleum.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Fractional distillation is a physical process used to separate crude oil into different fractions (like gasoline, kerosene, and diesel) based on their boiling points. It does not produce hydrogen gas. While hydrogen can be produced from hydrocarbons found in petroleum through a separate chemical process called steam reforming, this is not an advantage as it still relies on a non-renewable fossil fuel and produces carbon dioxide.\n\n**D. Hydrogen\u2013oxygen fuel cells need electricity to work.**\nThis statement describes the opposite of what a fuel cell does. A hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is an electrochemical device that *generates* electricity from the chemical energy stored in hydrogen and oxygen.

A physical change alters the form or state of a substance but does not change its chemical identity. In this process, solid water (ice, H\u2082O(s)) absorbs energy and transitions into liquid water (H\u2082O(l)). The molecules are still water (H\u2082O); only their arrangement and energy have changed. Since no new chemical substance is formed, this is a classic example of a physical change, specifically a change of state.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A**\nBurning a piece of magnesium is a chemical change. The term 'burning' refers to combustion, which is a rapid reaction between a substance and an oxidant, usually oxygen, to produce heat and light. In this case, magnesium metal (Mg) reacts with oxygen (O\u2082) from the air to form a new chemical compound, magnesium oxide (MgO). The formation of a new substance with different chemical and physical properties (a white powder from a silvery metal) signifies that a chemical reaction has occurred.\n\n**B**\nReacting calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid is a chemical change. This is an acid-carbonate reaction that produces new substances. Calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082), water (H\u2082O), and carbon dioxide gas (CO\u2082). The production of a gas and the formation of new compounds with entirely different properties from the reactants are clear indicators of a chemical change, not a physical one.\n\n**D**\nThe rusting of an iron nail is a chemical change. Rusting is the common term for the corrosion of iron, which is an oxidation-reduction reaction. Iron (Fe) reacts with oxygen (O\u2082) in the presence of water (H\u2082O) to form a new substance, hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O), commonly known as rust.

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. By lowering this energy barrier, it speeds up the rate at which reactants are converted to products (the forward reaction) and the rate at which products are converted back to reactants (the backward reaction). The catalyst increases both rates equally, which means the position of the equilibrium is not changed, but the time taken to reach equilibrium is significantly reduced.\n\n*   **Statement 3: A low pressure is used to keep the costs low.** This statement is correct. From an industrial perspective, economic factors are crucial. Although high pressure would favour a higher yield of sulfur trioxide (see explanation for statement 2 below), generating and maintaining high pressures requires expensive, reinforced equipment and consumes a large amount of energy. Since the Contact process already achieves a very high percentage yield (around 99.5%) at a relatively low pressure (close to atmospheric pressure), it is more economically viable to use a low pressure and avoid the high costs associated with high-pressure systems.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **Statement 2: A low pressure increases the yield of sulfur trioxide.** This statement is incorrect. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the effect of pressure on a gaseous equilibrium depends on the number of moles of gas on each side of the equation.\n    *   **Reactants:** 2SO\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) = 3 moles of gas\n    *   **Products:** 2SO\u2083(g) = 2 moles of gas\n    An increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles of gas to counteract the change. In this case, a high pressure favours the forward reaction, increasing the yield of sulfur trioxide. Conversely, a low pressure would favour the reverse reaction, decreasing the yield.\n\n*   **Statement 4: A high temperature increases the yield of sulfur trioxide.** This statement is incorrect.

For this reaction, the reverse direction is endothermic. Therefore, a high temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the yield of sulfur trioxide.

A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.

By speeding up both reactions equally, the catalyst allows the system to reach equilibrium faster but does not change the position of the equilibrium.\n\n**B. When equilibrium is reached, the forward reaction has stopped.**\n\n*   **Explanation:** This statement is incorrect. Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic state, not a static one.

According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change in conditions is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift to counteract the change. The forward reaction involves a decrease in the number of moles of gas (from 4 moles of reactants to 2 moles of product).

The chemical equation shows that lead(II) iodide (PbI\u2082(s)) is a solid precipitate, while sodium nitrate (NaNO\u2083(aq)) is an aqueous solution, meaning it is dissolved in water. Filtration is a technique used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. In this process, the mixture is passed through a filter paper. The solid lead(II) iodide, known as the residue, is trapped by the filter paper, while the aqueous solution of sodium nitrate, known as the filtrate, passes through.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) Crystallisation** is incorrect. Crystallisation is a method used to obtain a pure solid from its saturated solution. It involves evaporating the solvent to concentrate the solution, followed by cooling to allow crystals to form. This technique is suitable for separating a *soluble* solid, like sodium nitrate, from its solvent, but not for separating an *insoluble* solid like lead(II) iodide from a liquid mixture.\n\n**B) Distillation** is incorrect. Distillation is a process used to separate components of a liquid mixture based on differences in their boiling points. It is typically used to separate a pure solvent from a solution containing a dissolved solute (simple distillation) or to separate two miscible liquids (fractional distillation). It is not the appropriate method for separating an undissolved solid precipitate from a liquid.\n\n**C) Evaporation** is incorrect. Evaporation is used to separate a dissolved solid (solute) from a liquid solvent by heating the solution to drive off the solvent as vapour. While this would remove the water, it would leave behind a mixture of solid lead(II) iodide and solid sodium nitrate, thus failing to separate the lead(II) iodide from the other product in the mixture."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_222.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "22 which statement explains why sulfur, s, has similar chemical properties to selenium, se?\na_ they both have the same number of electrons in their outer electron shell.\nb_ they are both solids at room temperature and pressure.\nc_ they are both non-metals.\nd_ they both form negative ions.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe chemical properties of an element are primarily determined by its electron configuration, specifically the number of electrons in its outermost shell (valence electrons). Elements located in the same group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons. Both sulfur (S) and selenium (Se) are in Group 16.

Because they have an identical number of valence electrons, they tend to react in similar ways to achieve a stable electron arrangement (a full outer shell), leading to their similar chemical properties.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. They are both solids at room temperature and pressure.**\nThis statement describes a shared *physical property* (state of matter), not a chemical property. While it is true that both sulfur and selenium are solids at standard conditions, this does not explain the basis of their chemical reactivity. Chemical properties relate to how substances change during a chemical reaction, which is governed by electron arrangement, not physical state.\n\n**C. They are both non-metals.**\nThis is a correct classification, but it is too general to be the fundamental explanation. The category of \"non-metals\" includes many elements with very different chemical properties (for example, oxygen, chlorine, and carbon).

The fundamental reason *why* they both tend to form negative ions (specifically, S\u00b2\u207b and Se\u00b2\u207b) is that they both have six valence electrons and need to gain two electrons to achieve a stable, full outer shell.

This identifies them as elements in Group 1 of the periodic table, also known as the alkali metals. The properties of elements in a group follow predictable patterns, or trends.\n\nLet's analyse the trends for Group 1 elements as you move down the group:\n*   **Melting Point and Boiling Point:** These decrease as you go down the group. This is because the atoms get larger, and the strength of the metallic bonding between the atoms decreases.\n*   **Density:** This generally increases as you go down the group. Although the atomic size increases, the atomic mass increases more significantly, leading to a greater mass per unit volume.\n\nThe table shows the order of melting points is: Sodium (98\u00b0C) > Rubidium (39\u00b0C) > Q (28\u00b0C).\nThe table shows the order of density is: Sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3) < Rubidium (1.53 g/cm\u00b3) < Q (1.87 g/cm\u00b3).\n\nBoth trends indicate that element Q is located below rubidium in Group 1. The order of the first few alkali metals in the periodic table is Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Caesium (Cs). The element directly below rubidium is caesium. Therefore, Q is caesium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) hydrogen**\nWhile hydrogen is in Group 1, it is a non-metal and exists as a gas at room temperature. Its melting point (-259\u00b0C) and boiling point (-253\u00b0C) are extremely low and do not match the properties of element Q, which has a melting point of 28\u00b0C.\n\n**B) lithium**\nLithium is a Group 1 alkali metal, but it is located above sodium in the periodic table. According to group trends, lithium should have a higher melting point (180.5\u00b0C) and a lower density (0.534 g/cm\u00b3) than sodium. The data for Q shows a lower melting point and a higher density than both sodium and rubidium, which is inconsistent with the properties of lithium.\n\n**C) potassium**\nPotassium is a Group 1 alkali metal located between sodium and rubidium. Therefore, its properties should be intermediate between those of sodium and rubidium. For example, potassium's melting point is 63.5\u00b0C, which is between sodium's (98\u00b0C) and rubidium's (39\u00b0C).

With the exception of Helium, all elements in this group have eight electrons in their outermost electron shell (valence shell). This is known as a stable octet. Helium, being in the first period, has its outermost shell as the first electron shell, which is full with just two electrons. This complete outer shell of electrons makes these elements chemically stable and very unreactive.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. They all react with Group I elements to form ionic compounds.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Group VIII elements are exceptionally unreactive due to their full valence shells. They have no tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons to form chemical bonds under normal conditions. Group I elements (the alkali metals) are highly reactive and readily lose one electron to form a +1 ion. While some compounds of the heavier noble gases (like xenon and krypton) can be formed with highly electronegative elements under special conditions, they generally do not react, and certainly not with Group I elements to form ionic compounds.\n\n**C. They are all diatomic molecules.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A diatomic molecule consists of two atoms chemically bonded together (e.g., O\u2082, N\u2082). Group VIII elements are stable as individual atoms because their outer electron shells are already full. They do not need to share electrons with other atoms to achieve stability. Therefore, they exist as individual, unbonded atoms and are described as being monatomic.\n\n**D. They are all liquids at room temperature and pressure.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The elements in Group VIII have very weak intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces). As a result, they have very low boiling points, all of which are well below standard room temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C).

The formula C\u2085H\u2081\u2080 corresponds to the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099, which represents alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n\n**B: C\u2085H\u2081\u2082, -51 \u00b0C**\nThis option is incorrect because the boiling point of -51 \u00b0C contradicts the established trend for the homologous series. As the number of carbon atoms in an alkane increases, the boiling point also increases due to stronger intermolecular forces. Since butane (C\u2084H\u2081\u2080) has a boiling point of 0 \u00b0C, pentane (C\u2085H\u2081\u2082) must have a boiling point higher than 0 \u00b0C. A value of -51 \u00b0C would be a decrease, which is incorrect.\n\n**C: C\u2085H\u2081\u2080, -51 \u00b0C**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the molecular formula C\u2085H\u2081\u2080 is incorrect for an alkane (it should be C\u2085H\u2081\u2082). Secondly, the boiling point of -51 \u00b0C is incorrect as it does not follow the increasing trend observed in the homologous series of alkanes."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_232.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "32 which displayed formula represents the ester formed by the reaction of propan-1-ol with\nethanoic acid?\na b\nip il -\n= ho oh ee i hoh oh\n| \\ | 1 1 | \\ tot\nme tt ce et tt\nh h h h h h\ncc d\nil - ip\nope hoh vod hoh\n| | \\ tl | \\ |\net met\nh h h h", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe formation of an ester, known as esterification, occurs when a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.

These crops are considered renewable resources because they can be grown and harvested repeatedly. This sustainable aspect is a significant advantage over methods that rely on finite, non-renewable resources. The catalytic addition of steam to ethene, in contrast, uses ethene derived from the cracking of crude oil, which is a non-renewable fossil fuel. Therefore, the use of a renewable raw material is a key advantage of fermentation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Catalytic addition requires a high temperature and pressure.**\nThis statement is factually correct; the hydration of ethene to produce ethanol requires conditions of high temperature (around 300\u00b0C) and high pressure (around 60-70 atmospheres). However, these conditions are a significant *disadvantage*, not an advantage. Maintaining high temperatures and pressures requires a large input of energy, leading to high operational costs. It also necessitates the use of expensive, robust industrial equipment to safely contain the reaction.\n\n**B. Ethanol produced by fermentation is extracted by distillation.**\nThis statement is also factually correct. Fermentation produces a dilute aqueous solution of ethanol (typically 10-15%). To obtain pure ethanol, this mixture must be separated by fractional distillation, a process that itself consumes a significant amount of energy. The necessity of this additional, energy-intensive purification step is a *disadvantage* of the fermentation method, not an advantage.\n\n**C. Fermentation is a batch process.**\nThis statement is true; fermentation is carried out in batches, where the reactants are loaded into a vessel, the process is allowed to complete, and then the product is removed. In contrast, the catalytic hydration of ethene is a continuous process. For large-scale industrial production, continuous processes are generally more efficient, faster, and more economical than batch processes.

Polymers containing this linkage are known as polyamides. Polyamides are formed through a process called condensation polymerisation. In this type of reaction, two different monomers, typically a dicarboxylic acid (containing two -COOH groups) and a diamine (containing two -NH\u2082 groups), react. During the reaction, the hydroxyl group (-OH) from a carboxylic acid group and a hydrogen atom (-H) from an amine group are removed to form a water molecule (H\u2082O). The remaining parts of the monomers then join together to form the amide link. Since this process is repeated many times to create the long polymer chain, water is produced as a small molecule by-product.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Alkenes are polymerised to make the polymer.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The polymerisation of alkenes is a type of addition polymerisation. In this process, the double bond (C=C) in alkene monomers breaks, and the monomers add to one another to form a long saturated chain. The resulting polymer, such as poly(ethene), has a backbone consisting only of carbon atoms. The polymer shown in the question contains nitrogen and oxygen atoms within its backbone as part of the amide linkages, which is characteristic of a condensation polymer, not an addition polymer formed from alkenes.\n\n**B. It is a polyester.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A polyester is a polymer that contains ester linkages (-COO-) in its main chain. These are typically formed by the condensation polymerisation of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol (an alcohol with two -OH groups). The polymer shown does not contain ester linkages; instead, it contains amide linkages (-CO-NH-). Therefore, it is a polyamide, not a polyester.\n\n**C. It is an addition polymer.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Addition polymerisation is a process where monomer units add to one another without the loss of any atoms or molecules. The polymer is the only product formed. The polymer shown is a polyamide, which is formed by condensation polymerisation. Condensation polymerisation is characterised by the joining of monomers with the elimination of a small molecule, such as water.

In a sealed container of fixed volume, this increased speed leads to *more frequent* and more forceful collisions with the container walls, not less frequent collisions."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_242.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "2 four experiments, each containing a different acidic gas, are set up as shown.\nthe dividing glass plates are removed at the same time.\nin which set of apparatus does the litmus turn red first?\na b\ndamp blue damp blue\nlitmus paper litmus paper\nair air\nglass plate glass plate\ncarbon dioxide, co, hydrogen chloride, hcl\ncc d\ndamp blue damp blue\nlitmus paper litmus paper\nair air\nglass plate glass plate\nnitrogen dioxide, no, sulfur dioxide, so,", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe experiment investigates the rate of diffusion of different gases. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. The rate at which a gas diffuses is inversely proportional to the square root of its relative molecular mass (M\u1d63), a principle known as Graham's Law of Diffusion. This means that gases with a lower relative molecular mass diffuse faster than gases with a higher relative molecular mass.\n\nTo determine which gas will reach the damp blue litmus paper first, we must calculate and compare the relative molecular masses of the four gases:\n\n*   **A: Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082):** M\u1d63 = 12.0 + (2 \u00d7 16.0) = 44.0\n*   **B: Hydrogen chloride (HCl):** M\u1d63 = 1.0 + 35.5 = 36.5\n*   **C: Nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082):** M\u1d63 = 14.0 + (2 \u00d7 16.0) = 46.0\n*   **D: Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082):** M\u1d63 = 32.1 + (2 \u00d7 16.0) = 64.1\n\nHydrogen chloride (HCl) has the lowest relative molecular mass (36.5) of the four gases. Consequently, its particles will move and spread out the fastest. It will be the first gas to travel up the gas jar and reach the damp blue litmus paper. Upon contact with the water on the litmus paper, HCl gas dissolves to form hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid that turns the litmus paper red.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) has a relative molecular mass of 44.0. While it is an acidic gas that will turn damp blue litmus paper red by forming carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083), its M\u1d63 is higher than that of hydrogen chloride (36.5). Because it is a heavier gas, it will diffuse more slowly than hydrogen chloride. Therefore, the litmus paper in apparatus A will change colour after the litmus paper in apparatus B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082) has a relative molecular mass of 46.0. It is an acidic gas that dissolves in water to form a mixture of nitrous acid and nitric acid, which will turn damp blue litmus paper red. However, its M\u1d63 (46.0) is greater than that of hydrogen chloride (36.5). As a heavier gas, nitrogen dioxide will diffuse more slowly. Consequently, the litmus paper in apparatus C will turn red after the one in apparatus B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) has a relative molecular mass of 64.1. It is an acidic gas that forms sulfurous acid (H\u2082SO\u2083) in the presence of water, causing damp blue litmus paper to turn red. Of the four options, sulfur dioxide has the highest relative molecular mass. This means it is the heaviest gas and will diffuse the most slowly.

Atoms of Group I elements have one electron in their outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, they tend to lose this single valence electron. When a neutral potassium atom loses one negatively charged electron, it becomes a positive ion (a cation) with a charge of 1+, written as K\u207a.\n\nFluorine (F) is an element in Group VII. Atoms of Group VII elements have seven electrons in their outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell of eight electrons, also known as an octet), they tend to gain one electron. When a neutral fluorine atom gains one negatively charged electron, it becomes a negative ion (an anion) with a charge of 1\u2013, written as F\u207b.\n\nTherefore, when potassium and fluorine react to form an ionic bond, the potassium atom transfers its electron to the fluorine atom, producing the ions K\u207a and F\u207b.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: K\u207a and F\u207a**\nThis option is incorrect because while potassium correctly forms a K\u207a ion, fluorine does not form an F\u207a ion. As a Group VII element, fluorine has a high electronegativity and readily gains an electron to achieve a stable octet. Losing an electron to form a positive ion (F\u207a) would require a large amount of energy and would result in an unstable electron configuration.\n\n**C: K\u207b and F\u207b**\nThis option is incorrect because potassium does not form a K\u207b ion. As a Group I metal, potassium achieves stability by losing its single valence electron to form a positive ion (K\u207a). Gaining an electron to form a negative ion (K\u207b) would create an unstable electron arrangement. While the fluoride ion (F\u207b) is correctly identified, the potassium ion is not.\n\n**D: K\u207b and F\u207a**\nThis option is incorrect because it reverses the correct ion formation for both elements. Metals like potassium lose electrons to form positive ions (cations), not negative ions (anions). Non-metals like fluorine gain electrons to form negative ions (anions), not positive ions (cations).

The number of electron shells determines the period, and the number of outer (valence) electrons determines the group of an element in the periodic table. Since both X and Y are in the same period and the same group, they must be atoms of the same element. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons (atomic number).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Statement 1 (X and Y are isotopes):** Isotopes are defined as atoms of the same element (i.e., having the same number of protons) but with different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. The problem explicitly states that X and Y have different mass numbers. Since we have already established that X and Y are atoms of the same element, they fit the definition of isotopes perfectly. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Statement 2 (X and Y have the same total number of electrons):** Since X and Y are atoms of the same element, they have the same number of protons. Atoms are electrically neutral, meaning the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Consequently, X and Y must have the same total number of electrons. This is also consistent with them having the same number of electron shells and outer electrons, which implies identical electron configurations. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Statement 3 (X and Y have the same chemical properties):** The chemical properties of an atom are determined by its electron configuration, specifically the number of valence electrons, as these are the electrons involved in chemical bonding. Since X and Y are isotopes of the same element, they have identical electron configurations and the same number of valence electrons. Therefore, they will react in the same manner and exhibit the same chemical properties. Therefore, statement 3 is correct.\n\nSince all three statements are correct, option A is the correct choice.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B (1 and 2 only):** This option is incorrect because it omits the valid statement 3. Isotopes of an element have identical electron configurations, which means they have the same chemical properties. Therefore, statement 3 is also correct.\n*   **C (1 and 3 only):** This option is incorrect because it omits the valid statement 2. Since isotopes are atoms of the same element, they have the same number of protons. To be neutral atoms, they must also have the same total number of electrons. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.\n*   **D (2 and 3 only):** This option is incorrect because it omits the valid statement 1. The definition of isotopes is atoms of the same element with different mass numbers. The provided information\u2014that X and Y are the same element but have different mass numbers\u2014directly leads to the conclusion that they are isotopes.

All of its valence electrons are localised in strong covalent bonds between silicon and oxygen atoms. There are no free-moving electrons or ions to carry an electric current. Therefore, solid silicon(IV) oxide does not conduct electricity.\n\nSince neither compound has mobile charge carriers in the solid state, neither can conduct electricity in this form.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) They are not soluble in water.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the two compounds have different solubilities in water.\n*   **Lithium chloride** is a typical ionic compound and is soluble in water. The polar water molecules are attracted to the charged ions (Li\u207a and Cl\u207b), surrounding them and overcoming the electrostatic forces holding the ionic lattice together.\n*   **Silicon(IV) oxide**, as a giant covalent structure, is insoluble in water. A large amount of energy would be needed to break the numerous strong covalent bonds throughout the structure, and the interaction with water molecules does not provide sufficient energy to do so.\n\n**B) They conduct electricity when melted.**\nThis statement is incorrect because only lithium chloride conducts electricity when molten.\n*   When **lithium chloride** is melted, the ions (Li\u207a and Cl\u207b) are no longer held in a fixed lattice and become mobile. These free-moving ions can carry an electric current, so molten LiCl is a good conductor of electricity.\n*   When **silicon(IV) oxide** is melted, it remains a covalent substance.

A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a fuel (hydrogen) and an oxidising agent (oxygen) into electricity through a pair of redox reactions. Hydrogen is oxidised at the anode, and oxygen is reduced at the cathode. The overall reaction is 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2H\u2082O.

It shows the products at a higher energy level than the reactants, which is characteristic of an endothermic reaction. However, it states that the enthalpy change (\u0394H) is -24 kJ/mol.

However, the enthalpy change (\u0394H) is stated as +24 kJ/mol. A positive \u0394H value signifies an endothermic reaction.

The enthalpy change of a reaction is the *net* energy difference between these two processes, not their sum. Bond breaking requires energy input, while bond formation releases energy, so the energy released must be subtracted from the energy absorbed.\n\n**B: -884 kJ/mol**\nThis answer likely arises from a combination of errors. It is exactly double the value of option D (-442 kJ/mol). This suggests that the calculation error leading to -442 kJ/mol was made first, and then the result was incorrectly multiplied by 2, perhaps in an attempt to account for the 2 moles of water produced. This indicates a misunderstanding of both how to count the bonds and how the final enthalpy change relates to the stoichiometry of the overall reaction.\n\n**D: -442 kJ/mol**\nThis incorrect value stems from an error in counting the number of bonds formed in the product. While the energy for bonds broken is correctly calculated as 1370 kJ, the energy for bonds formed is miscalculated. This error occurs if one assumes that only two O-H bonds are formed in total, instead of the correct four. This could happen by either forgetting that each water molecule has two O-H bonds, or by ignoring the stoichiometric coefficient of 2 in front of H\u2082O. This would lead to a calculation of 1370 kJ - (2 \u00d7 464 kJ) = 1370 kJ - 928 kJ = +442 kJ. A final error would be to assign a negative sign because combustion is an exothermic process, resulting in -442 kJ/mol."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_252.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "12 which process involves a chemical change?\na adding sodium to water\nb _ boiling water\nc_ dissolving sodium chloride in water\nd producing water from aqueous sodium chloride", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation\n\n**A. adding sodium to water (Correct)**\n\nA chemical change is a process that results in the formation of new chemical substances. When solid sodium (Na) is added to water (H\u2082O), a vigorous chemical reaction occurs. The sodium reacts with the water to produce two new substances: aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H\u2082). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n2Na(s) + 2H\u2082O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + H\u2082(g)\nSince the original reactants (sodium and water) are converted into new products with different chemical properties, this is a chemical change.\n\n**B. boiling water (Incorrect)**\n\nBoiling is a physical change, specifically a change of state from liquid to gas. When water boils, liquid water (H\u2082O(l)) is converted into gaseous water or steam (H\u2082O(g)). The chemical composition of the substance remains H\u2082O throughout the process. No new substances are formed, so this is a physical change, not a chemical one.\n\n**C. dissolving sodium chloride in water (Incorrect)**\n\nDissolving is a physical process. When sodium chloride (NaCl), an ionic compound, is added to water, it dissociates into its constituent ions (Na\u207a and Cl\u207b), which then spread throughout the water. While the ions are separated, no new chemical substance is created. The original components, water and sodium chloride, can be recovered by a physical process such as evaporation. Therefore, dissolving is a physical change.\n\n**D. producing water from aqueous sodium chloride (Incorrect)**\n\nThis describes the separation of a mixture. An aqueous sodium chloride solution is a mixture of water and dissolved sodium chloride. Separating the water from the salt can be achieved through physical processes like distillation or reverse osmosis. Distillation, for example, involves boiling the water (a physical change) and then condensing the steam back into liquid water, leaving the salt behind.

The curve begins at a high value on the y-axis at time zero and then decreases, eventually levelling off. This pattern is characteristic of a reactant being consumed. In the reaction `Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 ZnCl\u2082(aq) + H\u2082(g)`, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a reactant. At the start of the experiment, the concentration of HCl is at its maximum. As the reaction proceeds, HCl is used up, causing its concentration to decrease. The rate of reaction is fastest at the beginning (indicated by the steep slope of the curve) because the concentration of reactants is highest. As the concentration of HCl decreases, the rate of reaction slows down (the slope becomes less steep), until the reaction stops when one of the reactants is completely consumed, at which point the concentration of HCl becomes constant (the curve flattens). Therefore, the y-axis represents the concentration of HCl.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. amount of ZnCl\u2082 produced**\n\nZinc chloride (ZnCl\u2082) is a product of the reaction. At the beginning of the reaction (time = 0), no product has been formed, so the amount of ZnCl\u2082 is zero. As the reaction proceeds, ZnCl\u2082 is continuously produced, meaning its amount increases over time until the reaction is complete. A graph plotting the amount of ZnCl\u2082 produced versus time would start at the origin (0,0) and curve upwards, which is the opposite of the graph shown.\n\n**C. mass of Zn reacted**\n\nZinc (Zn) is a reactant, but the option refers to the \"mass of Zn *reacted*\". At the start of the reaction (time = 0), no zinc has yet reacted, so this value is zero. As the reaction progresses, an increasing mass of zinc is consumed. Therefore, a graph of the mass of Zn reacted versus time would start at the origin (0,0) and curve upwards as more zinc is used up. This is contrary to the decreasing trend shown in the graph. (Note: A graph of the *remaining* mass of zinc would show a decreasing curve, but that is not the option provided).\n\n**D. volume of H\u2082 produced**\n\nHydrogen gas (H\u2082) is a product of the reaction. The volume of gas produced is zero at the start of the reaction (time = 0). As the reaction occurs, hydrogen gas is evolved, so its volume increases over time. The graph would show a curve starting from the origin (0,0) and rising, eventually flattening out when the reaction stops.

Therefore, Experiment 2 will be faster than Experiment 4.\n\nIn summary, Experiment 2 and Experiment 4 produce the same volume of gas but at different rates.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Experiment 1 produces less gas than experiment 4, but at the same rate.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the rates are different. While Experiment 1 (0.0125 mol H\u2082O\u2082) does produce less gas than Experiment 4 (0.0250 mol H\u2082O\u2082), the rate of reaction is slower in Experiment 1. This is because Experiment 1 is conducted at a lower temperature (25\u00b0C) than Experiment 4 (40\u00b0C). A higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions, and thus a faster reaction rate.\n\n**B. Experiment 2 produces more gas than experiment 1, but at the same rate.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the rates are different. While Experiment 2 (0.0250 mol H\u2082O\u2082) does produce more gas than Experiment 1 (0.0125 mol H\u2082O\u2082), the rate of reaction is significantly faster in Experiment 2. This is due to two factors: Experiment 2 has a higher concentration of H\u2082O\u2082 (2.0 mol/dm\u00b3 vs. 1.0 mol/dm\u00b3) and a higher temperature (40\u00b0C vs. 25\u00b0C). Both of these factors increase the rate of reaction.\n\n**D. Experiment 3 and experiment 4 each produce the same volume of gas and at the same rate.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the rates are different. Both experiments start with the same number of moles of H\u2082O\u2082 (0.0250 mol) and are at the same temperature (40\u00b0C), so they will produce the same volume of gas. However, Experiment 4 uses manganese(IV) oxide as a catalyst, while Experiment 3 does not. A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, which significantly increases the rate of reaction.

The key stage is the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) to sulfur trioxide (SO\u2083), which is a reversible and exothermic reaction: 2SO\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) \u21cc 2SO\u2083(g). The typical conditions are chosen to balance reaction rate, equilibrium yield, and economic costs.\n\n*   **Catalyst:** The catalyst used to increase the rate of this reaction is **vanadium(V) oxide (V\u2082O\u2085)**.\n*   **Temperature:** A compromise temperature of approximately **450 \u00b0C** is used. The forward reaction is exothermic, so a lower temperature would favour a higher yield according to Le Chatelier's principle. However, a lower temperature would also significantly slow down the rate of reaction. 450 \u00b0C provides a fast enough reaction rate while still achieving a very high equilibrium yield (over 98%).\n*   **Pressure:** The forward reaction results in a decrease in the number of moles of gas (from 3 to 2). Le Chatelier's principle suggests that a high pressure would favour the formation of products. However, the equilibrium position already lies far to the right, providing a high yield even at low pressures. Therefore, to minimize operational costs, a relatively low pressure of about 1-2 atmospheres (atm), which is approximately **100-200 kPa**, is sufficient.\n\nRow C correctly identifies all three of these typical industrial conditions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The catalyst and temperature are incorrect. Iron is the catalyst used in the Haber process for ammonia production, not the Contact process. The temperature of 300 \u00b0C is too low for the vanadium(V) oxide catalyst to function effectively, leading to an impractically slow reaction rate.\n\n**B:** The catalyst and pressure are incorrect. Iron is the catalyst for the Haber process. While high pressure would favour the forward reaction, 20 000 kPa (approx. 200 atm) is unnecessarily high and expensive for the Contact process because a high yield is already achieved at much lower pressures. These conditions (iron catalyst, high pressure, 450 \u00b0C) are characteristic of the Haber process.\n\n**D:** The pressure and temperature are incorrect. While vanadium(V) oxide is the correct catalyst, the pressure of 20 000 kPa is far too high for this process and not economically viable. The temperature of 300 \u00b0C is too low for the catalyst to be sufficiently active, resulting in a very slow reaction rate.

In this process, the copper species has lost its oxygen atom. Furthermore, the oxidation state of copper changes from +2 in CuO to 0 in its elemental form, Cu.

A weak acid partially dissociates in aqueous solution.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The strength of an acid is determined by the extent to which it ionises, or dissociates, in water to produce hydrogen ions (H\u207a). A weak acid, such as ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH), only partially ionises. This means that when it is dissolved in water, a reversible reaction occurs, and an equilibrium is established. The resulting solution contains a low concentration of H\u207a ions along with a large proportion of undissociated acid molecules.\n\nThe partial dissociation of a generic weak acid, HA, can be represented by the following equilibrium equation:\nHA(aq) \u21cc H\u207a(aq) + A\u207b(aq)\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**B. An acid accepts protons when added to water.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. According to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory, an acid is defined as a proton (H\u207a ion) **donor**, not a proton acceptor. When an acid is added to water, it donates a proton to a water molecule. A substance that accepts protons is defined as a base. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) donates a proton to water: HCl + H\u2082O \u2192 H\u2083O\u207a + Cl\u207b.\n\n**C. Ethanoic acid acts as a strong acid when added to water.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH) is a classic example of a weak acid. A strong acid, like hydrochloric acid, completely ionises in water. In contrast, ethanoic acid only partially ionises, meaning only a small fraction of its molecules release hydrogen ions at any given time. Therefore, it does not act as a strong acid.\n\n**D. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that ionises in water to form H\u207b ions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, it does not form H\u207b ions. Acids ionise in water to produce **hydrogen ions**, which have a positive charge (H\u207a).

The sodium ions (`Na\u207a`) and nitrate ions (`NO\u2083\u207b`) are spectator ions, as they remain in the aqueous solution and do not participate in the formation of the solid precipitate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) addition:** An addition reaction is a type of reaction, common in organic chemistry, where two or more molecules combine to form a single, larger molecule. This usually involves the breaking of a double or triple bond. The reaction shown involves the exchange of ions between two compounds, not the combination of reactants into a single product.\n\n**B) redox:** A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction involves a change in the oxidation states of one or more elements due to the transfer of electrons. To determine if this is a redox reaction, we can check the oxidation states of all elements on both sides of the equation:\n*   On the reactant side: `Pb` in `Pb\u00b2\u207a` is +2; `N` in `NO\u2083\u207b` is +5; `Na` in `Na\u207a` is +1; `I` in `I\u207b` is -1.\n*   On the product side: `Pb` in `PbI\u2082` is +2; `N` in `NO\u2083\u207b` is +5; `Na` in `Na\u207a` is +1; `I` in `PbI\u2082` is -1.\nSince the oxidation states of all the elements remain unchanged, there has been no transfer of electrons, and therefore, it is not a redox reaction.\n\n**C) neutralisation:** A neutralisation reaction is a specific reaction between an acid and a base, which typically results in the formation of a salt and water. The given equation does not involve an acid or a base as reactants, nor is water formed as a product. The reactants are ions from two different salts dissolved in water."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_260.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "20 which compound is likely to be coloured?\na kmno, b kno3; c k,co3 d k2so,", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe colour of many inorganic compounds is determined by the presence of a transition metal.

In a pure metal, the atoms are all of the same size and are arranged in a regular, ordered lattice. This regularity allows the layers of atoms to slide over one another with relative ease when a force is applied, making pure metals comparatively soft and malleable.\n\nThe introduction of different-sized atoms into this lattice, as occurs in an alloy, disrupts the regular arrangement of the layers. This disruption prevents the layers from sliding past each other smoothly. A significantly greater force is required to overcome this resistance and deform the material. Therefore, alloys are harder and stronger than their constituent pure metals.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) weaker / larger atoms slide more easily over smaller atoms**\nThis statement is incorrect on both points. Firstly, alloys are stronger than pure metals, not weaker. Secondly, the presence of atoms of different sizes disrupts the regular lattice structure, which hinders the sliding of atomic layers, making it more difficult, not easier.\n\n**B) weaker / larger atoms make it harder for layers to slide over one another**\nThis statement correctly explains the mechanism for increased strength (disruption of layers makes sliding harder), but it incorrectly concludes that this makes the alloy weaker.

When exposed to the atmosphere, it rapidly reacts with oxygen to form a thin, tough, and non-porous layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface. This layer is chemically inert and acts as a protective barrier, preventing the underlying pure aluminium metal from coming into contact with the dilute hydrochloric acid. The reaction between the acid and the aluminium metal, which would produce hydrogen gas and thus effervescence (2Al + 6HCl \u2192 2AlCl\u2083 + 3H\u2082), cannot occur until this protective oxide layer is first dissolved by the acid. As this initial process is slow and does not produce a gas, no immediate effervescence is observed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Aluminium does not make a gas when it reacts with an acid.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Aluminium is a metal that is positioned above hydrogen in the reactivity series. As such, it is reactive enough to displace hydrogen from dilute acids like hydrochloric acid, producing hydrogen gas (H\u2082) and an aluminium salt. The absence of an immediate reaction is due to a barrier, not an inherent lack of reactivity.\n\n**C. Aluminium is less reactive than hydrogen.**\nThis statement is incorrect. According to the reactivity series, aluminium is significantly more reactive than hydrogen. This high reactivity is why it should, in principle, react vigorously with dilute acids to displace hydrogen gas.

Aluminium only reacts with concentrated acid.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the reaction rate would be faster with a more concentrated acid, aluminium is sufficiently reactive to react with dilute acids.

Air is a mixture of gases, approximately 21% of which is oxygen. By replacing the air inside the container with argon, the oxygen is removed from the environment surrounding the nails. Argon is a noble gas, which means it is chemically inert and does not react with iron. Since one of the essential reactants (oxygen) for rusting is no longer present, the chemical reaction cannot occur, and the iron nails will be protected from rust.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Leave the lid off.**\nThis action would not prevent rusting; it would likely accelerate it. The air already inside the airtight container contains enough oxygen and water vapour to initiate rusting. Leaving the lid off would allow a continuous supply of fresh air from the atmosphere to come into contact with the nails. This would provide an unlimited source of both oxygen and water vapour, causing the nails to rust more quickly and extensively.\n\n**C. Put the container in a warm place.**\nRusting is a chemical reaction. Increasing the temperature generally increases the rate of chemical reactions because it provides the reactant particles with more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions. Therefore, placing the container in a warm place would cause the nails to rust faster, not prevent rusting.\n\n**D. Seal the container in a bag.**\nThe container is already described as \"airtight,\" meaning it is sealed from the outside environment. The oxygen and water vapour required for the nails to rust are already trapped inside the container.

For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this boiling point is exactly 100\u00b0C. The presence of dissolved impurities, such as salts or other liquids, will elevate the boiling point and cause the liquid to boil over a range of temperatures rather than at a single, constant temperature. Therefore, heating the sample and observing a sharp, constant boiling point at 100\u00b0C is a reliable and standard chemical test to confirm the purity of water.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. Evaporate the water to see if any solids remain.**\nThis test is used to determine the presence of dissolved, non-volatile solids (like salts). If no solid residue remains after evaporation, it only proves the absence of this specific type of impurity. The water could still contain other impurities, such as dissolved volatile liquids (e.g., ethanol) or dissolved gases, which would also evaporate and go undetected. Thus, this test is insufficient to confirm the overall purity of the water.\n\n**C.

In its anhydrous (water-free) state, it is blue. When it comes into contact with water, it becomes hydrated and turns pink. This test would produce a positive result (turn pink) for both pure and impure water, as it only confirms that water molecules are present. It provides no information about other substances that might be dissolved in the water.\n\n**D. Use universal indicator paper to check its pH.**\nThis test measures the acidity or alkalinity of the sample. Pure water is neutral and has a pH of 7.

Methane (CH\u2084) is an alkane, which is a saturated hydrocarbon containing only single C-H and C-C bonds. Addition reactions are characteristic of unsaturated compounds (like alkenes with C=C double bonds), where the double bond breaks to allow atoms to be added to the molecule. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom in the methane molecule is replaced, or substituted, by a chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **\"The ultraviolet light provides the activation energy.\" (Correct)**\n    The reaction between an alkane and a halogen requires an input of energy to start, which is the activation energy. In this case, ultraviolet (UV) light provides the energy needed to break the strong covalent bond within the chlorine molecule (Cl-Cl). This process, known as homolytic fission, creates highly reactive chlorine free radicals (Cl\u2022). These free radicals then initiate the chain reaction with methane. Without UV light, the reaction does not proceed under normal conditions.\n\n3.  **\"An equation for the reaction is CH\u2084 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2082Cl\u2082 + H\u2082.\" (Incorrect)**\n    This equation is incorrect. In the substitution reaction of alkanes with halogens, the hydrogen atom that is replaced combines with the other halogen atom from the diatomic molecule to form a hydrogen halide. For every chlorine atom that substitutes a hydrogen atom on the methane, a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is produced, not hydrogen gas (H\u2082). The correct overall equation to produce dichloromethane (CH\u2082Cl\u2082) would be:\n    CH\u2084 + 2Cl\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2082Cl\u2082 + 2HCl\n\n4.  **\"CH\u2083Cl is made in the reaction.\" (Correct)**\n    The substitution of methane with chlorine is a stepwise process that produces a mixture of chlorinated methanes. The first substitution product formed is chloromethane (CH\u2083Cl), as shown in the equation:\n    CH\u2084 + Cl\u2082 \u2192 CH\u2083Cl + HCl\n    If chlorine is not a limiting reactant, further substitution can occur, leading to the formation of dichloromethane (CH\u2082Cl\u2082), trichloromethane (CHCl\u2083), and tetrachloromethane (CCl\u2084). However, chloromethane is a definite product of the initial reaction.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStatements 2 and 4 are correct. The UV light supplies the activation energy to initiate the reaction, and chloromethane (CH\u2083Cl) is one of the products formed during this substitution reaction.

This reaction is typically slow under normal conditions. To increase the rate of reaction and improve the yield of the ester, a strong acid catalyst is used. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is the standard catalyst for this process.\n\nSulfuric acid serves two crucial functions in esterification:\n1.  **Catalyst:** It protonates the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid, which makes the carbonyl carbon more susceptible to attack by the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the alcohol. This lowers the activation energy of the reaction, thereby increasing its rate.\n2.  **Dehydrating Agent:** Esterification is an equilibrium reaction where water is a product (Carboxylic Acid + Alcohol \u21cc Ester + Water). Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent and removes the water as it is formed. According to Le Chatelier's principle, removing a product shifts the equilibrium position to the right, favouring the formation of more ester and thus increasing the overall yield.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A) aqueous potassium manganate(VII)**\nAqueous potassium manganate(VII) (KMnO\u2084) is a powerful oxidizing agent, not a catalyst for esterification. It is commonly used in organic chemistry to oxidize alcohols. For instance, it can oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid. Using it in an esterification mixture would lead to unwanted side reactions, specifically the oxidation of the starting alcohol, rather than promoting ester formation.\n\n**B) iron**\nIron (Fe) is a transition metal that acts as a catalyst in several important industrial processes, most notably the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. It is not used as a catalyst in esterification reactions.\n\n**D) vanadium(V) oxide**\nVanadium(V) oxide (V\u2082O\u2085) is an important industrial catalyst used in the Contact process for the large-scale production of sulfuric acid.

Although the temperature remains constant during this process (as indicated by the plateau), the particles are continuously losing potential energy in the form of heat.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Steam is condensing into water.**\nCondensation is the phase change from a gas to a liquid. For water, this process occurs at its boiling point, which is 100\u00b0C. The horizontal plateau on the graph between points X and Y is at 0\u00b0C. This temperature corresponds to the freezing point of water, not its condensation point.\n\n**B. The temperature of the water is decreasing.**\nOn a temperature-time graph, a decreasing temperature is represented by a downward-sloping line. The segment between points X and Y is a horizontal line, or a plateau. This indicates that the temperature is constant and not changing over this period. The constant temperature is a characteristic feature of a substance undergoing a phase change.\n\n**C. Ice is melting.**\nMelting is the phase change from a solid to a liquid, which requires the absorption of heat energy. This process would be shown on a heating curve, not a cooling curve.

A common mistake that could lead to a value close to this is using the atomic number (10) instead of the mass numbers (20, 21, and 22) in the calculation. The relative atomic mass must be a weighted average of the mass numbers. Since the most abundant isotope (over 90%) has a mass of 20, the final average must be very close to 20.\n\n**C. 21.00:** This value is incorrect. 21 is the mass number of one of the isotopes, \u00b2\u00b9Ne. However, the relative atomic mass is a weighted average of all isotopes, not the mass of a single isotope. Furthermore, since \u00b2\u00b9Ne has a very low abundance (0.27%), it contributes very little to the overall average mass.\n\n**D. 30.19:** This value is incorrect. The relative atomic mass of an element must lie between the mass number of its lightest isotope and its heaviest isotope. For this sample of neon, the relative atomic mass must be between 20 and 22.

A neutral potassium atom loses its single valence electron to form a stable positive ion (cation), K\u207a. The number of protons in the nucleus remains unchanged, but the number of electrons decreases by one. Therefore, the resulting potassium ion (K\u207a) has more protons (positive charges) than electrons (negative charges), giving it an overall positive charge.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Each potassium atom shares a pair of electrons with an iodine atom.**\nThis statement describes covalent bonding, where non-metal atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.

Within each methanol molecule, the atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds. However, between the individual methanol molecules, there are only weak intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds). Melting a substance involves overcoming the forces that hold the particles together in a fixed, solid lattice. In the case of methanol, only a small amount of thermal energy is needed to overcome these weak intermolecular forces. Therefore, methanol has a very low melting point.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. graphite**\nGraphite has a giant covalent (or giant molecular) structure. It consists of layers of carbon atoms, where each carbon atom is joined to three others by strong covalent bonds. To melt graphite, a very large amount of energy is required to break these strong covalent bonds throughout its structure. This results in a very high melting point, much higher than that of a simple molecular substance like methanol.\n\n**C. silicon(IV) oxide**\nSilicon(IV) oxide (SiO\u2082), also known as silica, has a giant covalent structure similar to diamond. Each silicon atom is covalently bonded to four oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom is bonded to two silicon atoms. This creates a vast, three-dimensional network of strong covalent bonds. A tremendous amount of energy is needed to break these numerous strong bonds, giving silicon(IV) oxide a very high melting point.\n\n**D. sodium chloride**\nSodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound with a giant ionic lattice structure. It is composed of a regular arrangement of positively charged sodium ions (Na\u207a) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl\u207b).

In a **dilute** solution, as specified in the question, hydroxide ions (from water) are preferentially discharged, producing oxygen gas.\n\n**B: anode: chlorine, cathode: potassium**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, chlorine gas is not produced at the anode in a dilute solution. Secondly, potassium metal is not produced at the cathode. Potassium is a very reactive metal, far more reactive than hydrogen. In the electrolysis of aqueous solutions of reactive metals, hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode instead of the metal.\n\n**D: anode: oxygen, cathode: potassium**\nThis is incorrect because potassium metal is not the product at the cathode.

The negative electrode is the cathode, where reduction occurs. In this electrolytic cell, the electrodes are made of copper, which is an active electrode.\n\nAt the positive electrode (anode), the copper atoms of the electrode are more easily oxidised than the chloride (Cl\u207b) or hydroxide (OH\u207b) ions in the solution.

Although energy is required to break the C-H and O=O bonds in the reactants, a much greater amount of energy is released when the new, stronger C=O and O-H bonds are formed in the products (carbon dioxide and water).

Firstly, the stoichiometric coefficient of 2 for water (2H\u2082O) is ignored, meaning the energy for forming only one mole of water (2 \u00d7 460 kJ) is included. Secondly, the formula for enthalpy change is incorrectly reversed to (Bonds formed \u2013 Bonds broken). The calculation would be: (1610 kJ + (2 \u00d7 460 kJ)) \u2013 2632 kJ = 2530 kJ \u2013 2632 kJ = \u2013102 kJ/mol.\n\n**C) +102 kJ/mol**\nThis result is obtained if the stoichiometric coefficient of 2 for water (2H\u2082O) is overlooked.

This calculation (3450 kJ \u2013 2632 kJ = +818 kJ/mol) incorrectly suggests the reaction is endothermic (absorbs energy overall), whereas the combustion of methane is a highly exothermic process (releases energy)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_295.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "15 hydrochloric acid is added to excess calcium carbonate in two separate experiments.\ntwo different concentrations of hydrochloric acid are used but the temperature is the same in\nboth experiments.\n\nthe graph of the results shows the volume of carbon dioxide gas given off over time.\n2.0 mol/dm*\nvolume of\ncarbon dioxide\ngiven off al\no 1.0 mol/dm?\ntime\nwhich row is correct?\nparticles in 2.0 mol/dm?\ncompared to 1.0mol/dm*\ncollision energy\na higher no change\nb higher higher\ncc lower no change\nd lower higher", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nAccording to collision theory, the rate of a chemical reaction depends on two main factors: the frequency of collisions and the energy of these collisions.\n\n*   **Collision Rate:** The concentration of a solution refers to the number of reactant particles per unit volume. The 2.0 mol/dm\u00b3 hydrochloric acid solution has twice the number of acid particles in the same volume compared to the 1.0 mol/dm\u00b3 solution.

The problem states that the temperature is the same in both experiments. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particles is the same in both the 2.0 mol/dm\u00b3 and 1.0 mol/dm\u00b3 solutions.

An oxide that reacts with a base is, by definition, an acidic oxide.\n\nSulfur is a non-metal. Generally, non-metals react with oxygen to form acidic oxides. For example, sulfur burns in oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), which is an acidic oxide. Acidic oxides react with aqueous solutions of bases in a neutralization reaction to form a salt and water.

Noble gases have a full outer shell of electrons, which makes them very stable and chemically unreactive. Consequently, argon does not readily form compounds with other elements, including oxygen. It does not form an oxide under normal conditions.\n\n**C. magnesium**\nMagnesium is a metal, specifically an alkaline earth metal in Group 2. Metals typically form basic oxides. Magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide (MgO), which is a basic oxide. Basic oxides react with acids to form a salt and water, but they do not react with bases.\n\n**D. copper**\nCopper is a transition metal. Like most metals, it forms basic oxides, such as copper(II) oxide (CuO).

This process involves mixing two different aqueous solutions, each containing a soluble salt. The cation from one solution combines with the anion from the other solution to form a compound that is insoluble in water. This insoluble solid, known as a precipitate, separates from the solution. The precipitate can then be collected by filtration, washed with distilled water to remove any soluble impurities, and dried.\n\nFor example, to produce the insoluble salt silver chloride (AgCl), a solution of soluble silver nitrate (AgNO\u2083) is mixed with a solution of soluble sodium chloride (NaCl). The silver ions (Ag\u207a) and chloride ions (Cl\u207b) combine to form solid silver chloride, which precipitates out of the solution.\n`AgNO\u2083(aq) + NaCl(aq) \u2192 AgCl(s) + NaNO\u2083(aq)`\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. addition of excess insoluble base to an acid**\nThis method is used to produce a **soluble** salt from an insoluble base (like a metal oxide or hydroxide) or an insoluble carbonate. The insoluble reactant is added in excess to an acid to ensure all the acid is neutralized. The unreacted solid is then removed by filtration, leaving an aqueous solution of the soluble salt. The salt can then be recovered by evaporating the water. For example, adding excess copper(II) oxide to sulfuric acid produces soluble copper(II) sulfate.\n\n**B. addition of excess metal to an acid**\nThis method is used to produce a **soluble** salt from a reactive metal (one that is more reactive than hydrogen). The metal is added in excess to an acid, and it reacts to form a salt and hydrogen gas. The excess unreacted metal is removed by filtration, leaving a solution of the soluble salt. For example, adding excess zinc metal to hydrochloric acid produces soluble zinc chloride.\n\n**D. titration using an acid and an alkali**\nTitration is a technique used to prepare a **soluble** salt from the reaction of an acid and a soluble base (an alkali). This method is necessary when both reactants are soluble, as excess reactant cannot be removed by filtration. An indicator is used to determine the exact volume of acid and alkali required for complete neutralization. The reaction produces an aqueous solution of the soluble salt.

More energy is required to overcome these stronger intermolecular forces to change the state from liquid to gas. Consequently, the boiling point increases down the group. The data confirms this, with the boiling point rising from -267 \u00b0C for helium to -152 \u00b0C for krypton.\n\n**Density Trend:**\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume. As you descend Group VIII, each successive element has a greater atomic mass because there are more protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

Group VII**\nGroup VII elements are the halogens. They are non-metals and exist as diatomic molecules. At room temperature, they are gases (fluorine, chlorine), a liquid (bromine), or a solid (iodine). They do not react with cold water to produce hydrogen gas.

This is because the reaction involves the metal displacing hydrogen from the acid. The given reactivity series shows that metal X is below hydrogen (H). This means X is less reactive than hydrogen and cannot displace it from dilute acids. Therefore, metal X does not react with dilute acids.\n\n2.  **Reduction of oxide by carbon:** Carbon is a reducing agent used to extract metals from their oxides. Carbon can reduce the oxide of a metal if the metal is less reactive than carbon. In the reactivity series, carbon is placed above hydrogen and the metals below it.

Mg**\n\nThe tendency of a species to lose electrons is a measure of its reactivity as a metal; more reactive metals lose electrons more readily. This property is described by the reactivity series, where metals higher up are more reactive. A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from a solution of its ions.\n\nThe question states that when solid zinc (Zn) is added to a solution containing magnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a), no reaction occurs. The potential displacement reaction would be:\nZn(s) + Mg\u00b2\u207a(aq) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + Mg(s)\n\nSince this reaction does not happen, it indicates that zinc is not reactive enough to displace magnesium. This means that magnesium (Mg) is more reactive than zinc (Zn). A higher reactivity corresponds to a greater tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. Therefore, among the neutral metals Mg and Zn, Mg has the greatest tendency to lose electrons.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**B. Mg\u00b2\u207a**\n\nThe species Mg\u00b2\u207a is a magnesium ion. It has already lost two electrons from its outer shell to achieve a stable electron configuration, similar to that of the noble gas neon. Because it is in a stable, oxidized state, it has a very low tendency to lose more electrons. Instead, it has a tendency to gain electrons (be reduced) to form neutral magnesium metal (Mg).\n\n**C. Zn**\n\nThe species Zn is neutral zinc metal. While zinc does have a tendency to lose electrons to form Zn\u00b2\u207a ions, the information provided allows us to compare its reactivity to magnesium. The fact that zinc does not react with magnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a) proves that zinc is less reactive than magnesium. Consequently, zinc has a lesser tendency to lose electrons compared to magnesium (Mg).\n\n**D. Zn\u00b2\u207a**\n\nThe species Zn\u00b2\u207a is a zinc ion. It is formed when a neutral zinc atom loses its two valence electrons. Having already been oxidized, this ion is in a relatively stable state and has a very low tendency to lose any more electrons.

It is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. For rusting to occur, two substances are essential: water and oxygen. Iron reacts with oxygen from the air in the presence of water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, a reddish-brown, flaky solid commonly known as rust. The overall chemical process can be summarised as the oxidation of iron metal. Without oxygen, this oxidation cannot take place, and therefore, iron will not rust.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. argon**\nArgon is a noble gas, belonging to Group 18 of the periodic table. The defining characteristic of noble gases is their chemical inertness. They have a full outer shell of electrons, which makes them very stable and unreactive. Consequently, argon does not participate in chemical reactions under normal conditions and does not react with iron to cause it to rust.\n\n**B. carbon dioxide**\nWhile carbon dioxide is not a primary requirement for rusting, its presence can accelerate the process. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form weak carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083). This acidic solution acts as an electrolyte, which facilitates the electrochemical process of rust formation, making it occur more quickly. However, the fundamental reaction that forms rust is between iron and oxygen, and this reaction can still occur in the absence of carbon dioxide.\n\n**C. nitrogen**\nNitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, comprising about 78% of the air. However, nitrogen gas (N\u2082) is very unreactive. The two nitrogen atoms in a molecule are held together by a strong triple covalent bond. A significant amount of energy is required to break this bond, so nitrogen does not readily react with iron under the conditions that cause rusting."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_308.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "28 which coating prevents iron from rusting even when the coating is damaged?\na grease\nb paint\nc plastic\nd= zinc", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nCoating iron with zinc provides sacrificial protection. Zinc is more reactive than iron, meaning it is more easily oxidised. When the zinc coating is scratched and the iron is exposed to oxygen and water, an electrochemical cell is formed. The more reactive zinc corrodes (is oxidised) in preference to the iron. The zinc acts as a sacrificial anode, losing electrons and forming zinc ions, while the iron is forced to act as the cathode, thereby being protected from oxidation (rusting). This protection remains effective as long as the zinc is present and in electrical contact with the iron, even if the coating is damaged. This process is also known as galvanising.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A, B, and C:**\n\nGrease, paint, and plastic all protect iron from rusting by acting as a physical barrier. They prevent the oxygen and water necessary for rusting from coming into direct contact with the iron surface. However, this method of protection is only effective as long as the coating remains intact. If the barrier is scratched, chipped, or broken, the underlying iron becomes exposed to the environment.

The primary purpose of adding limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO\u2083) to the blast furnace is to remove the main impurity found in iron ore, which is sand (silicon dioxide, SiO\u2082).

It neutralises the molten slag produced.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Limestone does not neutralize slag; a product of its decomposition (calcium oxide) reacts with an impurity (silicon dioxide) to *form* slag.

It releases carbon dioxide which reduces the iron(III) oxide.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Limestone does decompose to release carbon dioxide. However, the principal reducing agent in the blast furnace is carbon monoxide (CO), not carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). Carbon monoxide is produced from the reaction of hot coke (carbon) with oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Filtration removes fine, insoluble suspended particles that did not settle during sedimentation.\n\nFollowing filtration, the water must be disinfected to eliminate harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. This is represented by **Stage K**, which is **chlorination**. A small, controlled amount of chlorine gas or a chlorine-containing compound is added to the water. The chlorine kills the pathogens, making the water biologically safe to drink. Therefore, the correct sequence of stages after sedimentation is filtration followed by chlorination.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Distillation is a purification method that involves boiling water and condensing the steam. While it produces very pure water, it is an extremely energy-intensive and expensive process, making it unsuitable for the large-scale treatment of municipal water supplies.

The Earth's surface, having been warmed by incoming short-wavelength solar radiation, emits this thermal energy. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, have a molecular structure that allows them to effectively absorb this specific wavelength of outgoing thermal energy. This absorption process traps heat within the atmosphere that would otherwise escape into space, leading to the warming phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Therefore, the energy involved is thermal, and carbon dioxide molecules absorb this energy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While the type of energy involved is correctly identified as thermal, the outcome described is incorrect. The defining characteristic of a greenhouse gas is its ability to trap heat, which *reduces* the Earth's energy loss to space. By absorbing and re-radiating thermal energy back towards the surface, carbon dioxide molecules contribute to warming the planet, not cooling it by increasing energy loss.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect on two counts.

Air, which is drawn into the engine for combustion, is approximately 78% nitrogen (N\u2082) and 21% oxygen (O\u2082). The extreme heat provides sufficient energy to break the strong triple covalent bond in nitrogen molecules, allowing them to react with oxygen from the air to form nitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen monoxide (NO).\n\nIn the catalytic converter, harmful exhaust gases are converted into less harmful substances. Nitrogen monoxide (NO) is a pollutant that contributes to acid rain. Carbon monoxide (CO), a product of incomplete combustion, is a toxic gas. The catalytic converter facilitates a redox reaction where nitrogen monoxide is reduced to harmless nitrogen gas (N\u2082) and carbon monoxide is oxidised to less harmful carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The reaction is: 2NO + 2CO \u2192 N\u2082 + 2CO\u2082. This option correctly describes both processes.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:**\nThis option correctly identifies that oxides of nitrogen are formed from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen from the air. However, the reaction shown for the catalytic converter, while a possible reduction of nitrogen monoxide, is not the primary reaction. The main reducing agent that reacts with nitrogen monoxide in a catalytic converter is carbon monoxide (CO), a major product of incomplete combustion, not hydrogen gas (H\u2082).\n\n**C:**\nThis option incorrectly states that oxides of nitrogen are formed from nitrogen compounds in petrol. Petrol is a highly refined fuel consisting almost entirely of hydrocarbons (compounds of carbon and hydrogen). The source of nitrogen for the formation of NOx is the abundant nitrogen gas in the air, not the fuel itself. While the reaction shown for the catalytic converter is correct, the initial premise about the formation of NOx is wrong.\n\n**D:**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as with option C, it incorrectly identifies the source of nitrogen as being from compounds in petrol, when it is actually from the air. Secondly, as with option B, the reaction shown for the catalytic converter is not the primary one; the reaction with carbon monoxide (CO) is more significant than the reaction with hydrogen (H\u2082)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_313.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "33 which diagram shows the displayed formula for the named organic compound?\na b cc d\nh oo h h h o\u2014h h h\nok oe oe oe ah he 2 or\n; a ha a\nethanoic acid ethene ethanol methane", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe diagram shows the displayed formula for ethanol.

This classification is based on the chemical structure of the polymer chain. Polyamides are polymers where the repeating monomer units are linked together by amide bonds.

Addition polymerisation is a process where monomer units, typically unsaturated molecules like alkenes, add to one another in such a way that the polymer contains all the atoms of the monomer unit.

In this process, many ethene monomers (CH\u2082=CH\u2082) join together to form a long-chain polymer called poly(ethene).\n\nThe reaction proceeds by the breaking of the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within each ethene monomer. One of the bonds in the double bond is a pi (\u03c0) bond, which is weaker than the sigma (\u03c3) bond and breaks more easily. When this happens, each carbon atom can form a new single covalent bond with an adjacent monomer unit.\n\nThis process links the monomers end-to-end, creating a long, saturated hydrocarbon chain.

Structure C correctly depicts this repeating unit, showing a saturated backbone of single carbon-carbon bonds.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A**\nThis diagram shows the structure of a single ethene molecule (C\u2082H\u2084), which is the monomer. A monomer is the small molecule that acts as the starting material for polymerisation. The question asks for the structure of the product formed *after* polymerisation, which is the polymer, not the initial monomer.\n\n**B**\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows a repeating unit that still contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the main chain.

These are the electrons that are involved in forming chemical bonds through sharing, transfer, or delocalisation. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons (the same atomic number). In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Consequently, all isotopes of a particular element have the same number of electrons and the same electron configuration. This means they possess an identical number of outer shell electrons, causing them to participate in chemical reactions in the same way.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. They have different numbers of neutrons.**\nThis statement correctly defines what isotopes are, but it does not explain their chemical properties. Neutrons are located in the nucleus and are electrically neutral. They contribute to the mass of the atom but do not participate in chemical bonding. Chemical reactions involve the interactions of electrons, not neutrons. Therefore, the difference in neutron number explains the difference in mass between isotopes, not the similarity in their chemical reactions.\n\n**B. They have ions with different numbers of electrons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. When isotopes of an element form ions, they do so by gaining or losing the same number of electrons because they have the same number of valence electrons to begin with. For example, all isotopes of magnesium (Mg) will lose two electrons to form a Mg\u00b2\u207a ion. The formation of ions is a result of their chemical reactivity, which is consistent across all isotopes of an element.\n\n**D. They have the same number of protons.**\nWhile this statement is true for isotopes of an element, it is an incomplete explanation for their chemical behaviour. The number of protons defines the element and determines the number of electrons in a neutral atom. However, it is the arrangement of these electrons, and specifically the number in the outer shell, that directly dictates how an atom will react chemically. The most direct and precise reason for identical chemical reactions is the identical number of outer shell electrons, which itself is a consequence of having the same number of protons."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_325.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "5 magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide.\nwhat happens to magnesium atoms and oxygen atoms during this reaction?\na magnesium and oxygen share two electrons.\nb magnesium gains two electrons and oxygen loses two electrons.\nc magnesium loses one electron and oxygen gains one electron.\nd magnesium loses two electrons and oxygen gains two electrons.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves the formation of an ionic bond. Magnesium is a Group 2 metal with an electron configuration of 2,8,2. To achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell), it must lose the two electrons from its outermost shell. By losing two negatively charged electrons, the magnesium atom becomes a positively charged ion, Mg\u00b2\u207a.\n\nOxygen is a Group 16 non-metal with an electron configuration of 2,6. To achieve a stable electron configuration, it needs to gain two electrons to complete its outer shell. By gaining two electrons, the oxygen atom becomes a negatively charged ion, O\u00b2\u207b.\n\nTherefore, during the reaction, each magnesium atom transfers two electrons to an oxygen atom, forming the ionic compound magnesium oxide (MgO).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Magnesium and oxygen share two electrons.**\nThis is incorrect. The sharing of electrons occurs in covalent bonding, which typically happens between non-metal atoms. The reaction between a metal (magnesium) and a non-metal (oxygen) involves the transfer of electrons, resulting in the formation of an ionic bond, not a covalent bond.\n\n**B: Magnesium gains two electrons and oxygen loses two electrons.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes the direction of electron transfer. Metals, such as magnesium, are electropositive and tend to lose electrons to form positive ions (cations). Non-metals, such as oxygen, are electronegative and tend to gain electrons to form negative ions (anions). Magnesium loses electrons, and oxygen gains them.\n\n**C: Magnesium loses one electron and oxygen gains one electron.**\nThis is incorrect because the number of electrons transferred is wrong. Magnesium has two valence electrons and must lose both to achieve a stable, full outer shell. Oxygen has six valence electrons and must gain two to achieve a stable octet. The transfer of only one electron would not result in stable ions for either element."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_326.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "6 which row about the properties of both diamond and silicon(iv) oxide is correct?\n[| som, | ae\nof electricity molecule\na yes giant covalent\nb yes simple covalent\ncc no giant covalent\nd no simple covalent", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nBoth diamond and silicon(IV) oxide (silica) possess giant covalent structures. In these structures, atoms are held together by a vast, continuous network of strong covalent bonds.\n\n*   **Type of Structure:** Diamond consists of carbon atoms, each covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. Similarly, silicon(IV) oxide consists of silicon and oxygen atoms linked by strong covalent bonds in a regular, repeating lattice. This classifies them as giant covalent (or macromolecular) structures, not simple molecules.\n\n*   **Electrical Conductivity:** For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile charged particles (either delocalised electrons or mobile ions). In both diamond and silicon(IV) oxide, all the outer shell (valence) electrons are used to form strong covalent bonds. These electrons are localised between the atoms and are not free to move throughout the structure. Consequently, neither diamond nor silicon(IV) oxide can conduct electricity.\n\nTherefore, both substances are correctly described as non-conductors of electricity (\"no\") and having giant covalent structures.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly states that diamond and silicon(IV) oxide are conductors of electricity. Both substances are electrical insulators. Electrical conductivity requires the presence of mobile charge carriers, such as delocalised electrons. In the giant covalent structures of diamond and silicon(IV) oxide, all valence electrons are held firmly in covalent bonds and are not free to move. While the description of the structure as \"giant covalent\" is correct, the claim that they conduct electricity is false.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option contains two incorrect statements. Firstly, it claims that diamond and silicon(IV) oxide conduct electricity, which is false. They are electrical insulators because they lack delocalised electrons. Secondly, it incorrectly classifies their structure as \"simple covalent\". Simple covalent substances (like water or carbon dioxide) consist of small, discrete molecules with weak intermolecular forces, leading to low melting and boiling points. In contrast, diamond and silicon(IV) oxide have giant covalent structures with a network of strong covalent bonds, resulting in very high melting and boiling points.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly states that diamond and silicon(IV) oxide are not conductors of electricity. However, it incorrectly describes their structure as \"simple covalent\". Diamond and silicon(IV) oxide do not exist as small, individual molecules. Instead, they form giant covalent structures, where countless atoms are bonded together in a continuous three-dimensional lattice.

Magnesium chloride is an ionic compound with a very high melting point (714 \u00b0C). In this reaction, which occurs at or near room temperature, it will not be in a molten liquid state. Instead, as a soluble salt, it will be dissolved in the water, making its correct state aqueous (aq).\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because it identifies hydrochloric acid as a liquid (l) and water as aqueous (aq). \"Dilute hydrochloric acid\" is an aqueous solution (aq), not a pure liquid (l). Pure hydrogen chloride is a gas at room temperature. Furthermore, water (H\u2082O) as a product is represented by the state symbol (l) for liquid, as it is the substance in its pure liquid state.

Since each mole of Fe\u2082O\u2083 contains 5 moles of ions, the total moles of ions can be calculated as:\n    Total moles of ions = Moles of Fe\u2082O\u2083 \u00d7 (Number of ions per formula unit)\n    Total moles of ions = 0.25 mol \u00d7 5 = 1.25 mol of ions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of ions:** To find the actual number of ions, the moles of ions must be multiplied by Avogadro's constant (L), which is approximately 6.0 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 ions per mole.

The equation at the negative electrode is also incorrect; it shows the oxidation of oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b), which are not present, and oxidation occurs at the positive electrode.\n\n**C:** The reactions are assigned to the incorrect electrodes.

The blue colour of the solution fades.**\n\nThis statement is correct. In the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II) sulfate, the ions present in the solution are copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a), sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b), hydrogen ions (H\u207a), and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b).

The decrease in the concentration of these blue-coloured ions causes the overall colour of the solution to fade.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Bubbles of hydrogen gas are formed at the anode.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, hydrogen gas is produced from the reduction of hydrogen ions (H\u207a). As cations, H\u207a ions are attracted to the negative cathode, not the positive anode. Secondly, at the anode (the positive electrode), oxidation occurs. The anions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and OH\u207b) are attracted here. Hydroxide ions are more easily discharged than sulfate ions, leading to the formation of oxygen gas, not hydrogen gas.\n\n**B.

Copper is deposited at the anode.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The deposition of copper is a reduction process where positive copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) gain electrons. Reduction always occurs at the cathode (the negative electrode). The positively charged Cu\u00b2\u207a ions are attracted to the negatively charged cathode, where they are reduced to form neutral copper atoms (Cu).

It likely results from a miscalculation, such as using an incorrect number of bonds for one of the molecules or an arithmetic error during the calculation process. Correctly accounting for all bonds broken and formed is crucial for determining the accurate energy change.\n\n**C: +486 kJ/mol**\nThis value is incorrect. A positive energy change signifies an endothermic reaction, where more energy is absorbed than released. The correct calculation shows that the reaction is exothermic (\u0394H is negative). An error that can lead to a positive value is incorrectly reversing the formula, for example, by subtracting the energy of broken bonds from the energy of formed bonds (2810 - 2868 = +124 kJ/mol). While +486 kJ/mol is not the result of this specific common error, it represents an incorrect endothermic outcome.\n\n**D: +5496 kJ/mol**\nThis value is incorrect. It is obtained by adding the total energy of the bonds broken to the total energy of the bonds formed (2686 kJ/mol + 2810 kJ/mol = 5496 kJ/mol). This is a conceptual error.

The relationship is given by the formula pH = -log\u2081\u2080[H\u207a].\n\n1.  **pH of 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3 HBr:**\n    Hydrobromic acid (HBr) is a strong acid. Strong acids are defined as acids that fully dissociate (ionize) in aqueous solution. This means that essentially all the acid molecules break apart to release their hydrogen ions. Therefore, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H\u207a] will be equal to the initial concentration of the acid.\n    *   Concentration of HBr = 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3\n    *   Since it fully dissociates, [H\u207a] = 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3\n    *   The concentration 0.0100 can be expressed as 10\u207b\u00b2.\n    *   Calculating the pH: pH = -log\u2081\u2080(10\u207b\u00b2) = 2.\n    Thus, the pH of the HBr solution is 2.\n\n2.  **pH of 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3 trimethylethanoic acid:**\n    Acid strength is a measure of the extent to which an acid dissociates in solution. For acids of the same concentration, a stronger acid will dissociate more, producing a higher concentration of H\u207a ions and consequently a lower pH value. Conversely, a weaker acid will have a higher pH value.\n    *   The information provided states that ethanoic acid is a slightly stronger acid than trimethylethanoic acid.\n    *   The pH of a 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3 solution of ethanoic acid is given as 3.4.\n    *   Since trimethylethanoic acid is a weaker acid than ethanoic acid, its solution (at the same concentration) will have a lower [H\u207a] and therefore a pH value that is **greater than 3.4**.\n    *   Comparing the options, 3.5 is the only pH value greater than 3.4.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct pH values are 2 for HBr and 3.5 for trimethylethanoic acid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: pH of HBr = 2, pH of trimethylethanoic acid = 3.3\n\nThis option correctly identifies the pH of the strong acid HBr as 2. However, it incorrectly assigns a pH of 3.3 to trimethylethanoic acid. Since trimethylethanoic acid is weaker than ethanoic acid (pH 3.4), it must have a pH value *higher* than 3.4. A pH of 3.3 would imply it is a stronger acid than ethanoic acid, which contradicts the information given.\n\n#### C: pH of HBr = 3.4, pH of trimethylethanoic acid = 3.3\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the pH of the 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3 HBr solution is incorrect. As a strong acid, HBr fully dissociates, resulting in a pH of 2, not 3.4. A pH of 3.4 is characteristic of a weak acid at this concentration. Secondly, the pH of trimethylethanoic acid is incorrectly assigned as 3.3, which is lower than the pH of the stronger ethanoic acid (3.4), a contradiction of the principles of acid strength.\n\n#### D: pH of HBr = 3.4, pH of trimethylethanoic acid = 3.5\n\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the pH of the HBr solution. HBr is a strong acid and its 0.0100 mol/dm\u00b3 solution has a pH of 2, not 3.4. Although the pH value of 3.5 for trimethylethanoic acid is correctly reasoned (it is higher than the 3.4 pH of the stronger ethanoic acid), the incorrect pH for HBr makes the entire option invalid."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_336.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "16 anhydrous cobalt(ii) chloride is blue and turns pink when water is added.\nhow is this reaction reversed?\na__ adding dilute acid\nb filtering\ncheating\nd_ cooling", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C. heating**\n\nThe reaction described is the reversible hydration of anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride.

This process is called dehydration. Dehydration is an endothermic process, meaning it requires an input of energy to proceed. Heating the pink hydrated cobalt(II) chloride provides the necessary thermal energy to break the bonds holding the water molecules within the crystal lattice. The water evaporates, leaving behind the blue anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. adding dilute acid:** A dilute acid is an aqueous solution, which means it consists of an acid dissolved in water. Adding more water to the system would, according to Le Chatelier's principle for reversible reactions, shift the equilibrium position to favour the forward reaction. This would result in the formation of more pink hydrated cobalt(II) chloride, rather than reversing the reaction.\n\n**B. filtering:** Filtration is a physical separation technique used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. In hydrated cobalt(II) chloride, the water molecules are chemically bonded to the cobalt(II) chloride ions within the solid crystal lattice. Filtration is not capable of breaking chemical bonds and therefore cannot be used to separate the water of crystallisation from the salt.\n\n**D. cooling:** The forward reaction (hydration) is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. The reverse reaction (dehydration) is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature of a system at equilibrium is decreased (cooled), the equilibrium will shift in the direction of the exothermic reaction to counteract the change.

To relieve this stress, the equilibrium will shift to the side with the fewer number of moles of gas. In this case, the product side has 2 moles of gas, while the reactant side has 4 moles. Therefore, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of ammonia and thus increasing its yield.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. add a catalyst:**\nA catalyst increases the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions equally. It allows the system to reach equilibrium more quickly, but it does not change the position of the equilibrium itself. Therefore, adding a catalyst does not affect the final yield of ammonia.\n\n**C. increase the temperature:**\nThe problem states that the forward reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs heat to counteract this change. This means the endothermic (reverse) reaction will be favored. The equilibrium will shift to the left, causing ammonia to decompose back into nitrogen and hydrogen, thereby decreasing the yield of ammonia.\n\n**D. reduce the concentration of nitrogen:**\nNitrogen (N\u2082) is a reactant. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the concentration of a reactant is reduced, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change by producing more of that reactant.

Therefore, according to the definition of reduction as the loss of oxygen, silicon(IV) oxide has been reduced.\n\nAlternatively, we can analyse the change in oxidation states. In silicon(IV) oxide (SiO\u2082), oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. To balance the two oxygen atoms, silicon must have an oxidation state of +4. In the product, elemental silicon (Si) has an oxidation state of 0.

Weak acids, although they only partially dissociate in water, still produce hydrogen ions (H\u207a). These H\u207a ions react with a reactive metal like magnesium.

The two concepts are independent.\n\n**B) Weak acids dissociate fully in aqueous solution.**\nThis statement describes a strong acid, not a weak acid. By definition, a weak acid is a substance that only partially dissociates (or ionises) into its ions when dissolved in water.

Therefore, the element must have high electrical conductivity.\n\n2.  **Density:** Alkali metals are known for having unusually low densities compared to most other metals. The densities of the first three alkali metals (lithium, sodium, and potassium) are all less than the density of water (1.0 g/cm\u00b3). The density given in this option, 0.97 g/cm\u00b3, is the density of sodium (Na), which is in the same group as lithium.\n\nThis combination of high electrical conductivity and low density is characteristic of a Group 1 alkali metal.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile the high electrical conductivity is a correct property for a metal in Group 1, the density value is incorrect. Alkali metals are characterised by their low densities. A density of 8.93 g/cm\u00b3 is very high and is more typical of a transition metal, such as copper. The densities of Group 1 elements are all significantly lower than this value. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the element has low electrical conductivity. Lithium is in Group 1, the alkali metals. All metals are good conductors of electricity due to their delocalised electrons, which are mobile charge carriers. Therefore, any element in the same group as lithium must have high, not low, electrical conductivity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the element has low electrical conductivity. Elements in the same group as lithium are alkali metals. A defining characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct electricity well, which is described as high electrical conductivity. This is due to the presence of mobile delocalised electrons. Therefore, an element in Group 1 cannot have low electrical conductivity."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_344.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "24 the elements in group vii include chlorine, bromine and iodine.\nwhich statements are correct?\n1 lodine is more dense than chlorine.\n2 lodine displaces chlorine from a solution containing chloride ions.\n3 bromine is a diatomic non-metal.\n4 chlorine gas is darker in colour than bromine vapour.\na iand2 b 1and3 c 2and4 d 3and4", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct option is **B**, as statements 1 and 3 are correct.\n\n1.  **Iodine is more dense than chlorine.** This statement is correct. In Group VII (the halogens), density is a physical property that increases as you move down the group. This is due to the increase in atomic mass and the stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) between the molecules. Chlorine (Cl\u2082), in Period 3, is a gas at room temperature and pressure. Iodine (I\u2082), in Period 5, is a solid. The particles in a solid are packed much more closely together than in a gas, contributing to a significantly higher density.\n\n3.  **Bromine is a diatomic non-metal.** This statement is correct. The elements in Group VII are non-metals. In their elemental state, halogens exist as molecules containing two atoms joined by a single covalent bond. This is known as a diatomic molecule. Therefore, bromine exists as Br\u2082 molecules, making it a diatomic non-metal.\n\n### Explanation of the Incorrect Options\n\n**Option A (1 and 2):** Statement 2 is incorrect. The reactivity of halogens decreases down Group VII. A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen from a solution of its halide ions. Chlorine is higher up the group than iodine, making it more reactive. Therefore, chlorine can displace iodine from an iodide solution, but iodine cannot displace chlorine from a chloride solution.\n\n**Option C (2 and 4):** Both statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.\n*   As explained above, statement 2 is incorrect because iodine is less reactive than chlorine and cannot displace it.\n*   Statement 4, **Chlorine gas is darker in colour than bromine vapour**, is also incorrect. The colour of the halogens becomes progressively darker down the group. Chlorine gas is a pale, yellow-green colour, while bromine vapour is a dense, red-brown colour. Therefore, bromine vapour is darker than chlorine gas.\n\n**Option D (3 and 4):** Statement 4 is incorrect. As explained for option C, the colour of the halogens darkens down the group, making red-brown bromine vapour darker than pale green chlorine gas."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_345.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "25 cobalt is a transition element.\nwhat is a property of cobalt?\na_itcan form coloured compounds.\nblt is a poor electrical conductor.\nc_ithas a low density.\nd_ it has a low melting point.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nA key characteristic property of transition elements, including cobalt, is their ability to form coloured compounds. This phenomenon arises from the electronic structure of transition metal ions, which have partially filled d-orbitals. In a compound, these d-orbitals split into different energy levels. Electrons can absorb energy from visible light to move from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher one. The specific wavelengths of light that are absorbed depend on the metal ion and its chemical environment. The colour we perceive is the combination of the wavelengths of light that are not absorbed but are transmitted or reflected. For example, hydrated cobalt(II) ions, [Co(H\u2082O)\u2086]\u00b2\u207a, appear pink because they absorb light from the green part of the spectrum.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. It is a poor electrical conductor.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Cobalt is a transition metal. A defining property of metals is their excellent electrical conductivity. This is due to the structure of metals, which consists of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not bound to any single atom and are free to move throughout the structure. When a potential difference (voltage) is applied, these mobile electrons can flow and carry an electric current. Therefore, cobalt is a good electrical conductor, not a poor one.\n\n**C. It has a low density.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Transition elements are known for having high densities. Density is a measure of mass per unit volume. The atoms of transition metals like cobalt have a relatively high atomic mass and are packed closely and efficiently in a metallic lattice. This results in a large amount of mass occupying a small volume. Cobalt has a density of approximately 8.9 g/cm\u00b3, which is significantly higher than low-density metals like lithium (0.53 g/cm\u00b3) or sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3).\n\n**D. It has a low melting point.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Transition elements characteristically have high melting and boiling points. This is because of the strong metallic bonds that hold the atoms together in their giant metallic lattice. The strong electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the sea of delocalised electrons requires a large amount of thermal energy to overcome, resulting in high melting points. Cobalt has a high melting point of 1495 \u00b0C. In contrast, elements with low melting points include Group 1 metals (e.g., sodium at 98 \u00b0C) and many non-metals."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_346.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "26 which metal has variable oxidation numbers?\na aluminium\nb~ calcium\nc copper\nd_ sodium", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nCopper is a transition metal. A defining characteristic of transition metals is their ability to exhibit variable oxidation numbers (or oxidation states). This occurs because they can lose a different number of electrons from their outer electron shells to form stable positive ions. Copper, for example, commonly exists in two oxidation states: +1 (as the Cu\u207a ion, in compounds like copper(I) oxide, Cu\u2082O) and +2 (as the Cu\u00b2\u207a ion, in compounds like copper(II) sulfate, CuSO\u2084).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. aluminium**\nAluminium is a metal in Group 13 of the periodic table. Elements in this group consistently lose their three valence (outer shell) electrons to form a stable ion with a +3 charge. Therefore, aluminium has a fixed oxidation number of +3 in its compounds (e.g., Al\u00b3\u207a in Al\u2082O\u2083) and does not exhibit variable oxidation numbers.\n\n**B. calcium**\nCalcium is an alkaline earth metal, located in Group 2 of the periodic table. To achieve a stable electron configuration similar to a noble gas, calcium atoms always lose their two outermost electrons. This results in a fixed oxidation number of +2, forming the Ca\u00b2\u207a ion in all its compounds (e.g., CaCl\u2082).\n\n**D. sodium**\nSodium is an alkali metal in Group 1 of the periodic table. Like other Group 1 metals, it achieves stability by losing its single valence electron. Consequently, sodium has a fixed oxidation number of +1 and consistently forms the Na\u207a ion in its compounds (e.g., NaCl)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_347.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "27 which statement about alloys is correct?\na_ alloys are pure metal elements.\nb_ atleast two or more metals react together to make alloys.\nc_ alloys can be harder and stronger than a pure metal.\nd_ steel is not an alloy because it can contain the non-metal carbon.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of a metal with at least one other element. The addition of other elements disrupts the regular arrangement of atoms found in a pure metal. In a pure metal, the atoms are of the same size and are arranged in uniform layers. These layers can slide over one another relatively easily, which makes most pure metals soft and malleable. When atoms of a different element, which typically have a different size, are introduced into the metallic lattice, they distort the regular layered structure. This disruption makes it more difficult for the layers of atoms to slide, thereby increasing the material's hardness and strength. For example, pure iron is relatively soft, but when mixed with a small amount of carbon to form the alloy steel, it becomes significantly harder and stronger.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** This statement is incorrect. By definition, an alloy is a mixture of elements, with at least one being a metal. A pure metal element consists of only one type of atom (e.g., pure copper, Cu, or pure iron, Fe). Alloys, such as brass (a mixture of copper and zinc), are not pure elements.\n\n*   **B:** This statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, alloys are physical mixtures, not compounds formed through chemical reactions. The elements are typically melted together and then cooled to form a solid solution or mixture. Secondly, alloys do not have to be made exclusively of metals; they can also contain non-metals.\n\n*   **D:** This statement is incorrect. The definition of an alloy is a metallic substance composed of a mixture of a metal and at least one other element, which can be a metal or a non-metal. Steel is a primary example of an alloy, formed by mixing the metal iron with the non-metal carbon.

Metals from magnesium upwards are reactive enough to react with steam. A general reactivity series is: Potassium > Sodium > **[Metal M]** > Magnesium > Aluminium > Carbon > Zinc > Iron > Lead > Hydrogen > Copper. Since magnesium reacts with steam to produce magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas (Mg(s) + H\u2082O(g) \u2192 MgO(s) + H\u2082(g)), and metal M is more reactive than magnesium, M will also react with steam. Therefore, the statement 'M reacts with steam' is correct.\n\n2.  **Extraction from its Oxide:** The method used to extract a metal from its oxide depends on the metal's reactivity. Metals that are less reactive than carbon (e.g., zinc, iron, lead) can be extracted from their oxides by heating with carbon in a blast furnace. This is a reduction reaction where carbon displaces the metal. However, metals that are more reactive than carbon (e.g., potassium, sodium, magnesium, aluminium) cannot be extracted this way because carbon is not reactive enough to displace them. These metals are extracted by electrolysis of their molten compounds. Since metal M is between sodium and magnesium, it is significantly more reactive than carbon. Therefore, M cannot be extracted by heating its oxide with carbon. The statement 'M can be extracted by heating its oxide with carbon' is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, M does react with steam ('yes'), but it cannot be extracted from its oxide by heating with carbon ('no').\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because metal M will react with steam. M is placed between sodium and magnesium, making it a highly reactive metal. Magnesium reacts with steam, and since M is more reactive than magnesium, it will also react with steam.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, M will react with steam due to its high reactivity (more reactive than magnesium). Secondly, M cannot be extracted by heating its oxide with carbon. Because M is more reactive than carbon, carbon is not a strong enough reducing agent to displace M from its oxide.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because M cannot be extracted by heating its oxide with carbon.

This type of reaction is characteristic of alkanes, which are saturated hydrocarbons.\n\n3.  **It is a photochemical reaction:** This statement is also correct. A photochemical reaction is a chemical reaction that is initiated by the absorption of light energy. The reaction between alkanes and halogens, such as methane and chlorine, requires ultraviolet (UV) light, which is present in sunlight. The UV light provides the necessary energy to break the strong covalent bond in the chlorine molecule (Cl-Cl), initiating a free-radical chain reaction. Without this input of light energy, the reaction would not proceed under normal conditions.\n\nSince both statements 1 and 3 are correct descriptions of the reaction, this option is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B (1 and 4):** While statement 1 is correct, statement 4 is incorrect. The reaction is not catalysed by nickel. Nickel is a catalyst commonly used in hydrogenation reactions (the addition of hydrogen to unsaturated compounds like alkenes), not in the halogenation of alkanes. The energy required to start this reaction is supplied by sunlight, not by a chemical catalyst.\n\n*   **C (2 and 3):** While statement 3 is correct, statement 2 is incorrect. The reaction is not an addition reaction. Addition reactions involve the breaking of a double or triple bond in an unsaturated molecule, allowing new atoms to be added to the carbon chain without any atoms being removed. Methane is a saturated molecule (an alkane) with only single C-H and C-C bonds, so it cannot undergo addition reactions. Instead, it undergoes substitution, where a hydrogen atom is replaced.\n\n*   **D (2 and 4):** Both statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. As explained above, this reaction is a substitution, not an addition reaction (making statement 2 incorrect), and it is initiated by sunlight, not catalysed by nickel (making statement 4 incorrect)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_355.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "35 propene reacts with bromine to give one product only.\nwhat is the formula of the product?\na ch3ch2chbrz2\nb  ch2brch2ch,br\nc ch3chbrch,br\nd ch;ch2ch,br", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe reaction between propene and bromine is an example of an electrophilic addition reaction. Propene (CH\u2083CH=CH\u2082) is an alkene, characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond is a region of high electron density and is the site of the reaction.\n\nDuring the reaction, the pi-bond of the C=C double bond breaks. One bromine atom from the bromine molecule (Br\u2082) adds to each of the two carbon atoms that were part of the double bond.\n\n*   The structure of propene is CH\u2083\u2013CH=CH\u2082.\n*   The double bond is between the first and second carbon atoms.\n*   The bromine molecule (Br\u2082) adds across this double bond.\n*   The =CH group becomes a \u2013CHBr group.\n*   The =CH\u2082 group becomes a \u2013CH\u2082Br group.\n*   The CH\u2083\u2013 group is not involved in the reaction and remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is CH\u2083CHBrCH\u2082Br (1,2-dibromopropane).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. CH\u2083CH\u2082CHBr\u2082**\nThis formula represents 1,1-dibromopropane, where both bromine atoms are attached to the same carbon atom. This type of product (a geminal dihalide) is not formed from the addition of bromine (Br\u2082) to an alkene. The addition mechanism involves adding one bromine atom to each of the carbons of the double bond.\n\n**B. CH\u2082BrCH\u2082CH\u2082Br**\nThis formula represents 1,3-dibromopropane. This would imply that the bromine atoms have added to the first and third carbon atoms of the propane chain. The addition reaction of bromine specifically targets the electron-rich C=C double bond, which in propene is located between carbons 1 and 2. The saturated CH\u2083 group on carbon 3 does not participate in the addition reaction.\n\n**D. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082Br**\nThis formula represents 1-bromopropane. This molecule contains only one bromine atom. The reactant is a molecule of bromine (Br\u2082), which provides two bromine atoms to the reaction. Therefore, the product must be a dibromo-compound, containing two bromine atoms, not one.

In contrast, the catalytic addition of steam to ethene requires high temperatures (around 300 \u00b0C) and high pressures (60\u201370 atm). The lower temperature and pressure conditions of fermentation require significantly less energy, making it a less expensive process in terms of energy costs.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The ethanol is made from a renewable source.** Fermentation utilises sugars from plants like sugarcane or corn. These are renewable resources because they can be regrown. The alternative method uses ethene, which is produced by cracking hydrocarbons from crude oil, a finite and non-renewable fossil fuel. The use of a renewable feedstock is a major environmental and sustainability advantage.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A) 1 and 2\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 1 and 2 describe disadvantages of fermentation, not advantages.\n*   **Statement 1 (The yield of ethanol is low):** A low yield is a significant disadvantage as it means the process is less efficient in converting reactants to the desired product. Fermentation produces a relatively dilute aqueous solution of ethanol (up to about 15%), which then requires costly fractional distillation to purify.\n*   **Statement 2 (The method uses a batch process):** A batch process, where reactants are processed in discrete batches, is generally slower and less efficient for large-scale production than a continuous process. The hydration of ethene is a continuous process, which is faster and more economical for producing large quantities of ethanol.\n\n#### B) 1 and 3\nThis option is incorrect because, while statement 3 is an advantage, statement 1 is a disadvantage. A low yield of ethanol (statement 1) means that for a given amount of starting material, less product is obtained, which is economically and industrially unfavourable.

The ethanol molecule (C\u2082H\u2086O) loses two hydrogen atoms and gains one oxygen atom to become an ethanoic acid molecule (C\u2082H\u2084O\u2082). In organic chemistry, the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen is defined as oxidation. This reaction is typically carried out using a strong oxidizing agent, such as acidified potassium manganate(VII).\n\n**Reaction 2 is an ester formation reaction (esterification).** This reaction involves a carboxylic acid (ethanoic acid) reacting with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (like concentrated sulfuric acid). The hydroxyl (-OH) group from the carboxylic acid and a hydrogen atom from the alcohol's hydroxyl group are removed to form a molecule of water (H\u2082O). The remaining parts of the two molecules join to form an ester, in this case, ethyl ethanoate (CH\u2083COOC\u2082H\u2085). This specific type of reaction is called esterification, which is a condensation reaction that results in the formation of an ester.\n\nTherefore, row A correctly identifies reaction 1 as oxidation and reaction 2 as ester formation.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B) oxidation, addition**\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies reaction 2. While reaction 1 is correctly identified as oxidation, reaction 2 is not an addition reaction. An addition reaction involves breaking a double or triple bond within a molecule to add new atoms. In reaction 2, two molecules (ethanoic acid and ethanol) combine to form a larger molecule (ethyl ethanoate) and a small molecule (water) is eliminated.

The conversion of ethanol to ethanoic acid is an oxidation reaction, not a reduction. Reduction is the chemical process involving the loss of oxygen or the gain of hydrogen. Here, the ethanol molecule gains oxygen and loses hydrogen, which is the definition of oxidation. The reverse reaction, converting ethanoic acid back to ethanol, would be a reduction.\n\n**D) reduction, addition**\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies both reactions.

To obtain a specific fraction like fuel oil, the crude oil must be separated. This separation process is called fractional distillation, where the mixture is heated, and components are collected at different temperatures corresponding to their boiling points.\n*   **Stage 2: Cracking.** Fuel oil consists of long-chain saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes), which are not as useful for producing plastics. To produce ethene (a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon or alkene), these large molecules are broken down into smaller, more useful ones. This process, involving high temperatures and often a catalyst, is known as cracking.\n*   **Stage 3: Polymerisation.** Ethene is a small molecule called a monomer. To produce poly(ethene), a large polymer molecule, many ethene monomers must be joined together in a long chain. This chemical reaction is called addition polymerisation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: cracking, polymerisation, fractional distillation**\nThis option is incorrect. Stage 1 is fractional distillation, not cracking. Cracking is the breakdown of large molecules, whereas fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture. Stage 2 is cracking, not polymerisation; ethene is the monomer, which is then used in polymerisation. Stage 3 is polymerisation, not fractional distillation.\n\n**B: cracking, fractional distillation, polymerisation**\nThis option is incorrect. Stage 1 is fractional distillation, not cracking.

Since the substance is carried by the solvent, it cannot travel further than the solvent front itself. Consequently, the distance travelled by the substance is always less than or, at most, equal to the distance travelled by the solvent. This means the numerator of the fraction is always smaller than or equal to the denominator, resulting in an Rf value that is always less than or equal to 1.0.\n\n*   **Statement 3 is correct:** The Rf value is directly proportional to the distance the substance travels along the chromatogram.

The layers of metal ions can slide over each other.**\n\nMetals are described as having a giant metallic lattice structure. This structure consists of regular, ordered layers of positive metal ions (cations) surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. Malleability is the property of a substance that allows it to be hammered or pressed into different shapes without breaking.\n\nWhen an external force is applied to a metal, it is strong enough to cause the layers of positive ions to slip and slide over one another into new positions. The metallic structure does not shatter because the delocalised electrons are mobile and continue to surround the positive ions, maintaining the strong electrostatic attraction throughout the lattice. This non-directional bonding allows the metal to deform and change shape, which is the definition of malleability.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The electrons can move freely throughout the lattice.**\n\nThis statement is a correct description of the metallic structure, but it does not primarily explain malleability. The ability of electrons to move freely throughout the lattice makes them mobile charge carriers. This property is the reason why metals are good conductors of electricity and heat. While these delocalised electrons are essential for maintaining the metallic bond as layers slide, the act of the layers sliding (as described in option B) is the direct explanation for malleability.\n\n**C. The metal ions are positively charged.**\n\nWhile it is true that the particles in the metallic lattice are positively charged ions (cations), this fact alone does not explain malleability. For instance, ionic compounds also consist of charged ions. However, ionic lattices are brittle, not malleable. If a force is applied to an ionic crystal, the layers of ions shift, bringing ions with the same charge next to each other. The resulting repulsion between like charges causes the crystal to shatter. Therefore, the positive charge of the ions is a feature of the structure but not the reason for its malleability.\n\n**D. There is a strong force of attraction between the metal ions and the electrons.**\n\nThis statement describes the metallic bond itself. The strong electrostatic force of attraction between the positive metal ions and the sea of delocalised electrons is what holds the metal together, giving it high strength, high density, and high melting and boiling points. While this strong, non-directional attraction is what *allows* the layers to slide without breaking, the physical mechanism that defines malleability is the actual sliding of the layers.

Alternatively, if it contained a peroxide ion (O\u2082\u00b2\u207b), the iron would be iron(II) (Fe\u00b2\u207a).

It attracts positively charged ions (cations). Reduction, which is the gain of electrons, occurs at the cathode. In the electrolysis of many aqueous solutions (for example, dilute sulfuric acid or aqueous sodium chloride), hydrogen ions (H\u207a) from the dissociation of water molecules are attracted to the cathode. At the cathode, these hydrogen ions gain electrons and are reduced to form hydrogen gas (H\u2082). The half-equation for this reaction is: 2H\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 H\u2082(g). Therefore, it is correct that hydrogen gas forms at the cathode in some electrolysis reactions.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The anode is the positive electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) occurs. Copper typically exists as a positive ion, Cu\u00b2\u207a. As a cation, it is attracted to the negative cathode, not the positive anode. At the cathode, copper ions are reduced to form copper metal (Cu). In cases where an active copper anode is used (e.g., in copper refining), the copper anode itself is oxidised, dissolving into the electrolyte as Cu\u00b2\u207a ions. Thus, copper metal is deposited at the cathode, not the anode.\n\n**C:** Oxygen is formed at the anode (the positive electrode), not the cathode. During electrolysis of aqueous solutions containing hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) or in water itself, these species are attracted to the positive anode. They lose electrons (are oxidised) to form oxygen gas. The half-equation is 4OH\u207b(aq) \u2192 O\u2082(g) + 2H\u2082O(l) + 4e\u207b.

When copper electrodes are used, the anode gets smaller.**\n\nThis statement is correct. In the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II) sulfate with active copper electrodes, the anode is the site of oxidation. The copper metal of the anode itself is more easily oxidised than the hydroxide or sulfate ions present in the electrolyte. Therefore, copper atoms from the anode lose electrons and dissolve into the solution as copper(II) ions.\n\nThe half-equation for the reaction at the anode (positive electrode) is:\nCu(s) \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b\n\nAs the solid copper metal of the anode is converted into aqueous copper(II) ions, the anode loses mass and consequently gets smaller in size. This process is the basis for copper refining.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. When copper electrodes are used, the solution turns from blue to colourless.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The blue colour of the copper(II) sulfate solution is due to the presence of hydrated copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq)). When using copper electrodes:\n*   At the anode, copper metal dissolves to form Cu\u00b2\u207a ions: Cu(s) \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b.\n*   At the cathode, Cu\u00b2\u207a ions from the solution are deposited as copper metal: Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s).\n\nThe rate at which Cu\u00b2\u207a ions are formed at the anode is equal to the rate at which they are removed at the cathode. As a result, the concentration of Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) ions in the solution remains constant, and the blue colour of the solution does not change.\n\n**B. When graphite electrodes are used, bubbles of gas are formed at the cathode.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. When using inert graphite electrodes, the cathode (negative electrode) is the site of reduction. The positive ions present in the solution, copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) and hydrogen ions (H\u207a from the water), are attracted to the cathode. Since copper is less reactive than hydrogen, copper(II) ions are preferentially discharged (reduced).\n\nThe half-equation for the reaction at the cathode is:\nCu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s)\n\nA layer of solid pink-brown copper metal is deposited on the cathode.

When using inert graphite electrodes, copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) are removed from the solution at the cathode as they are reduced to form solid copper metal. The blue colour of the solution is caused by these Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) ions. As the electrolysis proceeds and the concentration of Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) ions decreases, the blue colour of the solution will fade, eventually becoming colourless.

While Le Chatelier's principle indicates that a low temperature would favor the forward reaction and produce a higher equilibrium yield of ammonia, the rate of reaction at low temperatures is impractically slow. To achieve a commercially viable rate of production, a compromise temperature (typically 400\u2013450 \u00b0C) is used. This temperature is high enough to make the reaction proceed quickly but not so high that it excessively reduces the equilibrium yield.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 2 (Correct):**\nThe balanced equation for the Haber process is N\u2082(g) + 3H\u2082(g) \u21cc 2NH\u2083(g). This shows that 4 moles of gaseous reactants produce 2 moles of gaseous product. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the pressure of a system at equilibrium is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. Therefore, applying a high pressure (typically 150\u2013250 atmospheres) favors the forward reaction, shifting the equilibrium to the right and increasing the equilibrium yield of ammonia.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**Explanation for Statement 3 (Incorrect):**\nThis statement is incorrect because the catalyst used in the Haber process is iron (Fe), not nickel (Ni). Nickel is used as a catalyst in other industrial reactions, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes to form alkanes or the hardening of vegetable oils to make margarine.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 4 (Incorrect):**\nThis statement correctly identifies iron as the catalyst but misrepresents its function. A catalyst increases the rate at which a reaction reaches equilibrium by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. It speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions equally. Consequently, a catalyst does not change the position of the equilibrium or the final equilibrium yield of the products; it only allows the equilibrium to be established more quickly."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_376.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "16 which substance is a raw material used to manufacture sulfuric acid?\na vanadium(v) oxide\nb \u00a9 sulfur\nc sulfur dioxide\nd \u00a9 sulfur trioxide", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe manufacture of sulfuric acid is carried out via the Contact process. The primary raw materials for this industrial process are sulfur, air (as a source of oxygen), and water. The first stage of the process involves burning molten sulfur in a supply of dry air to produce sulfur dioxide (S(l) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 SO\u2082(g)).

An intermediate is a substance that is formed in one step of a multi-step reaction and then consumed in a subsequent step. In this case, sulfur dioxide is produced in the first stage by burning the raw material, sulfur, in air. It is then used as a reactant in the second stage to produce sulfur trioxide.

Choice of Excess Reagent:**\nTo produce a *pure* sample of copper(II) sulfate, it is essential that one of the reactants is completely used up, and the excess reactant can be easily removed.\n\n*   The reactants are copper(II) carbonate (an insoluble solid) and sulfuric acid (an aqueous solution). The product, copper(II) sulfate, is soluble in water.\n*   If excess sulfuric acid were used, the final solution would contain both the desired copper(II) sulfate and the unreacted sulfuric acid. As both are soluble, separating them by a simple physical method like crystallisation is very difficult, leading to an impure product.\n*   By using excess copper(II) carbonate, all the sulfuric acid is guaranteed to react. The unreacted copper(II) carbonate, being an insoluble solid, can be easily and completely removed from the copper(II) sulfate solution by filtration. This leaves a pure solution of copper(II) sulfate, from which pure crystals can be obtained.\nTherefore, **copper(II) carbonate** must be the reagent in excess.\n\n**2. Method of Obtaining Crystals:**\nCopper(II) sulfate forms hydrated crystals (CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O), which contain water of crystallisation.

A key trend for physical properties in Group I is that the melting and boiling points decrease as you move down the group. This is because the atoms become larger, and the strength of the metallic bonding between the positive ions and the delocalised electrons weakens with increasing distance. Lithium is in Period 2, while potassium is further down in Period 4. Therefore, lithium has stronger metallic bonds and consequently a higher melting point (180.5 \u00b0C) than potassium (63.5 \u00b0C).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Bromine reacts with potassium chloride to produce chlorine.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes a halogen displacement reaction. The reactivity of the halogens (Group VII) decreases down the group. The order of reactivity is Fluorine > Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine. A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halide from its salt solution. Since chlorine is more reactive than bromine, bromine cannot displace chloride ions from potassium chloride. The reverse reaction (chlorine reacting with potassium bromide) would occur.\n\n**B. Iodine is a monatomic non-metal.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While iodine is a non-metal, it is not monatomic. Elements in Group VII, the halogens, exist as diatomic molecules, meaning they are formed of two atoms covalently bonded together (e.g., F\u2082, Cl\u2082, Br\u2082, I\u2082). Monatomic elements, such as the noble gases in Group 0 (e.g., He, Ne, Ar), exist as single, unbonded atoms.\n\n**D. Sodium is more reactive with water than potassium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of the alkali metals (Group I) increases as you move down the group. This is because the outermost electron is further from the nucleus and is more easily lost due to increased atomic radius and greater electron shielding. Potassium is below sodium in Group I, making it more reactive.

At standard room temperature (around 25 \u00b0C), this element is a liquid, as this temperature is above its melting point but below its boiling point. Bromine is the only halogen that is a liquid at room temperature. The melting and boiling points of elements in Group VII increase down the group. This trend is due to the increasing strength of the intermolecular van der Waals forces as the number of electrons in the diatomic molecules (F\u2082, Cl\u2082, Br\u2082, I\u2082) increases. The given values are consistent with the known physical properties of bromine (melting point: -7.2 \u00b0C; boiling point: 58.8 \u00b0C).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. fluorine**\nFluorine is a gas at room temperature. As the first element in Group VII, its molecules (F\u2082) have the fewest electrons, resulting in the weakest van der Waals forces of all the halogens. Consequently, it has very low melting and boiling points (melting point: -220 \u00b0C; boiling point: -188 \u00b0C), which are significantly lower than the values provided.\n\n**B. chlorine**\nChlorine is a gas at room temperature. It is the second element in Group VII, so its melting and boiling points are higher than those of fluorine but lower than those of bromine. The actual melting point of chlorine is -101 \u00b0C and its boiling point is -34 \u00b0C. These values are considerably lower than the -7 \u00b0C and 59 \u00b0C given.\n\n**D. iodine**\nIodine is a solid at room temperature. It is located below bromine in Group VII, so its diatomic molecules (I\u2082) have more electrons and stronger van der Waals forces. This results in significantly higher melting and boiling points compared to bromine. The melting point of iodine is 114 \u00b0C and its boiling point is 184 \u00b0C, both of which are much higher than the values provided."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_382.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "22 manganese(iv) oxide, mnoz, is a black solid.\nthe equation for the reaction between manganese(iv) oxide and dilute hydrochloric acid is\nshown.\nmnoz + 4hcl > mncl2z + 2h20 + cl,\nthe reaction produces a pale pink solution.\nwhich properties of transition elements does this reaction show?\n1 they can act as catalysts.\n2 they form coloured compounds.\n3. they have high melting points.\n4 they have variable oxidation numbers.\na iand3 b 1and4 c 2and3 d 2and4", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D (2 and 4)\n\nThe reaction demonstrates two key properties of transition elements: the formation of coloured compounds and the existence of variable oxidation numbers.\n\n*   **Property 2: They form coloured compounds.**\n    The problem states that manganese(IV) oxide (MnO\u2082) is a black solid.

Steel is an alloy composed mainly of iron. This protection method involves connecting the steel to a more reactive metal.\n\nAccording to the reactivity series of metals, a more reactive metal has a greater tendency to lose electrons (be oxidised) than a less reactive metal. When steel (iron) is in electrical contact with a more reactive metal in the presence of an electrolyte (like seawater), an electrochemical cell is formed. The more reactive metal acts as the anode and is preferentially oxidised, corroding away over time. The steel acts as the cathode and is protected from oxidation (rusting).\n\nZinc is higher than iron in the reactivity series, meaning it is more reactive.

Both of these properties are essential for its use in manufacturing and functioning as electrical wiring.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While aluminium is used for aircraft construction and is resistant to corrosion (due to the formation of a protective aluminium oxide layer), it does not have a high density.

Anions (negatively charged ions) from the electrolyte are attracted to the anode, where they undergo oxidation (loss of electrons). In the electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083), the electrolyte contains oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) and aluminium ions (Al\u00b3\u207a). The negative oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) migrate to the positive carbon anode. At the anode, each oxide ion loses two electrons. Two oxide ions react to form one molecule of diatomic oxygen gas (O\u2082), losing a total of four electrons in the process.

Al\u00b3\u207a \u2192 Al + 3e\u207b**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because it describes the oxidation of an aluminium ion (Al\u00b3\u207a). As a cation (a positively charged ion), Al\u00b3\u207a would be attracted to the negatively charged cathode, not the positively charged anode. Oxidation does occur at the anode, but it is the anion (O\u00b2\u207b) that is oxidised, not the cation (Al\u00b3\u207a).\n\n**D. Al\u00b3\u207a + 3e\u207b \u2192 Al**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because it represents the reaction that occurs at the cathode, not the anode. The cathode is the negative electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) takes place. Positive aluminium ions (Al\u00b3\u207a) are attracted to the cathode, where they gain three electrons each to form neutral molten aluminium atoms (Al).

This conversion is a redox reaction. Reduction can be defined as the loss of oxygen or a decrease in oxidation state. In this process, the nitrogen atom in an oxide of nitrogen loses its oxygen atoms to form diatomic nitrogen gas (N\u2082). For example, in the reaction `2NO(g) + 2CO(g) \u2192 N\u2082(g) + 2CO\u2082(g)`, the nitrogen in NO (oxidation state +2) is converted to N\u2082 (oxidation state 0). Since the oxidation state of nitrogen decreases, the oxides of nitrogen are said to be reduced.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: They are hydrated.**\nHydration is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with water. This process does not occur with oxides of nitrogen in a catalytic converter. The purpose of the converter is to break down harmful pollutants into less harmful substances, not to add water to them.\n\n**B: They are neutralised.**\nNeutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base. While oxides of nitrogen are acidic oxides (they can react with water to form acids), they are not removed by a neutralisation reaction within the catalytic converter. The process is a catalytic redox reaction, not an acid-base reaction.\n\n**C: They are oxidised.**\nOxidation is the gain of oxygen or an increase in oxidation state. In the catalytic converter, oxides of nitrogen are converted to nitrogen gas (N\u2082), which involves the *loss* of oxygen. The oxidation state of nitrogen decreases (e.g., from +2 in NO to 0 in N\u2082). Therefore, the oxides of nitrogen are reduced, not oxidised. In fact, they act as the oxidising agent, causing the oxidation of other pollutants like carbon monoxide."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_388.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "28 what is the equation for photosynthesis?\na 6coz + 6h20 - cehi20\u00a2 + 602\nb 2coz + 2h20 - 2c2hs0h + 302\nc cehi206 > 2coz + 2c2h50h\nd c,hso0h + 302 + 2co2 + 3h20", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nPhotosynthesis is the endothermic chemical process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy.

For example, there are 2 carbon atoms on the reactant side but 4 on the product side.

The correct option identifies two of these defining features.\n\n*   **Statement 3: They have the same functional group.** This is a fundamental characteristic of a homologous series. The functional group is an atom or group of atoms that determines the chemical properties of a molecule. All members of a given homologous series possess the same functional group. For example, every member of the alcohol series contains the hydroxyl (-OH) functional group.\n*   **Statement 4: They have the same general formula.** This is also a defining characteristic. A general formula is an algebraic expression that describes the composition of any member of the series. For instance, all alkanes fit the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082, and all alkenes fit the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099.\n\nSince both statements 3 and 4 are correct definitions of a homologous series, option D is the correct answer.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A) 1 and 2\n\nThis option is incorrect because both statements are false descriptions of a homologous series.\n*   **Statement 1 (They have the same volatility):** Volatility refers to how easily a substance vaporizes. As you move down a homologous series, the carbon chain length and molar mass increase. This results in stronger intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces) between molecules. Stronger forces require more energy to overcome, leading to higher boiling points and therefore, a gradual decrease in volatility.\n*   **Statement 2 (They have the same molecular formula):** By definition, successive members of a homologous series differ by a CH\u2082 group. This means each member has a different molecular formula. For example, methane (CH\u2084) and ethane (C\u2082H\u2086) are the first two members of the alkane series and have distinct molecular formulas.\n\n#### B) 1 and 4\n\nThis option is incorrect because statement 1 is false.\n*   **Statement 1 (They have the same volatility):** This is incorrect. Physical properties like volatility show a gradual trend within a homologous series.

This double bond makes ethene an unsaturated compound, not a saturated one.\n\n**B) Ethene: saturated, Ethanol: unsaturated**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Ethene (C\u2082H\u2084) is unsaturated due to its C=C double bond. Ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) is saturated because it contains only C-C single bonds in its carbon chain.

The process involves heating the long-chain alkanes to high temperatures (e.g., 600\u2013700\u00b0C) in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., aluminium oxide or silicon dioxide). This causes the strong C-C and C-H bonds to break, resulting in the formation of at least one smaller-chain alkane and one alkene. For example, the cracking of decane (C\u2081\u2080H\u2082\u2082) can produce octane (C\u2088H\u2081\u2088) and ethene (C\u2082H\u2084). This process is vital in the petrochemical industry to meet the high demand for petrol (a mixture of smaller alkanes) and alkenes, which are used as feedstock for producing polymers and other chemicals.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. combustion**\nCombustion is the chemical process of burning a substance in the presence of an oxidant, typically oxygen, to release energy in the form of heat and light. The complete combustion of a hydrocarbon, such as a long-chain alkane, yields carbon dioxide and water as products. Incomplete combustion, which occurs with insufficient oxygen, produces carbon monoxide and/or carbon (soot) and water. Combustion does not produce alkenes; it is a process for energy generation from fuels.\n\n**B. condensation**\nA condensation reaction is one in which two or more molecules combine to form a single, larger molecule, along with the elimination of a small molecule like water or ammonia. This is a process of building up larger molecules from smaller units (e.g., the formation of an ester from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol). It is not a process that breaks down a large molecule like a long-chain alkane into smaller ones.\n\n**D. polymerisation**\nPolymerisation is a process in which small molecules, called monomers, join together to form a very large molecule, known as a polymer. Specifically, addition polymerisation involves alkene monomers reacting to form a long, saturated polymer chain. For instance, ethene (an alkene) polymerises to form poly(ethene). This process is the opposite of cracking; it uses alkenes to create long-chain molecules, rather than breaking down long-chain molecules to create alkenes."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_392.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "32 which fraction obtained from petroleum has the lowest boiling point?\na diesel oil\nb fuel oil\nc_ kerosene\nd_ naphtha", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. naphtha\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe separation of petroleum into different fractions is achieved through fractional distillation, a process that separates liquids based on their boiling points. The boiling point of a hydrocarbon fraction is determined by the size of its constituent molecules.\n\nNaphtha consists of hydrocarbon molecules with relatively short carbon chains (typically C6-C11). Smaller molecules have weaker intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces) between them. Consequently, less energy is required to overcome these forces and turn the liquid into a gas. This results in a lower boiling point compared to fractions with larger molecules. Among the options provided, naphtha has the shortest hydrocarbon chains and therefore the lowest boiling point.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. diesel oil**\nDiesel oil is composed of hydrocarbon molecules that are significantly larger (longer carbon chains, typically C15-C19) than those found in naphtha. The increased size of these molecules leads to stronger intermolecular forces. More energy is needed to overcome these stronger forces, resulting in a much higher boiling point than naphtha.\n\n**B. fuel oil**\nFuel oil consists of some of the largest hydrocarbon molecules (very long carbon chains, typically C20 and above) obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum. These large molecules have very strong intermolecular forces, giving fuel oil a very high boiling point, which is higher than that of diesel oil, kerosene, and naphtha. It is collected at a lower, hotter level in the fractionating column.\n\n**C. kerosene**\nKerosene contains hydrocarbon molecules with medium-length carbon chains (typically C11-C16). These molecules are larger than those in naphtha but smaller than those in diesel oil. As a result, the intermolecular forces in kerosene are stronger than in naphtha but weaker than in diesel oil.

In this reaction, the alcohol functional group (-OH) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This specific transformation can be achieved through the action of microorganisms, particularly bacteria of the genus *Acetobacter*. In the presence of oxygen, these bacteria use enzymes to catalyse the oxidation of ethanol to ethanoic acid. This biological process is known as bacterial oxidation and is the method used to produce vinegar from alcoholic solutions like wine or cider.

Fermentation:** Fermentation is an anaerobic process (occurring without oxygen) where microorganisms, such as yeast, break down sugars (like glucose) into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is used to produce alcoholic beverages and bio-ethanol. Fermentation *produces* ethanol, the reactant in the question, rather than converting it into ethanoic acid.\n\n**C. Catalytic addition of steam:** This process, also known as hydration, involves adding water (in the form of steam) across the double bond of an alkene in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., phosphoric acid).

When a soluble impurity is dissolved in water, the solute particles occupy space at the liquid's surface and exert attractive forces on the water molecules. This reduces the number of water molecules that can escape into the vapor phase at any given temperature, thus lowering the water's vapor pressure. To make the solution boil, more energy (a higher temperature) is required to increase the vapor pressure to match the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the boiling point of the solution is higher than that of pure water.\n\n2.  **Melting Point Depression:** The melting point (or freezing point) is the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a substance are in equilibrium. For water to freeze into ice, its molecules must arrange themselves into a highly ordered crystalline lattice. The presence of solute particles disrupts this process, interfering with the formation of the crystal structure. To overcome this disruption and allow the ice lattice to form, the kinetic energy of the molecules must be reduced further, which requires a lower temperature. Consequently, the melting/freezing point of the solution is lower than that of pure water.\n\nTherefore, adding a soluble impurity increases the boiling point and decreases the melting point of water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option correctly states that the boiling point increases but incorrectly states that the melting point also increases. The presence of a soluble impurity causes **melting point depression**, not elevation. The solute particles interfere with the formation of the ordered crystal structure of ice, making it more difficult for the water to freeze. This requires the temperature to be lowered to a point below the normal melting point of pure water (0\u00b0C) for freezing to occur. Thus, the melting point decreases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly states that the melting point decreases but incorrectly states that the boiling point also decreases. The presence of a soluble impurity causes **boiling point elevation**, not depression. The solute particles lower the vapor pressure of the water. Since boiling occurs when the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, a higher temperature is needed to supply enough energy to raise the lowered vapor pressure to the required level.

As the temperature of the gas is kept constant, the average kinetic energy of the gas particles remains unchanged. Since the kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its speed (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2), the average speed of the gas particles does not change.\n\nAccording to the gas laws (specifically Boyle's Law), for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume (P \u221d 1/V). Therefore, if the pressure of the gas is decreased, its volume must increase.\n\nAn increase in volume means the particles are, on average, further apart from one another. As the particles are now moving at the same average speed but within a larger space, they will collide with each other and with the walls of the container less frequently. Thus, the collisions occur less often.\n\nTherefore, there is no change in the speed of the particles, and the collisions between them occur less often.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A:** This option is incorrect because the speed of the particles would only decrease if the temperature decreased. The problem states that the temperature is kept constant, so the average speed of the particles does not change.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the speed of the particles remains constant because the temperature is constant. Secondly, the force of individual collisions depends on the kinetic energy of the particles. Since the kinetic energy is constant, the average force of each collision does not change. Pressure decreases because the *frequency* of collisions decreases, not because the force of each collision changes.\n\n*   **D:** This option correctly states that there is no change in the speed of the particles. However, it incorrectly states that collisions occur with more force. The average force of an individual collision is determined by the kinetic energy of the particles, which remains constant because the temperature is constant.

These electrons are involved in forming chemical bonds and participating in chemical reactions. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Therefore, both isotopes of rubidium (\u2078\u2075Rb and \u2078\u2077Rb) have 37 protons and, when neutral, 37 electrons.

They have the same number of protons.**\nWhile it is true that both isotopes have the same number of protons (37), this is not the most direct explanation for their identical chemical properties. The number of protons defines the element and determines the nuclear charge, which in turn dictates the number of electrons in a neutral atom. However, it is the resulting arrangement of these electrons (the electronic configuration) that directly governs chemical reactivity.

Rubidium-85 has 48 neutrons (85 - 37), and rubidium-87 has 50 neutrons (87 - 37). However, this explains what makes them *different*, not why their chemical properties are the *same*. Neutrons are in the nucleus and do not participate in chemical bonding. The difference in neutron number affects physical properties like atomic mass and nuclear stability, but not chemical behaviour.\n\n**D. They have different mass numbers.**\nThis statement is also true and is a direct consequence of the different numbers of neutrons. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons (85 for one isotope and 87 for the other). This difference leads to variations in physical properties such as density and rate of diffusion.

This can be determined by considering the valence electrons of each atom and the octet rule.\n\n1.  **Valence Electrons:** Carbon (C) is in Group 14 of the Periodic Table and has 4 valence electrons. Oxygen (O) is in Group 16 and has 6 valence electrons.\n2.  **Octet Rule:** To achieve a stable electron configuration, atoms tend to form covalent bonds to obtain a full outer shell of 8 electrons (an octet). Carbon needs to form 4 covalent bonds to share 4 additional electrons. Each oxygen atom needs to form 2 covalent bonds to share 2 additional electrons.\n3.  **Bond Formation:** In CO\u2082, the central carbon atom forms a double covalent bond with each of the two oxygen atoms. A double bond involves the sharing of two pairs of electrons (four electrons in total).\n4.  **Stability:** This arrangement allows the carbon atom to form a total of four bonds (2 double bonds), satisfying its need. Each oxygen atom forms one double bond (two bonds), satisfying its requirement. In this structure, the carbon atom shares a total of 8 electrons, and each oxygen atom also has 8 electrons in its valence shell (4 shared in the double bond and 4 as non-bonding lone pair electrons), fulfilling the octet rule for all atoms and creating a stable molecule.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (A)\n\nThe structure O-C-O is incorrect because it does not satisfy the octet rule for either the carbon or the oxygen atoms. In this diagram, the carbon atom forms only two single covalent bonds. This means it only shares two pairs of electrons, resulting in a total of only 4 electrons in its outer shell, which is far from the stable octet of 8. Similarly, each oxygen atom forms only one single bond, giving it a total of 7 valence electrons (6 of its own plus 1 from the bond). This is also an unstable configuration. For a stable molecule to form, all atoms must typically achieve a full outer shell of electrons.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (B)\n\nThe structure O=C-O is incorrect because it results in an unstable configuration for the central carbon atom. In this asymmetrical arrangement, the carbon atom forms one double bond and one single bond, for a total of three covalent bonds. This provides the carbon atom with only 6 shared electrons, failing to satisfy the octet rule which requires 8 electrons for maximum stability. Although the oxygen atoms could potentially satisfy their octets in this arrangement (with appropriate lone pairs), the instability of the central carbon atom with its incomplete octet makes this bonding model incorrect for carbon dioxide.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (D)\n\nThe structure O\u2261C\u2261O is incorrect because it violates the octet rule for the carbon atom. This diagram shows the carbon atom forming two triple bonds. A triple bond involves the sharing of three pairs of electrons (six electrons). If carbon formed two triple bonds, it would be surrounded by a total of 12 shared electrons. This exceeds the stable octet of 8 electrons that second-period elements like carbon can accommodate in their valence shell.

Within each molecule, sulfur and chlorine atoms are joined by strong covalent bonds. However, in the solid state, the individual SCl\u2082 molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). To melt sulfur dichloride, only these weak intermolecular forces need to be overcome.

It consists of a vast, regular arrangement of positive sodium ions (Na\u207a) and negative chloride ions (Cl\u207b).

Firstly, sodium chloride is a giant ionic lattice and does not consist of molecules; the attractive forces are strong ionic bonds between ions. Secondly, the melting of sulfur dichloride does not involve the breaking of the strong covalent bonds *within* the molecules, but rather the overcoming of the weak intermolecular forces *between* the molecules.\n\n**B: The covalent bonds in sulfur dichloride are weaker than the ionic bonds in sodium chloride.**\nThis comparison is irrelevant to the question of melting point. When a simple molecular substance like sulfur dichloride melts, the strong covalent bonds within the molecules are not broken.

Graphite consists of flat, two-dimensional layers of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal rings. Within each layer, the carbon atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds. However, the forces between these parallel layers are weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). Because these forces are weak, the layers can easily slide over one another.

When a force is applied to a metal, the layers of positive ions can slide over one another into new positions. The delocalised electrons are mobile and move with the ions, maintaining the electrostatic attraction (the metallic bond) between the positive ions and the electrons. This prevents the structure from shattering, which would happen in an ionic compound where repulsion would occur between like-charged ions if the layers were to shift. Therefore, the ability of rows of positive ions to slide over each other explains malleability.\n\n*   **Electrical Conductivity:** This is the ability of a substance to conduct an electric current. An electric current is a flow of charge. In a solid metal, the positive ions are fixed in the lattice and can only vibrate. However, the delocalised electrons are not bound to any single ion and are free to move throughout the entire structure. When a voltage is applied across the metal, these mobile electrons are attracted towards the positive terminal, and their movement constitutes an electric current. Therefore, the presence of mobile delocalised electrons explains electrical conductivity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The explanation for malleability is incorrect. While the delocalised electrons are essential for malleability (as they maintain the metallic bond), the direct mechanical reason is the sliding of the layers of positive ions. The statement \"Delocalised electrons can move freely\" is the correct explanation for electrical conductivity, not malleability.\n\n**B:** The explanation for malleability is incorrect, as it describes the reason for electrical conductivity. The explanation for electrical conductivity is also incorrect. In a *solid* metal, the positive ions are held in fixed positions within the lattice and are not free to move. Therefore, they cannot act as charge carriers to conduct electricity.\n\n**D:** The explanation for malleability is correct. However, the explanation for electrical conductivity is incorrect. In a solid metal, the positive ions are immobile and fixed in the lattice structure. Only the delocalised electrons are free to move and carry an electric current.

It is double the correct value. This error could arise from using an incorrect value for the molar volume of a gas at r.t.p., specifically half the correct value (12,000 cm\u00b3/mol instead of 24,000 cm\u00b3/mol). This would lead to a calculated value of 0.03 moles of total gas, which in turn gives 0.01 moles of ammonium carbonate, resulting in a final mass of 0.96 g (0.01 mol \u00d7 96 g/mol).\n\n#### D: 1.44 g\nThis answer is incorrect. This result is obtained by making a common error in interpreting the stoichiometry. It arises from incorrectly assuming that the total volume of gas (360 cm\u00b3) is produced by only one of the gaseous products, specifically CO\u2082. This would imply a 1:1 mole ratio between the reactant and the gas.

The energy released when the activated complex forms the products is given as -342 kJ/mol. The overall enthalpy change is the sum of these two values.\n\n\u0394H = (Activation Energy) + (Energy released from transition state)\n\u0394H = (+250 kJ/mol) + (-342 kJ/mol)\n\u0394H = -92 kJ/mol\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, meaning that overall energy is released.

Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for reactant particles to have a successful collision that leads to the formation of products. If the catalyst is removed, the reaction must proceed via the original, uncatalysed pathway, which has a significantly higher activation energy. Consequently, a smaller proportion of collisions will have sufficient energy to overcome this higher energy barrier, resulting in a lower rate of reaction. Therefore, removing the catalyst lowers the reaction rate because the activation energy is higher.\n\n### Explanation of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. Higher Pressure**\nWhile increasing the pressure of a gaseous reaction does increase the reaction rate, the explanation provided is incorrect. The rate increases because a higher pressure forces the gas particles closer together, increasing their concentration (the number of particles per unit volume). This leads to a greater frequency of collisions between reactant particles, which in turn increases the frequency of successful collisions. The average kinetic energy of the particles is primarily determined by temperature, not pressure. Therefore, the statement that \"the particles have more kinetic energy\" is an incorrect explanation for the effect of pressure.\n\n**C. Lower Temperature**\nLowering the temperature decreases the reaction rate, so the \"effect on rate\" is correctly identified as \"lower\". However, the explanation is incorrect. Lowering the temperature reduces the average kinetic energy of the reactant particles. This means the particles move more slowly, leading to a decrease in the frequency of collisions. Therefore, the statement that \"the particles collide more frequently\" is incorrect; they collide less frequently. Additionally, fewer particles will possess the required activation energy, further reducing the rate.\n\n**D. Lower Pressure**\nLowering the pressure of a gaseous reaction decreases the concentration of reactant particles (fewer particles per unit volume). This leads to less frequent collisions between particles, and consequently, a lower rate of reaction. This option incorrectly states that a lower pressure leads to a higher rate.

An oxidising agent is a substance that causes another substance to be oxidised, and is itself reduced. A reducing agent is a substance that causes another substance to be reduced, and is itself oxidised.\n\n1.  **Role of iron(II) sulfate:**\n    In the first reaction, aqueous iron(II) sulfate is added to acidified potassium manganate(VII). The purple manganate(VII) ion (MnO\u2084\u207b), where manganese has an oxidation state of +7, is a strong oxidising agent. It is reduced to the colourless manganese(II) ion (Mn\u00b2\u207a), where manganese has an oxidation state of +2. For this reduction to occur, the iron(II) sulfate must be oxidised. The iron(II) ion (Fe\u00b2\u207a) is oxidised to the iron(III) ion (Fe\u00b3\u207a), meaning its oxidation state increases from +2 to +3. Since iron(II) sulfate causes the reduction of potassium manganate(VII), it acts as a **reducing agent**.\n\n2.  **Role of potassium dichromate(VI):**\n    In the second reaction, aqueous potassium iodide is added to acidified potassium dichromate(VI). The dichromate(VI) ion (Cr\u2082O\u2087\u00b2\u207b), where chromium has an oxidation state of +6, is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the iodide ions (I\u207b, oxidation state -1) from potassium iodide to iodine molecules (I\u2082, oxidation state 0), which forms the observed dark brown solution. In this process, the dichromate(VI) ion is itself reduced to the chromium(III) ion (Cr\u00b3\u207a), where chromium has an oxidation state of +3. Because potassium dichromate(VI) causes the oxidation of potassium iodide, it acts as an **oxidising agent**.\n\nTherefore, iron(II) sulfate is a reducing agent, and potassium dichromate(VI) is an oxidising agent.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because iron(II) sulfate acts as a reducing agent, not an oxidising agent.

This means that virtually every molecule of the acid breaks apart to release its hydrogen ions (H\u207a). For example, in a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl), almost all the HCl molecules ionize to form H\u207a and Cl\u207b ions.\n    HCl(aq) \u2192 H\u207a(aq) + Cl\u207b(aq)\n\n*   A **weak acid** is defined as an acid that only partially dissociates in water. This is a reversible reaction, and an equilibrium is established where only a small fraction of the acid molecules have released their hydrogen ions. Most of the acid remains as undissociated molecules. For example, in a solution of ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH), an equilibrium exists between the undissociated molecules and the ions.\n    CH\u2083COOH(aq) \u21cc H\u207a(aq) + CH\u2083COO\u207b(aq)\n\nTherefore, row D correctly identifies that a weak acid is partially dissociated, while a strong acid is fully dissociated.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A: fully dissociated / partially dissociated**\n    This option incorrectly reverses the definitions. Strong acids are the ones that fully dissociate in water, leading to a high concentration of H\u207a ions for a given molarity. Weak acids are the ones that only partially dissociate, resulting in a lower concentration of H\u207a ions.\n\n*   **B: concentrated / dilute**\n    This option incorrectly conflates the concepts of acid strength and concentration.\n    *   **Strength** (strong vs. weak) is an intrinsic property of an acid that describes its degree of dissociation.\n    *   **Concentration** (concentrated vs. dilute) describes the amount of acid solute dissolved in a specific volume of solvent.\n    It is possible to have a concentrated solution of a weak acid (e.g., 10 M ethanoic acid) and a dilute solution of a strong acid (e.g., 0.1 M hydrochloric acid). Therefore, concentration is not the defining difference between a weak and a strong acid.\n\n*   **C: dilute / concentrated**\n    Similar to option B, this option incorrectly uses concentration to define acid strength. An acid's classification as strong or weak is independent of its concentration. A strong acid remains strong whether it is in a concentrated or dilute solution, and a weak acid remains weak regardless of its concentration. The defining characteristic is always the extent to which the acid molecules dissociate in water."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_420.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "20 which substance turns methyl orange red?\na aqueous ammonia\nb_ dilute hydrochloric acid\nc aqueous sodium hydroxide\nd distilled water", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMethyl orange is an acid-base indicator. It appears red in strongly acidic solutions (pH below 3.1), yellow in alkaline solutions (pH above 4.4), and orange in neutral or weakly acidic solutions. Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, meaning it fully dissociates in water to produce a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H\u207a). This results in a solution with a low pH (typically less than 3.1), causing the methyl orange indicator to turn red.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. aqueous ammonia**\n\nAqueous ammonia (NH\u2083(aq)) is a weak alkali. It partially ionises in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH\u207b), resulting in a solution with a pH greater than 7. In alkaline conditions (pH > 4.4), methyl orange turns yellow.

Calcium oxide is a basic oxide, not an acidic one, as it is a metal oxide that neutralises acids.

Their ability to exist in variable oxidation states allows them to facilitate chemical reactions. Therefore, 'yes' is correct.\n2.  **Colour of oxide:** Transition elements typically form coloured compounds, including their oxides. This is due to the presence of partially filled d-orbitals, which allows for electron transitions that absorb specific wavelengths of visible light. For example, iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) is red-brown. Therefore, 'red' is a valid colour for a transition element oxide.\n3.  **Electrical conductivity:** Transition elements are metals. Like all metals, they have a structure consisting of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These mobile electrons are free to move and carry charge, making transition elements good conductors of electricity.

Elements in this region are classified as non-metals. Non-metals typically have low melting and boiling points, are poor conductors of heat and electricity, and are brittle in their solid state. Fluorine, as the first member of the halogen group, is a classic example of a non-metallic element.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) It is inert.**\nThis statement is incorrect. 'Inert' means chemically unreactive. This property is characteristic of the noble gases in Group 0 (or VIII), which have a full outer shell of electrons. Fluorine is in Group VII and has seven valence electrons. It is highly reactive as it readily gains one electron to achieve a stable, full outer shell. Fluorine is, in fact, the most electronegative and most reactive element.\n\n**B) It is monatomic.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Monatomic elements exist as single, unbonded atoms. The noble gases (Group 0) are monatomic because their full outer shells make them stable. Fluorine, with seven outer electrons, is unstable as a single atom. To achieve stability, two fluorine atoms each share one electron with the other, forming a single covalent bond. This results in the formation of a stable diatomic molecule (F\u2082).\n\n**D) It is a solid at room temperature.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The physical states of the halogens change down Group VII. Fluorine is a pale yellow gas at room temperature. Chlorine is also a gas, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. This trend is due to the increasing strength of the intermolecular van der Waals forces as the size and number of electrons in the molecules increase down the group. Fluorine has the weakest intermolecular forces and therefore the lowest boiling point in the group, causing it to be a gas at room temperature."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_424.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "24 when aluminium is placed in dilute hydrochloric acid, there is no reaction.\nwhen zinc is placed in dilute hydrochloric acid, bubbles of gas are immediately given off.\nwhich statement correctly explains these observations?\na_ aluminium is coated with a layer of aluminium oxide.\nb_ aluminium is more reactive than hydrogen.\nc_ aluminium is less reactive than zinc.\nd_ zincis less reactive than hydrogen.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation\n\n#### Correct Answer: A\n\nAluminium is a highly reactive metal, positioned well above hydrogen in the reactivity series. It is even more reactive than zinc. Based on its position, it should react vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid. However, the observation is that no reaction occurs. This apparent lack of reactivity is due to the phenomenon of passivation. When aluminium is exposed to air, it rapidly reacts with oxygen to form a thin, but very tough, chemically inert, and continuous layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface. This oxide layer is insoluble in water and acts as a protective barrier, preventing the hydrochloric acid from reaching the pure, reactive aluminium metal underneath. Consequently, no reaction is observed.\n\n#### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis statement, \"Aluminium is more reactive than hydrogen,\" is factually correct. However, it does not explain the observation that there is *no reaction*. According to the principles of the reactivity series, if a metal is more reactive than hydrogen, it should react with a dilute acid like hydrochloric acid to displace hydrogen gas. Since the observation is the opposite of what this principle would predict, this statement cannot be the explanation for the lack of reaction.\n\n#### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis statement, \"Aluminium is less reactive than zinc,\" is factually incorrect. In the reactivity series, aluminium is placed above zinc, indicating that it is more reactive. If this statement were true, one might expect a slower reaction than zinc, but not necessarily a complete lack of reaction, as both metals are above hydrogen. The primary reason for the lack of reaction is the oxide layer, not a lower reactivity.\n\n#### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis statement, \"Zinc is less reactive than hydrogen,\" is factually incorrect and is directly contradicted by the information given in the question. The observation that \"bubbles of gas are immediately given off\" when zinc is placed in dilute hydrochloric acid is evidence that a chemical reaction is occurring. This reaction is the displacement of hydrogen from the acid by zinc (Zn + 2HCl \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082).

This process relies on connecting the iron to a more reactive metal. The more reactive metal will corrode (oxidize) preferentially, thus \"sacrificing\" itself to protect the iron.\n\n*   **Statement 3 is correct.** For a metal to act as a sacrificial protector for iron, it must be more reactive than iron. The reactivity series places copper below iron, meaning copper is less reactive. If copper were connected to iron in the presence of an electrolyte (like water), it would actually accelerate the rusting of iron. The more reactive metal, iron, would lose electrons and corrode, while the less reactive metal, copper, would act as a site for reduction. Therefore, copper is not used as a sacrificial protector for iron.\n*   **Statement 4 is correct.** Magnesium is significantly more reactive than iron. This high reactivity means magnesium has a much greater tendency to lose electrons (undergo oxidation) compared to iron. When magnesium is in electrical contact with iron, it becomes the anode and corrodes, releasing electrons. The iron becomes the cathode and is protected from oxidation (rusting). The statement accurately describes that magnesium is used as a sacrificial protector because it loses electrons more readily than iron.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**Incorrect Statement: 1**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies that a more reactive metal is used for sacrificial protection but gives the incorrect reason. The more reactive metal protects the iron because it undergoes **oxidation** more readily, not reduction. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and the sacrificial metal loses its electrons instead of the iron. Reduction is the gain of electrons, which is what happens to oxygen in the rusting process, but not to the sacrificial metal.\n\n**Incorrect Statement: 2**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies zinc as a suitable sacrificial protector for iron (as zinc is more reactive than iron) but provides an incorrect explanation. Zinc protects iron because it **loses** electrons more readily than iron, not because it gains them. The process of gaining electrons is reduction. In sacrificial protection, the more reactive metal (zinc) is oxidized (loses electrons) to prevent the oxidation of the less reactive metal (iron)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_426.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "26 aluminium is extracted from its ore by electrolysis.\nwhat is the role of cryolite in this process?\na to lower the operating temperature\nb _ to lower the boiling point of bauxite\nc_ to raise the melting point of bauxite\nd_ toact asa catalyst", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe extraction of aluminium involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083), also known as alumina, which is obtained by purifying bauxite ore. Pure alumina has a very high melting point of approximately 2072 \u00b0C. Maintaining such a high temperature for an industrial process is extremely expensive due to the vast amount of energy required. To make the process economically viable, the alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na\u2083AlF\u2086). The resulting mixture has a much lower melting point, around 900-1000 \u00b0C. This significantly reduces the energy costs and allows the electrolysis to be carried out at a more manageable temperature. Therefore, the primary role of cryolite is to lower the operating temperature of the electrolytic cell.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B: to lower the boiling point of bauxite**\n    This statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, electrolysis is performed on the molten (liquid) substance, so the relevant physical property is the melting point, not the boiling point. Secondly, the electrolysis is not carried out on bauxite directly, but on purified aluminium oxide (alumina).\n\n*   **C: to raise the melting point of bauxite**\n    This is incorrect as it describes the opposite of cryolite's function. The purpose of adding cryolite is to make the process more energy-efficient and cost-effective by *decreasing* the temperature required. Raising the melting point would make the process even more difficult and expensive.\n\n*   **D: to act as a catalyst**\n    This is incorrect. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed itself. While cryolite facilitates the overall process, its main role is not catalytic. It acts as a solvent for the aluminium oxide, altering the physical properties (i.e., the melting point) of the electrolyte to allow the process to occur under more economical conditions.

One of the bonds (the \u03c0-bond) opens up, allowing the two carbon atoms to form new single bonds. The bromine molecule (Br\u2082) splits, and one bromine atom adds to the second carbon atom, while the other bromine atom adds to the third carbon atom. This saturates the molecule, converting the double bond into a single bond. The resulting product is 2,3-dibromobutane (CH\u2083-CHBr-CHBr-CH\u2083).

The process used to separate this mixture into its more useful components, or 'fractions', is fractional distillation. In this industrial process, crude oil is heated to a high temperature to vaporise it. The vapour is then fed into the bottom of a tall fractionating column, which has a temperature gradient (hottest at the bottom and coolest at the top). As the hot vapours rise, they cool and condense at different levels (on trays) according to their boiling points. Fractions with higher boiling points (longer hydrocarbon chains) condense at lower levels, while fractions with lower boiling points (shorter hydrocarbon chains) rise higher up the column before condensing. This allows for the collection of various useful substances such as refinery gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, and lubricating oil.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. Bitumen is used as a fuel for ships.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bitumen is the residue left at the very bottom of the fractionating column after the fractional distillation of petroleum. It is a thick, black, viscous liquid with a very high boiling point. Its primary uses are for making asphalt to surface roads and for waterproofing roofs. The fuel used for large ships is typically heavy fuel oil, which is a less viscous fraction collected higher up the column than bitumen.\n\n**B. Coal, natural gas and oxygen are all fuels.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A fuel is defined as a substance that undergoes combustion (burns) to release thermal energy. Coal and natural gas are both fossil fuels and fit this definition. However, oxygen is not a fuel. Oxygen is an oxidant; it is the gas that is required for the combustion of a fuel to occur. The chemical reaction of combustion involves the fuel reacting with oxygen, but oxygen itself does not burn.\n\n**C. Hydrogen is the main constituent of natural gas.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The main constituent of natural gas is methane, which has the chemical formula CH\u2084. While methane molecules contain hydrogen atoms, the primary component of the gas mixture is the compound methane, typically comprising 70-90% of the total volume.

Ethanoic acid has the chemical formula CH\u2083COOH. Its structure consists of a chain of two carbon atoms linked together by a single covalent bond (C-C). Because there are no double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms in its structure, ethanoic acid is classified as a saturated compound.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) The molecule dissociates completely in water.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the property of dissociation in water relates to a substance's acidic strength, not its saturation. Saturation is a structural feature concerning the types of bonds between carbon atoms. Secondly, ethanoic acid is a weak acid, meaning it only partially dissociates in water, establishing an equilibrium (CH\u2083COOH \u21cc CH\u2083COO\u207b + H\u207a). It does not dissociate completely.\n\n**B) There is a carbon\u2013oxygen double bond in the molecule.**\nWhile it is true that ethanoic acid contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) within its carboxyl functional group (-COOH), this does not determine its saturation. The definition of saturation in an organic compound is based exclusively on the bonds between the carbon atoms in the carbon chain. The presence of multiple bonds to other elements, such as oxygen, does not make the compound unsaturated.\n\n**D) All the carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds in the molecule are single bonds.**\nThis statement is true; carbon-hydrogen bonds are always single bonds in stable organic molecules. However, this is not the feature that defines a compound as saturated. Unsaturated compounds, such as ethene (C\u2082H\u2084), also have only single carbon-hydrogen bonds.

A key characteristic is that each successive member differs from the next by a -CH\u2082 group. This means that as you move through a homologous series, the number of carbon atoms and the length of the carbon chain increase.\n\nPhysical properties, such as boiling point, melting point, and density, are largely determined by the strength of intermolecular forces. In non-polar or weakly polar organic compounds like alkanes, these are primarily van der Waals forces. As the number of carbon atoms and electrons in a molecule increases, the strength of the van der Waals forces also increases. Consequently, more energy is required to overcome these forces, leading to a gradual increase in boiling and melting points down the series. Therefore, compounds in the same homologous series have different physical properties because they have different numbers of carbon atoms.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. They have the same chemical properties because they have the same number of carbon atoms.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, while compounds in a homologous series have *similar* chemical properties due to the same functional group, the primary reason for this similarity is the functional group itself, not the number of carbon atoms. Secondly, and more importantly, members of a homologous series, by definition, have *different* numbers of carbon atoms.\n\n**B. They have the same physical properties because they have the same number of carbon atoms.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As explained above, the physical properties of compounds in a homologous series are not the same; they show a clear, predictable trend (e.g., increasing boiling points) as the carbon chain gets longer. Furthermore, the reason given is false, as members of a homologous series have different numbers of carbon atoms.\n\n**C. They have different chemical properties because they have different numbers of carbon atoms.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining feature of a homologous series is that all members possess the same functional group, which means they undergo the same types of chemical reactions and thus have *similar* chemical properties.

Its properties are determined by its molecular structure and bonding.\n\n1.  **Solubility in water:** Methane is a nonpolar molecule because the C-H bonds have very low polarity and the molecule has a symmetrical tetrahedral geometry, which causes any small bond dipoles to cancel out. Water is a highly polar solvent. According to the \"like dissolves like\" principle, nonpolar substances are generally insoluble in polar solvents. Therefore, methane is not soluble in water.\n\n2.  **State at room temperature:** Methane is a small molecule with a low molar mass. The only intermolecular forces present between methane molecules are weak London dispersion forces. Consequently, very little energy is needed to overcome these forces, resulting in a very low boiling point of -161.6 \u00b0C. Since room temperature (approximately 20-25 \u00b0C) is well above its boiling point, methane exists as a gas.\n\n3.  **Test with aqueous bromine:** The reaction with aqueous bromine (bromine water) is a chemical test used to distinguish between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds and will undergo an addition reaction with bromine, causing the reddish-brown bromine water to decolorize. Methane is an alkane, which is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning it only contains single bonds. It does not react with aqueous bromine under normal conditions. Therefore, it gives a negative test (the bromine water remains reddish-brown).\n\nBased on this analysis, methane is not soluble in water, is a gas at room temperature, and does not give a positive test with aqueous bromine. This corresponds to the properties listed in row A.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that methane gives a positive test with aqueous bromine. Methane is a saturated alkane (CH\u2084) and lacks the carbon-carbon double or triple bonds necessary for the addition reaction that decolorizes bromine water. Only unsaturated compounds like alkenes give a positive test.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. First, it states that methane is soluble in water. As a nonpolar molecule, methane is insoluble in polar water. Second, it states that methane is a liquid at room temperature. Due to its very low boiling point (-161.6 \u00b0C), methane is a gas at room temperature.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect on all three points. It incorrectly claims that methane is soluble in water, is a liquid at room temperature, and gives a positive test with aqueous bromine.

In contrast, the hydration of ethene requires a high temperature of 300 \u00b0C and a high pressure of 60 atm. Maintaining these high-temperature and high-pressure conditions necessitates a significant input of energy, leading to higher operational costs. Therefore, the low energy consumption of the fermentation process is a major advantage over the hydration of ethene.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Fermentation takes several days to complete.**\nThis statement describes a disadvantage, not an advantage. Fermentation is a batch process that proceeds at a slow rate. In an industrial context, a slow reaction rate reduces the overall productivity and efficiency of the manufacturing plant. The catalytic hydration of ethene is a faster, continuous process, which allows for a greater output of ethanol in a shorter period, making it more efficient for large-scale production.\n\n**C. The fermentation of glucose from sugar cane produces pure ethanol.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The process of fermentation produces a dilute aqueous solution of ethanol, typically with a concentration of around 10-15%. The yeast enzymes that catalyse the reaction are denatured by higher concentrations of ethanol, which stops the process. To obtain pure (or concentrated) ethanol, this dilute mixture must undergo further purification, usually by fractional distillation, which is an additional, energy-intensive step.\n\n**D. Fermentation uses a non-renewable raw material.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The raw material for fermentation listed is sugar cane, which is a plant.

In a liquid, particles are in constant, random motion and possess a range of kinetic energies. The particles with the highest kinetic energy at the surface can overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction holding them in the liquid and escape into the surrounding air as a gas (vapor).\n\nEthanol is a volatile liquid, which means it evaporates easily at room temperature. In an open beaker, the ethanol vapor is free to diffuse away. Over a period of 24 hours, this continuous escape of particles from the liquid surface causes the entire sample of ethanol to change from a liquid to a gas, leaving the beaker empty.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It has boiled.**\nBoiling is a rapid change of state from liquid to gas that occurs throughout the entire volume of the liquid at a specific temperature called the boiling point. The boiling point of ethanol is approximately 78\u00b0C. Since the ethanol was kept at room temperature (around 20-25\u00b0C), it was not heated to its boiling point and therefore could not have boiled.\n\n**B. It has condensed.**\nCondensation is the process where a substance in a gaseous state changes to a liquid state. This is the reverse of what happened. The ethanol started as a liquid and disappeared, meaning it turned into a gas, not the other way around.\n\n**D. It has frozen.**\nFreezing is the process where a liquid changes into a solid. This occurs at the substance's freezing point. The freezing point of ethanol is approximately -114\u00b0C, which is far below room temperature.

When the temperature of the gas is increased, the molecules absorb this energy, which increases their average kinetic energy.\n*   **Statement 2: They collide with the walls of the container more frequently.** This is also correct. An increase in kinetic energy means the molecules are moving at a higher average speed.

To achieve a stable, full outer electron shell (like a noble gas), it is most energetically favourable for a sodium atom to lose the single electron in its outermost shell. By losing one electron, it becomes a positively charged ion (Na\u207a) with a stable electron configuration of 2, 8.\n\n2.  **Chlorine (Cl):** Chlorine is a Group 17 element with the electron configuration 2, 8, 7. To achieve a stable octet (eight electrons) in its outer shell, it needs to gain one electron. By gaining one electron, it becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl\u207b) with a stable electron configuration of 2, 8, 8.\n\nTherefore, in the reaction, each sodium atom transfers one electron to a chlorine atom. The resulting oppositely charged ions, Na\u207a and Cl\u207b, are then held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction, forming the ionic compound sodium chloride.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answers**\n\n**A. Sodium atoms each gain one electron, and chlorine atoms each lose one electron.**\nThis statement incorrectly reverses the process. Metals, like sodium, tend to lose electrons to form positive ions, while non-metals, like chlorine, tend to gain electrons to form negative ions. A sodium atom gaining an electron would result in an unstable configuration (2, 8, 2), and a chlorine atom losing an electron would also lead to a less stable state.\n\n**C. Sodium atoms and chlorine atoms share one electron with each other.**\nThis describes the formation of a single covalent bond. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons and typically occurs between non-metal atoms. The reaction between a metal (sodium) and a non-metal (chlorine) involves a transfer of electrons due to the large difference in their electronegativities, resulting in an ionic bond, not a covalent one.\n\n**D. Sodium atoms and chlorine atoms share two electrons with each other.**\nThis describes the formation of a double covalent bond. As with option C, this is incorrect because the bonding between sodium and chlorine is ionic, not covalent. Furthermore, a sodium atom only has one valence electron to contribute, and a chlorine atom only needs one electron to achieve a stable octet, so sharing two electrons would not be the mechanism for bonding between these two atoms."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_444.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "4 the table shows some properties of four substances.\nwhen solid when molten\n1 high poor poor\n2 high poor good\n3 low poor poor\n4 high good good\nwhich substances are ionic?\na 1,3 and4 b 1tand3only c 2and4 d 2only", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nIonic compounds possess a unique set of physical properties derived from their structure and bonding.

To achieve stable electron configurations, non-metals share electrons, forming covalent bonds. A carbon atom has four valence electrons and requires four more to complete its outer shell. A hydrogen atom has one valence electron and requires one more. Consequently, a central carbon atom shares a pair of electrons with each of four hydrogen atoms, forming four single covalent bonds. This sharing of electrons is the defining characteristic of covalent bonding.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. In methane, positive hydrogen ions are attracted to negative carbon ions.**\n\nThis statement describes ionic bonding, which involves the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal, creating oppositely charged ions that are electrostatically attracted to each other. Methane is a covalent compound formed between two non-metals. Electrons are shared, not transferred, so no ions are formed.\n\n**C. Methane has a high boiling point.**\n\nMethane is a simple molecular substance. It consists of discrete CH\u2084 molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). While the covalent bonds within the molecules are strong, very little energy is required to overcome the weak forces between the molecules. Therefore, simple molecular substances like methane have low melting and boiling points. Methane's boiling point is -161.5 \u00b0C.\n\n**D. Methane is a good conductor of electricity.**\n\nElectrical conductivity requires the presence of mobile charged particles, such as free-moving ions or delocalised electrons. As a simple molecular compound, methane has neither. It does not contain ions, and its electrons are held in fixed positions within the covalent bonds. Lacking mobile charge carriers, methane cannot conduct electricity in any state (solid, liquid, or gas)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_446.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "6 asample of iridium has a relative atomic mass of 192.29.\nthe sample contains two isotopes only.\n64.50% of the sample is \u2018ir.\nwhat is the other isotope in the sample?\na \u201cir b ir e ir d \u201cir", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: C**\n\nThe relative atomic mass (A\u1d63) of an element is the weighted average mass of its isotopes.

Firstly, hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode (site of reduction), not the anode (site of oxidation). Secondly, in the electrolysis of **molten** sodium chloride, the only ions present are Na\u207a and Cl\u207b. There are no hydrogen ions or water molecules, so hydrogen gas cannot be produced. Instead, sodium metal is formed at the cathode.\n\n**B) molten sodium chloride / aqueous sodium chloride / cathode**\n\nThis option is incorrect because hydrogen gas is not produced during the electrolysis of **molten** sodium chloride. Molten NaCl contains only Na\u207a and Cl\u207b ions. At the cathode, sodium ions are reduced to form molten sodium metal (Na\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Na). Hydrogen gas can only be produced if hydrogen ions or water molecules are present, which is not the case in a molten salt.\n\n**C) dilute sulfuric acid / concentrated hydrochloric acid / anode**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it identifies the wrong electrode.

Oxidation, the loss of electrons, occurs at the anode. When electrolysing aqueous copper(II) sulfate using inert carbon electrodes, there are two types of negative ions (anions) that migrate to the positive anode: sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) from the copper(II) sulfate and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) from the partial dissociation of water.\n\nAccording to the rules of selective discharge at the anode, hydroxide ions are more readily oxidised than sulfate ions. The hydroxide ions lose electrons and are converted into oxygen gas and water. The half-equation for this reaction is: 4OH\u207b(aq) \u2192 O\u2082(g) + 2H\u2082O(l) + 4e\u207b.

While copper is indeed deposited during this electrolysis, it happens at the cathode.\n\n**B. Copper is deposited if the electrode is made from copper.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as with option A, the deposition of copper occurs at the negative electrode (cathode), not the positive electrode (anode). Secondly, at the positive copper electrode, the copper atoms of the electrode itself are oxidised and dissolve into the solution as copper ions (Cu \u2192 Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b), rather than copper being deposited onto it.\n\n**D. Oxygen gas is produced if the electrode is made from copper.**\nThis statement is incorrect because when a reactive or \"active\" electrode like copper is used as the anode, it is easier to oxidise the copper atoms of the electrode itself than it is to oxidise the hydroxide or sulfate ions in the solution.

An exothermic reaction is one that releases energy into the surroundings, typically in the form of heat and, in this case, electrical energy.

Chemical energy is converted into electrical energy.**\nThis statement is correct. A hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is an electrochemical cell designed specifically to convert the chemical potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of the reactants (hydrogen and oxygen) directly into electrical energy through a controlled redox reaction. This is the fundamental principle of operation for all fuel cells and galvanic cells.\n\n**B. Hydrogen is oxidised.**\nThis statement is correct. In a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, hydrogen gas is supplied to the anode (the negative electrode). Here, it undergoes oxidation, which is the process of losing electrons. The hydrogen molecules (H\u2082) are split into hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and electrons (e\u207b), or they react with hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) to form water and release electrons, depending on the type of electrolyte.

No new substances are created in this process.\n\n---\n### **Analysis of Incorrect Options**\n\n**A. heating calcium carbonate strongly**\nThis process involves a chemical change, specifically thermal decomposition. When calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) is heated strongly, it breaks down into two new substances: calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).

Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favouring the decomposition of ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (B)\n\nLe Chatelier's principle states that if the temperature of a system at equilibrium is changed, the equilibrium will shift to counteract the change. The forward reaction is stated to be exothermic, meaning it releases heat. Consequently, the reverse reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat.\n\nIf the temperature is decreased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that produces heat to raise the temperature. This is the exothermic direction. For the Haber process, the forward reaction (production of ammonia) is exothermic.

Nitrogen (N\u2082) is a reactant in the forward reaction.\n\nIf more nitrogen gas is added to the mixture, its concentration increases.

When an element gains negatively charged electrons, its oxidation number decreases.\n- **Oxidation** is the loss of electrons. When an element loses negatively charged electrons, its oxidation number increases.\n\nThe statement correctly describes this relationship. \"When one element gains electrons,\" it is being reduced. In a chemical reaction, electrons cannot be created or destroyed, so the electrons gained by one element must have been lost by another. The loss of electrons by this \"different element\" is oxidation, which results in an increase in its oxidation number.

It achieves this by donating electrons to that substance, and in the process, the reducing agent itself gets oxidised.\nThe statement incorrectly claims the opposite roles for each agent.\n\n**C: When the oxidation number of one element increases, a different element gains oxygen.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it links two processes that are both forms of oxidation. An increase in the oxidation number is, by definition, oxidation. The gain of oxygen is also a way to define oxidation. A redox reaction requires both an oxidation and a reduction process to occur together. If one element is oxidised (its oxidation number increases), a different element must be reduced (e.g., its oxidation number decreases, or it loses oxygen). Furthermore, many redox reactions do not involve oxygen at all.\n\n**D: When the oxidation number of one element increases, a different element loses electrons.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes two oxidation processes occurring simultaneously without a corresponding reduction. An increase in the oxidation number of an element is the result of that element losing electrons. Therefore, the statement suggests that one element is oxidised, and another element is also oxidised (loses electrons). This violates the principle of electron conservation in a redox reaction. If one species loses electrons (is oxidised), another species must gain those electrons (be reduced)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p2_460.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "20 aluminium is extracted from aluminium oxide by electrolysis. the ionic half-equation for the\nreaction at one of the electrodes is shown.\nal* + 3e\u00b0 > al\nwhich row describes the change in oxidation number of the aluminium and the type of reaction at\nthis electrode?\nchange in oxidation wee of reaction\nnumber of aluminium yp a\na decrease reduction\nb decrease oxidation\ncc increase reduction\nd increase oxidation", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided ionic half-equation is Al\u00b3\u207a + 3e\u207b \u2192 Al.\n\nTo determine the correct description, we must analyse both the change in oxidation number and the type of reaction.\n\n1.  **Change in Oxidation Number:**\n    *   The reactant is the aluminium ion, Al\u00b3\u207a.

Ethene (C\u2082H\u2084) is a small alkene and a highly valuable product of cracking, primarily used to manufacture polymers like poly(ethene). This industrial process is essential because the demand for smaller hydrocarbons (like petrol) and alkenes is much higher than their supply from the fractional distillation of crude oil alone.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A low temperature is required.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Cracking involves the breaking of strong covalent C-C and C-H bonds within the large alkane molecules. This is a process that requires a substantial input of energy. Therefore, cracking is carried out at very high temperatures. For example, steam cracking occurs at temperatures above 800\u00b0C, and catalytic cracking uses temperatures around 600-700\u00b0C along with a catalyst.\n\n**C. The process requires an excess of oxygen.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The presence of oxygen during cracking would lead to the combustion of the hydrocarbons, rather than their decomposition into smaller molecules. Complete combustion in an excess of oxygen would produce carbon dioxide and water, which are not the desired products. Cracking must be carried out in the absence of air (oxygen) to prevent this unwanted side reaction.\n\n**D. Water is also a product.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactant in this process is a large alkane, which is a hydrocarbon containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. According to the law of conservation of mass, atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. Since there are no oxygen atoms present in the reactant, it is impossible for water (H\u2082O), which contains oxygen, to be formed as a product.

When heated with a strong oxidizing agent, such as acidified potassium manganate(VII) (KMnO\u2084), it undergoes complete oxidation. The product of this reaction is ethanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH). The purple manganate(VII) ions are reduced to colourless manganese(II) ions, providing a distinct colour change that indicates the reaction has occurred. This is a standard laboratory method for preparing carboxylic acids from primary alcohols.\n\n2.  **Bacterial oxidation of ethanol:** This is a biochemical process where microorganisms, specifically bacteria from the genus *Acetobacter*, oxidize ethanol to ethanoic acid in the presence of oxygen from the air.

Fractional distillation of a fermented mixture, for example, is used to increase the concentration of ethanol, not to convert it into ethanoic acid.\n\n**D. 3 only:** This option is incorrect. Distilling ethanol using a fractionating column (fractional distillation) is a physical process for purification.

Propene undergoes an addition reaction to form an alkane.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Propene (C\u2083H\u2086), an alkene, can be converted into propane (C\u2083H\u2088), an alkane, through a process called catalytic hydrogenation. This is an addition reaction where hydrogen gas (H\u2082) is added across the carbon-carbon double bond in the presence of a metal catalyst, such as nickel, platinum, or palladium, and heat. The double bond breaks, and the molecule becomes saturated, forming an alkane.\n\nThe reaction is:\nC\u2083H\u2086 (propene) + H\u2082 (hydrogen) \u2192 C\u2083H\u2088 (propane)\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Propene reacts with bromine in the dark in a substitution reaction.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the reaction of propene with bromine is an **addition** reaction, not a substitution reaction. Due to the presence of the C=C double bond, propene is unsaturated and readily undergoes addition reactions. When propene reacts with aqueous bromine (bromine water), the double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each of the carbon atoms that were part of the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. This reaction occurs rapidly at room temperature, even in the dark, and is the basis for the chemical test for unsaturation. Substitution reactions with bromine are characteristic of alkanes and typically require ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n**B. Propene reacts with steam in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, forming an alcohol.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect regarding the type of catalyst used. Propene does react with steam (hydration) to form an alcohol (propan-2-ol). However, this industrial process requires high temperature (e.g., 300\u00b0C), high pressure (e.g., 60-70 atm), and an **acidic** catalyst, such as solid silicon dioxide coated with phosphoric(V) acid (H\u2083PO\u2084).

While propene does undergo addition polymerisation, the resulting polymer is named after its monomer.
