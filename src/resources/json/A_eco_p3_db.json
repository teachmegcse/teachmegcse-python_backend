A rational consumer is defined as an economic agent who aims to maximise their total utility (satisfaction) from consumption, subject to their income or budget constraint. For this to be possible, several conditions must be met:\n\n1.  **Access to Complete Information:** A consumer must have perfect or complete information about all available goods and services. This includes knowledge of their prices, quality, and, crucially, the amount of utility each unit will provide. Without this information, a consumer cannot make a calculated decision to maximise their utility. Therefore, 'yes' is the correct response for this condition.\n2.  **Absence of Addictive Behaviour:** Rational choice theory assumes that consumers act in their own best interest to maximise long-term well-being. Addictive behaviour is considered irrational because it involves a compulsion to consume a good, often in quantities that are known to be detrimental to the consumer's overall utility or welfare. Such behaviour bypasses the logical calculation of costs and benefits. Therefore, a rational consumer would not exhibit addictive behaviour, making 'no' the correct response.\n3.  **Independent Choice:** The choices of a rational consumer are based solely on their personal preferences and budget. They are not influenced by the consumption patterns or choices of others. This assumption rules out social phenomena such as the 'bandwagon effect' (consuming something because it is popular) or the 'snob effect' (avoiding a good because it is popular). The consumer's utility function is independent. Therefore, 'yes' is the correct response for this condition.\n\nOption D correctly identifies these three core conditions: access to complete information, the absence of addictive behaviour, and making choices independent of other consumers.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it states that a rational consumer does not need access to complete information and exhibits addictive behaviour. A lack of complete information prevents the consumer from making an informed, utility-maximising decision. Furthermore, addictive behaviour is, by definition, a form of irrationality where choice is driven by compulsion rather than a deliberate calculation of maximising well-being.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it suggests that a rational consumer's choice is not independent of other consumers. A core tenet of rational choice theory is that individuals make decisions based on their own utility schedules and budget constraints. If a consumer's choices are influenced by others (e.g., through peer pressure or trends), their decisions are not being made solely to maximise their own personal utility, which violates the assumption of rationality.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, it states that a rational consumer exhibits addictive behaviour, which contradicts the principle of making choices to maximise long-term utility. Secondly, it suggests that choices are not independent of other consumers, which violates the assumption that decisions are based purely on individual preferences and constraints. While consumers may have complete information, these other two conditions render the behaviour irrational according to standard economic theory."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_2.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "2 the price of good s is $6 and the price of good t is $8. a consumer's marginal utility for each\ngood is shown.\nof good s of good t\n1 36 32\n2 24 22\n3 18 20\n4 9 18\n5 0 9\nif this consumer wants to maximise total utility, which combination of goods would they consume?\ngood s good t\na 1 1\nb 2 1\ncc 3 4\nd 5 5", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA rational consumer maximises total utility by allocating their expenditure according to the equimarginal principle. This principle states that total utility is maximised when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods consumed.

The new budget line pivots outwards from the y-intercept (F) to a new x-intercept to the right of H. The y-intercept represents the maximum quantity of good Y that can be purchased (Income / Price of Y). Since the y-intercept at F is unchanged, the price of good Y and the consumer's nominal income have remained constant. The x-intercept represents the maximum quantity of good X that can be purchased (Income / Price of X). As the x-intercept has moved to the right, the consumer can now afford more of good X, which signifies that the price of good X has fallen. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Substitution Effect Analysis:** The substitution effect measures the change in consumption of a good due to a change in its relative price, holding the level of utility constant. When the price of good X falls, it becomes relatively cheaper compared to good Y. A rational consumer will substitute towards the relatively cheaper good. This effect always leads to an increase in the quantity demanded for the good whose price has decreased. Therefore, the substitution effect for good X is positive. This is consistent with both options A and B.\n\n3.  **Income Effect Analysis:** The income effect measures the change in consumption due to the change in real income (or purchasing power) that results from the price change. A fall in the price of good X increases the consumer's real income.\n    *   A **positive income effect** occurs if the good is a **normal good**, meaning that as real income rises, the consumer buys more of it.\n    *   A **negative income effect** occurs if the good is an **inferior good**, meaning that as real income rises, the consumer buys less of it.\n    The total change in quantity demanded is the sum of the substitution and income effects. In the diagram, the final consumption of good X at E2 is greater than the initial consumption at E1. This means the total price effect is positive. For option B to be correct, the income effect must be negative, implying good X is an inferior good. The overall increase in consumption means that the positive substitution effect (which encourages more consumption of X) must be stronger than the negative income effect (which discourages consumption of X). This is the standard case for an inferior good that is not a Giffen good.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the price of X has fallen, leading to a positive substitution effect. If we deduce that good X is an inferior good, the income effect would be negative. Since the total consumption of X increases, the substitution effect must outweigh the income effect. This combination of effects corresponds to option B.\n\n**Incorrect Options Analysis:**\n\n*   **A:** This option is incorrect because it suggests a positive income effect. A positive income effect would mean that good X is a normal good, where the increase in real income from the price fall leads to a further increase in its consumption. While the diagram visually supports this, option B describes the case of an inferior good.\n*   **C:** This option is incorrect because the price of Y did not rise. The y-intercept of the budget line remained unchanged at point F, indicating that the price of Y was constant.\n*   **D:** This option is incorrect for the same reason as C; the price of Y did not change. The change was a fall in the price of good X."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_4.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "4 what is likely to help create dynamic efficiency?\na_ entry barriers are reduced to increase competition in the market.\nb_ firms are legally bound to produce where price equals marginal cost.\nc_ taxes on profits are raised to encourage firms to produce where price equals average cost.\nd_ taxes on retained profits are reduced to encourage investment in new technology.", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nDynamic efficiency is concerned with the productive efficiency of a firm over time. It is achieved through investment in research and development (R&D) and new capital, which leads to the creation of new technologies, improved production processes, and better-quality products. Reducing taxes on retained profits directly increases the funds a firm has available for reinvestment. This policy strengthens the incentive for firms to use their profits to finance the acquisition of new technology and fund R&D projects, rather than distributing them to shareholders. Such investment is the primary driver of dynamic efficiency, as it leads to lower long-run average costs and enhanced product innovation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Entry barriers are reduced to increase competition in the market.**\nThis policy primarily targets static efficiency, specifically allocative and productive efficiency. Reducing barriers to entry intensifies competition, which forces firms to minimise costs (productive efficiency) and pushes prices closer to marginal cost (allocative efficiency). However, the effect on dynamic efficiency is ambiguous and often negative. Intense competition can erode the supernormal profits that firms often rely on to fund costly and risky long-term R&D projects. Without the cushion of supernormal profits, firms may lack the ability to invest in innovation, thereby hindering dynamic efficiency.\n\n**B. Firms are legally bound to produce where price equals marginal cost.**\nThis is the condition for allocative efficiency, where resources are allocated in a way that maximises societal welfare. Forcing firms to produce at this point ensures that the price consumers are willing to pay for the last unit is equal to the cost of producing it. However, this policy does not promote dynamic efficiency. In fact, by setting price equal to marginal cost, a firm (particularly a monopolist) may be unable to earn supernormal profits, which are a critical source of funds for investment in new technology and R&D. Without these funds, a firm's capacity for innovation is diminished.\n\n**C. Taxes on profits are raised to encourage firms to produce where price equals average cost.**\nThis statement contains flawed economic reasoning. Firstly, raising taxes on profits reduces a firm's post-tax earnings, thereby decreasing the funds available for reinvestment and diminishing the incentive to innovate. This would hinder, not help, dynamic efficiency. Secondly, a tax on profits does not encourage a firm to produce where price equals average cost (the break-even point). A profit-maximising firm will continue to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, and the tax will simply reduce the final profit figure. This policy would be counterproductive to achieving any form of efficiency."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_5.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "5 at which level of output is sales maximisation achieved consistent with earning normal profit?\nmc\ncost or\nprice ac\n$\n\\> an\ni ar\no a bc d\nquantity", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThis level of output, OD, is where the Average Revenue (AR) curve intersects the Average Cost (AC) curve. At this point, AR = AC. This means the firm's total revenue is exactly equal to its total cost (including all implicit and explicit costs), which is the definition of earning a normal profit. A firm aiming to maximise its sales volume, subject to a minimum profit constraint (i.e., not making a loss), will produce up to this point. If it were to produce any quantity beyond OD, its average cost would exceed its average revenue (AC > AR), resulting in a loss. Therefore, OD represents the maximum possible level of output and sales that can be achieved while still earning at least a normal profit.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** At output level OA, the Marginal Revenue (MR) curve intersects the Marginal Cost (MC) curve. The condition MR = MC identifies the profit-maximising level of output. The firm's objective here is sales maximisation, not profit maximisation. While the firm is profitable at this output (as AR > AC), it has not maximised its sales volume.\n\n*   **B:** At output level OB, the Marginal Revenue (MR) curve is equal to zero (MR=0). This is the level of output that maximises the firm's total sales revenue, not necessarily its sales volume. The firm can still increase its production and sales quantity beyond OB and remain profitable, as its Average Revenue (AR) is still above its Average Cost (AC) at this point. The sales volume maximisation point occurs at a higher output level.\n\n*   **C:** At output level OC, the Marginal Cost (MC) curve intersects the Average Revenue (AR) curve. This point, where Price (AR) = MC, represents the allocatively efficient level of output. This is a benchmark for social welfare, not a goal for a sales-maximising firm. The firm can still expand production beyond OC while meeting its constraint of earning at least a normal profit."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_6.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "6 what is achieved in monopolistic competition in the long run?\n| ae [a\nefficiency profit\na no no\nb no yes\ncc yes no\nd yes yes", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nIn the long-run equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive market, firms do not achieve allocative efficiency, nor do they earn supernormal profits.\n\n1.  **Supernormal Profit:** While a firm in monopolistic competition can earn supernormal profits in the short run due to product differentiation, these profits are not sustainable in the long run. The market is characterised by low barriers to entry. The existence of supernormal profits signals an opportunity for new firms to enter the market. As new firms enter, they introduce more close substitutes, which causes the demand curve for each existing firm to shift to the left and become more price elastic. This process continues until the demand (Average Revenue) curve is just tangent to the Average Total Cost (ATC) curve. At this point, Price (P) equals ATC, and firms earn only normal profit.\n\n2.  **Allocative Efficiency:** Allocative efficiency occurs when resources are used to produce the quantity of output that society values most, which is achieved at the point where Price (P) equals Marginal Cost (MC). In monopolistic competition, firms face a downward-sloping demand curve because their products are differentiated. To maximise profit, a firm produces where Marginal Revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC). For any firm with a downward-sloping demand curve, the MR curve lies below the demand (P or Average Revenue) curve. Therefore, at the profit-maximising level of output, P > MR. Since MR = MC, it follows that P > MC. Because the price consumers are willing to pay for the last unit is greater than the marginal cost of producing it, there is an under-allocation of resources, and allocative efficiency is not achieved.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because firms in monopolistic competition cannot sustain supernormal profits in the long run. The key characteristic of this market structure is the presence of low barriers to entry and exit. If firms are earning supernormal profits (where Price > Average Total Cost), new firms will be attracted to the industry. The entry of these new competitors increases the number of available substitutes, which erodes the market share and demand for existing firms. This influx of competition continues until all supernormal profits are competed away, and firms are left earning only normal profit (where Price = Average Total Cost).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because firms in monopolistic competition do not achieve allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency is the condition where Price (P) equals Marginal Cost (MC). However, a monopolistically competitive firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve due to product differentiation, giving it some degree of market power. The profit-maximisation rule for such a firm is to produce at the output level where Marginal Revenue (MR) = MC. Because the demand curve is downward-sloping, the price is always greater than the marginal revenue (P > MR) at any given quantity. Consequently, at the profit-maximising output, P > MC. This inequality signifies allocative inefficiency, as the value society places on the last unit produced (P) exceeds the cost of the resources used to produce it (MC).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because neither allocative efficiency nor supernormal profit is achieved in the long run under monopolistic competition. Supernormal profits are competed away due to low barriers to entry, which allows new firms to enter the market until existing firms only earn normal profit (Price = Average Total Cost). Allocative efficiency (Price = Marginal Cost) is not achieved because firms have market power from product differentiation, leading them to set a price that is higher than their marginal cost to maximise profits. Therefore, the long-run equilibrium is characterised by both a lack of supernormal profits and a lack of allocative efficiency."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_7.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "7 the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies developed and distributed an effective vaccine to\ncombat a dangerous virus.\nwhat can be associated with this vaccine programme?\na_ demerit good and negative production externality\nb_ imperfect competition and positive consumption externality\nc perfect competition and negative consumption externality\nd public good and negative production externality", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option correctly identifies two key economic characteristics of a vaccine programme developed by large pharmaceutical companies.\n\n1.  **Imperfect Competition:** The pharmaceutical industry is a classic example of an imperfectly competitive market, specifically an oligopoly. This market structure is characterized by a small number of large firms that dominate the market. These firms face high barriers to entry, such as the immense cost of research and development (R&D), and legal protections like patents, which grant them exclusive rights to produce a new drug for a period. This market power allows them to influence prices and differentiate their products. The phrase \"the world's largest pharmaceutical companies\" directly points to this type of market structure, ruling out perfect competition.\n\n2.  **Positive Consumption Externality:** A vaccine generates significant positive externalities in consumption. An externality is an effect on a third party not directly involved in an economic transaction. When an individual is vaccinated, they receive a private benefit (protection from the virus). However, their consumption also creates a benefit for others in society. By reducing their own likelihood of infection and transmission, they contribute to \"herd immunity,\" which protects vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated and slows the overall spread of the virus. This external benefit means the social benefit of vaccination is greater than the private benefit, which is the definition of a positive consumption externality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. demerit good and negative production externality**\n\nA vaccine is a **merit good**, not a demerit good. Merit goods are those that the government deems beneficial for society and are likely to be under-consumed in a free market because individuals do not fully perceive the private or social benefits (e.g., education, healthcare). A demerit good, in contrast, is considered harmful and is often over-consumed (e.g., cigarettes). Furthermore, the most significant externality associated with a vaccine is the positive externality from its consumption, not a negative production externality (such as pollution, which might occur but is not the defining economic feature of a vaccine programme).\n\n**C. perfect competition and negative consumption externality**\n\nThis option is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, as explained above, the pharmaceutical industry is a clear example of **imperfect competition**, not perfect competition, due to high barriers to entry and the dominance of a few large firms. Secondly, the consumption of a vaccine creates a **positive externality**, not a negative one. A negative consumption externality occurs when consumption imposes a cost on third parties (e.g., noise pollution from a loud party). Vaccination does the opposite by conferring benefits on third parties.\n\n**D. public good and negative production externality**\n\nA vaccine is a **private good**, not a public good. To be classified as a public good, a good must be both **non-rivalrous** (one person's consumption does not reduce its availability to others) and **non-excludable** (it is impossible to prevent people from consuming it). A vaccine fails both tests: it is **rivalrous** because a dose administered to one person cannot be given to another, and it is **excludable** because pharmaceutical companies can charge a price, thereby excluding those who do not or cannot pay."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_8.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "8 a landlord owns a house which is rented to tenants. the tenants are required to pay the\nelectricity and water bills. the landlord is required to decorate and repair damage to the house\nand its gardens.\n\nwhat is not an example of the principal-agent problem?\n\na the tenants forget to switch off a tap when filling a bath and water overflows, damaging the\nfloor.\n\nb_ the tenants have a party and their guests cause damage to the interior of the house.\n\nc_ the tenants leave the lights and the tv on when they go out for an evening meal.\n\nd_ the tenants park their car in the garden, damaging the grass and the surrounding hedge.", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe principal-agent problem arises when there is a conflict of interest between a principal (the landlord) and an agent (the tenants) hired to act on the principal's behalf. This conflict often occurs because the agent's actions are not fully observable and the agent does not bear the full consequences of their actions, leading to moral hazard.\n\nIn this scenario, leaving the lights and TV on results in a higher electricity bill. According to the terms provided, the tenants are required to pay the electricity bill. Therefore, the tenants bear the full financial cost of their own action. Since the negative consequence (higher cost) falls directly on the agent and not the principal, there is no conflict of interest or moral hazard in this specific instance concerning the landlord.

The tenants forget to switch off a tap when filling a bath and water overflows, damaging the floor.**\n\nThis is a clear example of the principal-agent problem. The tenants' negligence causes damage to the property. As the landlord is required to repair damage to the house, the landlord (the principal) bears the cost of repairing the floor. The tenants (the agents) do not bear the full cost of their carelessness, creating a moral hazard. They might be less careful than an owner-occupier because they are insulated from the financial consequences of the damage.\n\n**B. The tenants have a party and their guests cause damage to the interior of the house.**\n\nThis scenario also illustrates the principal-agent problem. The tenants benefit from hosting a party, but the resulting damage to the house is a cost that must be borne by the landlord, who is responsible for repairs. The interests of the tenants (to have a party) and the landlord (to have the property remain undamaged) are in conflict. The tenants do not bear the direct cost of the damage, creating a moral hazard.\n\n**D. The tenants park their car in the garden, damaging the grass and the surrounding hedge.**\n\nThis is another instance of the principal-agent problem. The tenants gain the convenience of a parking spot, but their action imposes a cost in the form of a damaged garden.

However, this does not automatically guarantee the project will be undertaken. Governments operate with finite budgets and have numerous competing projects (e.g., in healthcare, education, defence) that may also yield positive net social benefits. Due to this scarcity of capital, the government must prioritise its spending. It will likely rank all potential projects by their NSB or benefit-cost ratio and allocate its limited funds to the projects that offer the highest social return. The road project, despite being beneficial, might not be approved if there are other projects that are expected to generate an even greater net social benefit and are therefore a better use of scarce public funds. This concept is known as opportunity cost\u2014the value of the next-best alternative foregone.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The project would not be profitable for a private firm.**\nThis statement describes a common reason for *government intervention* in the first place, not a reason to reject a project that has already been deemed socially beneficial. Many projects with significant positive externalities, like roads, are not undertaken by the private sector because it is difficult to charge all users and capture the full value of the benefits generated. Therefore, they are not privately profitable. The government's role is often to provide such goods and services precisely because their social benefits exceed their private benefits, leading to a positive NSB even when private profitability is negative.\n\n**B: The project would cause negative externalities.**\nA comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for a government project explicitly accounts for both positive and negative externalities. Social costs are calculated by adding private costs and external costs (negative externalities like pollution, noise, and congestion). Social benefits include private benefits and external benefits. The fact that the project has a *net* social benefit of $50 million means that the sum of all social benefits is greater than the sum of all social costs, *after* the negative externalities have already been subtracted. Therefore, the existence of negative externalities has already been factored into the final positive result and is not a reason to reject the project on its own.\n\n**D: There would be more who lost than gained.**\nCost-benefit analysis aggregates the monetary value of all costs and benefits; it does not weigh them by the number of people affected. It is possible for a project to have a large positive net social benefit even if a small group of people receive enormous benefits while a larger group suffers minor costs. While the distributional consequences (who wins and who loses) are an important political and ethical consideration that a government might take into account, it is not a direct contradiction of the CBA result. The positive NSB calculation indicates that the total value of the gains is sufficient to, in theory, compensate all the losers and still have a surplus. The core economic reason for rejection, given a positive NSB, relates to resource allocation and opportunity cost, as described in option C."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_10.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "10 if the marginal cost of a good is lower than its price, allocative efficiency has not been achieved.\nwhat is likely to remedy this situation?\nproduction of price of\nthe good the good\na decrease decrease\nb decrease increase\ncc increase decrease\nd increase increase", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAllocative efficiency is a state of economic efficiency where production is aligned with consumer preferences. It is achieved at the output level where the price of a good (P), which represents the marginal benefit or value consumers place on the last unit, is equal to its marginal cost (MC), which represents the cost of resources used to produce that last unit. The condition for allocative efficiency is **P = MC**.\n\nThe scenario given is that the marginal cost is lower than the price (MC < P). This signifies an under-allocation of resources to the production of this good. Society values an additional unit of the good (as shown by the price people are willing to pay) more than it costs to produce that additional unit. To remedy this inefficiency and move towards the point where P = MC, more of the good should be produced.\n\n-   **Increase in Production:** By increasing the production and supply of the good, the market moves towards the allocatively efficient quantity.\n-   **Decrease in Price:** According to the law of demand, as the quantity of a good supplied to the market increases, its price will fall (moving down along the demand curve).\n-   **Convergence of P and MC:** As production increases, the marginal cost of production will typically rise (due to the law of diminishing marginal returns), and the price will fall. This process continues until the rising MC meets the falling P, at which point P = MC and allocative efficiency is achieved.\n\nTherefore, an increase in production, which leads to a decrease in price, is the mechanism that remedies the situation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: decrease production, decrease price**\nDecreasing production would move the market further away from allocative efficiency. When P > MC, it signals that not enough of the good is being produced. Reducing output would cause the price to rise (due to lower supply) and marginal cost to fall, widening the gap between P and MC and worsening the under-allocation of resources.\n\n**B: decrease production, increase price**\nThis option correctly identifies that decreasing production would lead to a higher price. However, decreasing production is the wrong course of action. As explained above, the condition P > MC indicates under-production, so the remedy is to increase, not decrease, the quantity produced.\n\n**D: increase production, increase price**\nWhile increasing production is the correct action to address the under-allocation, it will not typically lead to an increase in price. Assuming a standard downward-sloping demand curve, increasing the quantity supplied to the market will cause the equilibrium price to decrease, not increase. The goal is to close the gap between P and MC; increasing production causes P to fall and MC to rise until they meet."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_11.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "11 the diagram shows an industry\u2019s demand for and supply of labour.\nwage\nrate is}\ni _,\n[e) x \u00a5 zz\nnumber\nof workers\n\ninitially, the labour market is in equilibrium. the government introduces a minimum wage of ow.\nwhat will be the effect on the level of employment in the industry?\na adecrease equal to xy\nb  adecrease equal to xz\nc_ anincrease equal to xy\nd_anincrease equal to yz", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe initial equilibrium in the labour market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S).

Market X has more specific skills and training requirements than Y.**\n\nThe gradient of the supply curve for labour indicates its wage elasticity. A steeper supply curve, as seen for Market X, signifies a more wage-inelastic supply of labour. This means that a change in the wage rate leads to a proportionally smaller change in the quantity of labour supplied.\n\nThis inelasticity is primarily determined by the mobility of labour and the time required to acquire the necessary qualifications for a job. If a profession in Market X requires extensive, specialised training and specific skills (e.g., surgeons, architects), the pool of qualified workers is limited. Even if wages rise significantly, the supply of labour cannot increase quickly because it takes a long time for new individuals to complete the required education and training. Consequently, the quantity of labour supplied is not very responsive to changes in the wage rate, resulting in a steep, inelastic supply curve.\n\nIn contrast, the flatter supply curve for Market Y suggests a more wage-elastic supply. This is characteristic of labour markets where jobs require fewer specific skills and minimal training. A small increase in the wage rate can attract a large number of workers from other occupations or from unemployment, causing a significant increase in the quantity of labour supplied.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Market X has a higher marginal revenue product per worker than Y.**\n\nThe marginal revenue product (MRP) of labour is the additional revenue generated by employing one more worker (MRP = MPP x MR). The MRP curve represents the firm's demand curve for labour. While it is likely that workers in a highly skilled market (like X) have a higher MRP, this factor determines the position and slope of the *demand* curve for labour, not the *supply* curve. The supply curve is determined by the willingness and ability of workers to offer their labour at different wage rates.\n\n**B. Market X has a higher percentage of its labour belonging to a trade union than Y.**\n\nWhile trade unions can influence the labour market, their presence does not inherently explain the steepness of the underlying market supply curve in this manner. A powerful trade union might negotiate a single wage rate, making the supply curve perfectly elastic (horizontal) at that wage up to the number of members willing to work. Alternatively, by restricting the entry of new workers (e.g., through a closed shop), a union can make the supply of labour more inelastic. However, the fundamental reason for the inelasticity in a skilled profession is the lengthy training and qualifications required, a factor that exists independently of unionisation. Option D provides a more direct and fundamental explanation for the natural elasticity of supply for that type of labour.\n\n**C. Market X has higher labour costs as a percentage of total costs than X.**\n\nAssuming this option intends to compare Market Y and Market X (e.g., \"Market Y has higher labour costs... than X\"), this factor is a determinant of the price elasticity of *demand* for labour, not supply. When labour costs form a large proportion of a firm's total costs, the demand for that labour tends to be more wage-elastic. This is because a rise in wages would significantly increase the firm's total costs, forcing it to reduce the quantity of labour demanded more substantially. This relates to the employer's hiring decisions (demand), not the workers' supply decisions."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_13.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "13 the table shows the main characteristics of employment in two occupations.\npf ereraton x [eceaton |\naverage annual wage $100 000 $60 000\nnumber of weeks of annual leave 5 weeks 10 weeks\naverage length of working week 48 hours 44 hours\njob security low high\nlength of training course to obtain job qualification 1 year 2 years\nwhat can definitely be deduced from the table?\na_ those employed in occupation y attach greater importance to job security.\nb_ those employed in occupation x attach less importance to leisure activities.\nc_ there will be more competition for places on training courses to enter occupation x than\noccupation y.\nd occupation y has more non-pecuniary advantages than occupation x.", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nNon-pecuniary advantages are the non-monetary benefits associated with a job. Pecuniary advantages relate to monetary compensation, primarily the wage.\n\n1.  **Pecuniary Comparison:** Occupation X offers a significantly higher average annual wage ($100,000) than Occupation Y ($60,000). This is a clear pecuniary advantage for Occupation X.\n2.  **Non-Pecuniary Comparison:**\n    *   **Annual Leave:** Occupation Y offers 10 weeks of leave, double the 5 weeks offered by Occupation X. This is a non-pecuniary advantage for Y.\n    *   **Working Week:** Occupation Y has a shorter average working week (44 hours) compared to Occupation X (48 hours). This means more leisure time per week, a non-pecuniary advantage for Y.\n    *   **Job Security:** Occupation Y offers high job security, whereas Occupation X has low job security. This is a significant non-pecuniary advantage for Y.\n\nBased on a direct comparison of the non-wage factors provided, Occupation Y is superior in terms of leave, working hours, and security. Therefore, it can be definitely deduced from the table that Occupation Y has more non-pecuniary advantages than Occupation X. The higher wage in Occupation X can be seen as a **compensating wage differential**, which is the additional income required to attract workers to a job with less desirable non-pecuniary characteristics.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Those employed in occupation Y attach greater importance to job security.**\n\nThis statement cannot be definitely deduced. The table provides objective data about the characteristics of the jobs, not the subjective preferences or motivations of the individuals employed in them. While workers in Occupation Y do benefit from high job security, we cannot conclude that this specific factor was the primary reason for their choice. They may have been more attracted by the 10 weeks of annual leave or the shorter working week. Without information on worker preferences, any conclusion about the importance they attach to specific job aspects is an assumption, not a deduction.\n\n**B: Those employed in occupation X attach less importance to leisure activities.**\n\nThis is an invalid deduction for the same reason as option A. While employees in Occupation X have objectively less leisure time (longer work week, less annual leave), this does not necessarily mean they value leisure less. It is more likely that they are making a rational economic trade-off, willingly forgoing some leisure time in exchange for a substantially higher annual wage ($40,000 more than Occupation Y). Their choice simply reveals that, for them, the utility gained from the extra income outweighs the utility lost from having less leisure. It does not allow us to deduce the absolute importance they place on leisure.\n\n**C: There will be more competition for places on training courses to enter occupation X than occupation Y.**\n\nThis is a plausible hypothesis but cannot be definitely deduced from the table. The level of competition for training places is determined by the interaction of demand for and supply of those places. The table shows that Occupation X is attractive due to its high wage and shorter training period, which would likely increase the *demand* for its training courses. However, the table provides no information about the *supply* of training places for either occupation. If the number of available training places for Occupation X is vast, while the number for Occupation Y is very limited, competition could actually be higher for Occupation Y.

This means that individuals with higher incomes pay a larger percentage of their income in tax. A fall in direct tax rates, particularly if it benefits higher income brackets, reduces the tax burden on the wealthy more than on the poor. This lessens the redistributive effect of the tax system, leading to a wider gap in disposable income between high and low earners and thus increasing income inequality.\n\n*   **Rise in Indirect Taxes:** Indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, are levied on goods and services. These taxes are generally regressive, meaning they take a larger proportion of income from lower-income households than from higher-income households. This is because poorer households tend to spend a larger percentage of their total income on essential goods and services that are subject to these taxes. An increase in indirect taxes, therefore, places a disproportionately heavy burden on the poor, reducing their real disposable income and widening the inequality gap.\n\nWhen both policies are implemented simultaneously, their effects compound, leading to a significant increase in the inequality of income distribution.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: fall in direct taxes, fall in indirect taxes**\nThis combination has conflicting effects on income inequality. A fall in direct taxes tends to increase inequality by reducing the progressivity of the tax system. However, a fall in indirect taxes tends to decrease inequality, as it provides greater relief (in proportional terms) to lower-income households who spend a larger fraction of their income on taxed goods and services. The net effect on inequality is ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitude of the changes.\n\n**C: rise in direct taxes, fall in indirect taxes**\nThis combination of policies is likely to *decrease* income inequality, which is the opposite of the outcome in question. A rise in progressive direct taxes would increase the tax burden on higher earners, redistributing income away from them. A fall in regressive indirect taxes would provide more proportional relief to lower-income households. Both actions work to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n**D: rise in direct taxes, indirect taxes remain constant**\nThis policy would likely *decrease* income inequality. A rise in progressive direct taxes would increase the tax burden on higher-income individuals, reducing their disposable income relative to lower-income individuals.

This lowers their costs of production, enabling them to reduce fares for consumers. Public transport and private car use are substitute goods. A decrease in the price of public transport makes it a more attractive and affordable alternative to driving. Consequently, commuters are likely to switch from using their cars to using public transport, which directly leads to a reduction in the use of cars in cities.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Decreasing parking charges would make it cheaper to use a car in the city. Parking is a complementary good to car travel in urban areas. By reducing the cost of parking, the overall cost of a car journey into the city falls. This would create an incentive for more people to drive, increasing the demand for car use and working against the government's objective.\n\n**B:** Lowering the tax on petrol (gasoline) would reduce the price of fuel.

An increase in the budget deficit occurs when the gap between spending and revenue widens. This happens if spending rises, revenue falls, or both occur simultaneously.\n\nThe combination of circumstances in option B is the most likely to cause an increase in the budget deficit for the following reasons:\n1.  **Decrease in total GDP:** A decrease in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) signifies a contraction in economic activity. This leads to lower corporate profits and household incomes, which in turn reduces the government's tax revenue from corporation tax, income tax, and consumption taxes (like VAT). A fall in revenue, holding spending constant, will increase a deficit.\n2.  **Rise in unemployment:** Higher unemployment has a direct impact on both government spending and revenue. As more people become unemployed, government expenditure on unemployment benefits and other social welfare payments automatically increases. This is a form of an 'automatic stabilizer'. Furthermore, unemployed individuals no longer pay income tax, further reducing government revenue.\n3.  **No change in government spending:** This refers to discretionary government spending (e.g., on infrastructure, defence, education). If this component of spending remains unchanged while automatic spending on benefits is rising and tax revenues are falling, the overall effect is a significant widening of the budget deficit.\n\nTherefore, the combination of falling tax revenues (due to lower GDP and higher unemployment) and rising government spending (due to higher unemployment benefit payments) with no offsetting cut in discretionary spending creates the strongest pressure for the budget deficit to increase.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A:** This option includes a decrease in total GDP and a rise in unemployment, which both contribute to a larger deficit by reducing tax revenue and increasing welfare spending, respectively. However, it also includes a decrease in government spending. This decrease in discretionary spending would counteract the deficit-increasing pressures. Depending on the magnitude of the spending cut, the deficit might not increase, or could even decrease. Thus, this combination is less likely to lead to an increase in the deficit than option B.\n\n*   **C:** This option describes a situation where GDP increases and unemployment falls.

These are 'automatic stabilizers' that work to *reduce* the budget deficit.

The net outcome is uncertain and less likely to be an increase in the deficit compared to option B.\n\n*   **D:** In this scenario, GDP increases and unemployment falls, while discretionary government spending remains unchanged.

A commercial bank operates as a for-profit entity. Its main goal is to generate profits for its shareholders by providing financial services, such as accepting deposits and making loans, and earning a margin on the interest rate spread. Conversely, a central bank is a public institution that does not have a profit-maximising objective. Its primary mandates are to maintain macroeconomic stability, which includes controlling the money supply, ensuring price stability (managing inflation), overseeing the banking system, and acting as the government's banker. While a central bank might generate income (known as seigniorage), this is a consequence of its operations, not its core purpose. Therefore, the statement that a central bank does not maximise profit while a commercial bank does is correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** The issuance of bank notes is a sovereign function exclusively held by the central bank. The central bank has a monopoly on the printing and distribution of the nation's legal tender.

In a developed economy, where growth is primarily driven by improvements in efficiency and technology rather than the accumulation of basic factors of production, a more skilled workforce leads to higher labour productivity. Increased productivity means that more output can be generated from the same amount of labour input, causing a rightward shift in the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve. This represents genuine, sustainable economic growth, as it increases the economy's potential output without relying on temporary demand-side stimuli. Investment in human capital through training fosters innovation and allows the economy to adapt to and develop new technologies, ensuring growth can be maintained over the long term.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a movement of people from rural to urban areas**\nThis type of structural change, where labour moves from a low-productivity agricultural sector to higher-productivity manufacturing and service sectors, is a major source of economic growth in *developing* countries. However, in a developed economy, this process has largely already taken place. The agricultural sector is typically small and highly mechanised, and the majority of the population already resides in urban areas. Therefore, any further movement of people from rural to urban areas would have a marginal, rather than a significant, impact on overall economic growth.\n\n**C. an increase in the size of the population**\nWhile an increase in population can expand the labour force and thus increase the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it does not guarantee sustainable economic growth or an increase in living standards. Sustainable growth is more closely associated with an increase in GDP *per capita*. A simple increase in population, without a corresponding increase in the capital stock or improvements in technology and skills, can lead to diminishing marginal returns to labour, potentially lowering average productivity and GDP per capita. In developed economies, growth in productivity (output per worker) is far more important than growth in the number of workers.\n\n**D. rising consumer credit levels**\nRising consumer credit fuels an increase in consumption, which boosts Aggregate Demand (AD). This can lead to short-run economic growth, as the economy moves to a higher level of output along its Short-Run Aggregate Supply curve. However, this is a demand-side phenomenon and does not increase the economy's long-run productive potential (the LRAS). Growth based on increasing debt is often unsustainable. It can create inflationary pressure if the economy is near full capacity and may lead to financial instability and a painful correction in the future if households become over-leveraged. It does not represent a sustainable increase in the economy's ability to produce goods and services."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_20.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "20 which policy is likely to increase unemployment?\na_anincrease in retraining facilities\nb_asignificant increase in indirect taxes\nc_ the imposition of selective import controls\nd_anincrease in the public sector deficit", "Chapter": 25, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA significant increase in indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, is a contractionary fiscal policy that is likely to increase unemployment. This occurs through two main channels. Firstly, it raises the costs of production for firms, which can be illustrated by a leftward (inward) shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. This leads to cost-push inflation. Secondly, these higher costs are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of consumers, leading to a fall in consumption, a key component of aggregate demand (AD). The combination of reduced aggregate supply and reduced aggregate demand leads to a contraction in real national output (GDP). As firms scale back production in response to lower demand and higher costs, their demand for labour falls, resulting in an increase in cyclical (demand-deficient) unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. an increase in retraining facilities**\n\nThis policy is designed to *decrease* unemployment, specifically structural unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills held by the unemployed and the skills demanded by employers. An increase in retraining facilities is a supply-side policy that aims to improve the occupational mobility of the labour force by equipping workers with new, more relevant skills. By making the workforce more adaptable to changes in the structure of the economy, this policy helps to reduce the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n**C. the imposition of selective import controls**\n\nThis policy, a form of protectionism, is generally intended to *decrease* unemployment in the short term. Import controls, such as tariffs or quotas, make imported goods more expensive or less available. This encourages domestic consumers and firms to switch their expenditure from foreign goods to domestically produced substitutes. The resulting increase in demand for domestic goods leads firms to expand their production, which in turn increases the derived demand for domestic labour, thereby reducing unemployment in the protected industries.\n\n**D. an increase in the public sector deficit**\n\nAn increase in the public sector deficit (where government spending exceeds tax revenue) typically results from an expansionary fiscal policy. This can be achieved by increasing government spending or cutting taxes. Both actions lead to an increase in aggregate demand (AD). Higher government spending is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, while tax cuts increase the disposable income of households and firms, boosting consumption and investment. The rise in aggregate demand encourages firms to increase their output, leading to a higher demand for labour and thus a *decrease* in cyclical unemployment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_21.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "21 what does the accelerator principle state?\na consumption is a function of the rate of change of income.\nb_ income is a function of the rate of change of investment.\nc investment is a function of the rate of change of income.\nd_ investment is a function of the rate of interest.", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe accelerator principle posits a direct relationship between the net investment of firms and the rate of change of national income or output. According to this theory, when national income is growing, there is a corresponding increase in the demand for consumer goods and services. To meet this higher demand, firms need to expand their productive capacity by purchasing more capital goods (machinery, equipment, factories). This expenditure on new capital goods is known as induced investment. Therefore, the level of net investment is determined not by the absolute level of income, but by the speed at which income is changing (\u0394Y). If income growth accelerates, investment will rise. Conversely, if income growth slows, stalls, or declines, net investment will fall, potentially becoming negative (disinvestment).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Consumption is a function of the rate of change of income.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the accelerator principle specifically explains the determinants of induced investment, not consumption. Theories of consumption, such as the Keynesian consumption function, typically state that consumption is a function of the *level* of disposable income (C = a + bYd), not its rate of change.\n\n**B: Income is a function of the rate of change of investment.**\nThis misrepresents the relationship between income and investment. The concept that a change in investment leads to a change in income is known as the **multiplier effect**, where \u0394Y = k \u00d7 \u0394I (a change in investment causes a multiplied change in income). The accelerator principle describes the reverse causation: a change in income (\u0394Y) induces a change in the level of investment (I). This option incorrectly links the level of income to the *rate of change* of investment, which aligns with neither the multiplier nor the accelerator theory.\n\n**D: Investment is a function of the rate of interest.**\nThis statement describes the standard Keynesian theory of investment, not the accelerator principle. In the Keynesian model, investment is inversely related to the rate of interest. Firms are assumed to undertake investment projects as long as the expected rate of return (the Marginal Efficiency of Capital) is greater than or equal to the cost of borrowing (the rate of interest). While the interest rate is a key determinant of investment, the accelerator principle provides an alternative explanation, focusing on the change in national income as the primary driver of induced investment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_22.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "22 which government aim is least likely to be achieved using macroeconomic monetary policy\nmeasures?\na low unemployment level\nbmore equal income distribution\nc stable exchange rate\nd steady price level", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA more equal distribution of income is an objective primarily addressed through fiscal policy and supply-side policies, not monetary policy. Fiscal measures, such as progressive income tax systems and targeted welfare payments (e.g., unemployment benefits, housing support), directly redistribute income from higher earners to lower earners. Supply-side policies, like implementing a national minimum wage or investing in education and training, aim to increase the earning potential of low-skilled workers.\n\nMonetary policy, which involves managing interest rates and the money supply, is a blunt instrument that is not designed to target specific income groups. While its effects can have distributional consequences, they are often indirect and ambiguous. For instance, expansionary monetary policy (lower interest rates) may reduce unemployment, which benefits lower-income households. However, it also tends to inflate asset prices (e.g., stocks and property), which disproportionately benefits wealthier households who own these assets. Therefore, monetary policy is an unreliable and inappropriate tool for achieving a more equal income distribution.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. low unemployment level**\n\nMonetary policy is a key tool for influencing the level of unemployment. By implementing expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering the central bank's policy rate, the cost of borrowing for consumers and firms is reduced. This stimulates consumption and investment, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. As aggregate demand rises, firms increase production, which in turn increases the demand for labour, thereby reducing cyclical unemployment. This transmission mechanism makes monetary policy a direct and effective instrument for pursuing the goal of low unemployment.\n\n**C. stable exchange rate**\n\nMonetary policy has a direct and significant impact on a country's exchange rate. A central bank can raise interest rates to attract foreign financial investment (hot money flows). This increases the demand for the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market, causing it to appreciate. Conversely, lowering interest rates can lead to capital outflows and a depreciation of the currency. Central banks can also engage in direct intervention by buying or selling their currency in the foreign exchange market. Because of these powerful channels, monetary policy is a principal tool used to manage and stabilise the exchange rate.\n\n**D. steady price level**\n\nAchieving a steady price level, or low and stable inflation, is the primary objective of most modern central banks. This is the core function of monetary policy. To combat inflation, a central bank can implement contractionary monetary policy by raising interest rates. This increases the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving, which dampens consumer spending and business investment. The resulting decrease in aggregate demand helps to alleviate demand-pull inflationary pressures, thus stabilising the price level. This makes monetary policy the main instrument for inflation control."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_23.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "23 a government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy to increase the economic growth rate.\nwhich other main macroeconomic aims is this policy most likely to help?\nfull stable current account\nemployment price level surplus\na v jv x\nb x v v\ncc x x v\nd v x x", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "An expansionary fiscal policy involves the government increasing its spending and/or reducing taxation to stimulate economic activity. The primary mechanism is an increase in aggregate demand (AD).\n\n**Analysis of Macroeconomic Aims:**\n\n*   **Full Employment:** An increase in aggregate demand encourages firms to expand production to meet the higher demand for goods and services. To increase output, firms will need to hire more labour, which directly reduces cyclical unemployment. Therefore, an expansionary fiscal policy helps move the economy closer to its goal of full employment.\n\n*   **Stable Price Level:** The rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve, which drives economic growth and employment, also puts upward pressure on the general price level. As the economy approaches full capacity, resources become scarcer, leading to higher costs of production and resulting in demand-pull inflation. This outcome is in direct conflict with the objective of maintaining a stable price level.\n\n*   **Current Account Surplus:** Expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher national income. As incomes rise, a portion of this additional income is spent on imported goods and services, determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPM). The increase in import spending (M) worsens the current account balance (X-M), moving it towards a deficit or reducing an existing surplus. Furthermore, the resulting domestic inflation can make exports less price-competitive and imports more attractive, further deteriorating the current account position. Consequently, this policy is unlikely to help achieve a current account surplus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe expansionary fiscal policy is most likely to help achieve the aim of full employment. However, it creates a conflict with the aims of a stable price level (due to inflation) and a current account surplus (due to rising imports and reduced export competitiveness)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_24.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "24 country x decides to devalue its currency to eliminate a balance of payments deficit.\nwhy might devaluation have a positive effect on its macroeconomy?\na_ competitive pricing of exports may create employment potential in country x.\nb_ foreign importers may depreciate their own currencies and reduce any advantage gained by\ncountry x.\nc inelastic demand for imported raw materials may lead to cost inflation in country x.\nd loss of import duties by country x may reduce government backing for trade promotion.", "Chapter": 30, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA currency devaluation lowers the external value of a country's currency. This makes its exports cheaper for foreign buyers and its imports more expensive for domestic consumers. The improved price competitiveness of exports is likely to increase the quantity demanded by foreign countries. To meet this rising external demand, domestic producers in export-oriented industries will need to increase their production levels. This expansion in output typically requires hiring more labour, thereby increasing employment or creating the potential for it. The resulting rise in net exports (X-M) also increases aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)), leading to economic growth and lower unemployment, which are positive macroeconomic effects.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Foreign importers may depreciate their own currencies and reduce any advantage gained by country X.**\nThis statement describes a potential negative consequence or limitation of a devaluation policy, not a positive effect. If trading partners retaliate by devaluing their own currencies (a practice known as competitive devaluation), the initial price advantage gained by Country X will be eroded or eliminated. This would nullify the intended positive impact on Country X's exports and balance of payments, making it an undesirable outcome.\n\n**C: Inelastic demand for imported raw materials may lead to cost inflation in country X.**\nThis statement highlights a significant negative effect of devaluation. Devaluation increases the domestic price of all imported goods, including essential raw materials and components used in production. If the domestic demand for these imported inputs is price-inelastic (meaning firms cannot easily find domestic substitutes and must continue buying them), their costs of production will rise. Firms are likely to pass these higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices, leading to cost-push inflation. Inflation is generally considered a negative macroeconomic outcome as it erodes real incomes and can create economic instability.\n\n**D: Loss of import duties by country X may reduce government backing for trade promotion.**\nThis statement describes a negative fiscal effect. Devaluation raises the price of imports, which typically leads to a fall in the quantity of imports demanded. A reduction in the volume of imports will, in turn, reduce the government's revenue from any import duties (tariffs) it imposes.

An innovation, such as a more efficient manufacturing technique or a new software, increases the productivity of existing capital and labour. This means more output can be produced from the same amount of inputs. For the present generation, this leads to higher incomes, lower prices, and/or better quality goods and services. For future generations, the knowledge gained is a non-depleting resource that can be built upon, leading to a permanently higher potential for economic output and improved living standards. While there are initial costs associated with research and development (R&D), the long-term benefits typically far outweigh these costs and are shared across generations.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. increased exploitation of a country's mineral resources**\nThis method of achieving economic growth imposes significant costs, particularly on future generations. Mineral resources are finite and non-renewable. Increased exploitation today means fewer resources will be available for future generations, potentially constraining their economic development. Furthermore, intensive resource extraction often leads to environmental degradation, such as pollution and habitat destruction, which creates negative externalities and long-term costs that both present and future populations must bear.\n\n**B. investment financed by borrowing from abroad**\nWhile foreign borrowing can finance investment and stimulate short-term growth without reducing current consumption, it creates a liability for future generations. The principal and interest on the foreign debt must be repaid. This means that a portion of the country's future national income will have to be transferred abroad to service the debt, reducing the resources available for consumption and investment for future generations. This represents a direct transfer of wealth from the future to the present.\n\n**C. investment financed by high rates of domestic savings**\nThis path to growth imposes a significant opportunity cost on the present generation. To achieve high rates of domestic savings, the current population must forgo present consumption.

A more equitable distribution of income is a key objective and indicator of economic development. This is not captured by simple GDP growth figures.\n*   **Level of poverty:** A reduction in absolute and relative poverty is a fundamental goal of economic development.

The curve shows the relationship between a measure of economic inequality (such as the Gini coefficient) on the vertical axis and a measure of economic development (such as income per capita) on the horizontal axis. In the early stages of development, as a country shifts from agriculture to industry, the wage gap between rural and urban workers widens, increasing inequality.

It plots tax revenue on the vertical axis and the tax rate on the horizontal axis.

It is not an indicator of economic development because it provides no information about the standard of living, well-being, or economic productivity per person. A country can have a very large population but a low level of economic development (e.g., low average income, poor health outcomes, and low educational attainment). Conversely, a country with a small population can be highly developed. Economic development focuses on the quality of life and economic welfare of the average citizen, which is better assessed using per capita indicators. Therefore, population size is the least likely metric to be used for comparing the economic development of different economies.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. mean years of schooling**\nThis is a key indicator of human capital and is frequently used to measure economic development. Mean years of schooling reflects the average educational attainment of the adult population.

It provides a summary of mortality patterns and reflects the quality of public health, nutrition, and sanitation within a country.

An increase in tariff rates is a prime example of such a policy. A tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. By increasing tariffs, the government raises the price of imports relative to the price of domestically produced goods. This change in relative prices incentivises consumers to switch their expenditure away from the more expensive foreign goods and towards the relatively cheaper domestic alternatives. The primary goal is typically to improve the current account of the balance of payments by reducing imports.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: an increase in income tax rates**\nThis is an example of an **expenditure-reducing** (or expenditure-dampening) policy, not an expenditure-switching one. An increase in income tax rates reduces the disposable income of households. This leads to a decrease in overall consumption and, consequently, a fall in aggregate demand. While this will likely cause a reduction in spending on imports, it also reduces spending on domestic goods. The policy's primary effect is to lower the total level of expenditure in the economy, rather than to alter the choice between domestic and foreign goods based on their relative prices.\n\n**B: an increase in interest rates**\nThis is a contractionary monetary policy and is another example of an **expenditure-reducing** policy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for both consumers and firms, and increase the incentive to save. This leads to a reduction in consumption and investment spending, thereby lowering overall aggregate demand. Similar to an income tax hike, this reduces total spending on both domestic and imported goods, rather than encouraging a switch between them. Furthermore, higher interest rates can attract foreign financial investment (\"hot money\"), leading to an appreciation of the domestic currency, which would make imports cheaper and exports more expensive\u2014the opposite of what an expenditure-switching policy aims to achieve.\n\n**D: an increase in the supply of money**\nThis is an expansionary monetary policy and is an example of an **expenditure-increasing** policy. An increased money supply typically leads to lower interest rates, which stimulates consumption and investment, thus increasing aggregate demand. This policy is designed to boost the overall level of spending in the economy. While an expansionary monetary policy might lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate (which is a mechanism for expenditure-switching), the direct action of increasing the money supply is aimed at raising total expenditure, not switching its composition.

With more workers available, the economy can produce a greater volume of goods and services, leading to an increase in potential and actual economic growth.\n\nSimultaneously, this migration increases the supply of labour in the high-income country's labour market. According to the principles of supply and demand, an increase in the supply of labour (a rightward shift of the labour supply curve), ceteris paribus, puts downward pressure on the equilibrium wage rate. Even if nominal wages do not fall (due to wage stickiness or minimum wage laws), the increased availability of workers reduces labour shortages and weakens the bargaining power of existing labour.

Marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer gains from consuming one more unit of a good or service.

The second pair of socks, while still useful (perhaps as a spare or for another day), provides less *additional* satisfaction than the first pair because the initial, most urgent need has already been met. Therefore, the marginal utility of the second pair is lower than that of the first, representing a decrease in marginal utility.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in marginal productivity**\n\nThis option is incorrect because marginal productivity is a concept from the theory of production, not consumer behaviour. Marginal productivity (or marginal product) measures the additional output generated by adding one more unit of a factor of production, such as labour or capital, while holding other inputs constant. The scenario describes an act of consumption (buying socks), not production.

It incorrectly omits the marginal private benefit (MPB) of $20,000, which must be included to determine the full marginal social benefit.\n\n**C: $80,000**\nThis value represents the total external benefit (TEB) that arises from the consumption of 5,000 units. This is a total, not a marginal, figure. Marginal benefit refers to the additional benefit from the last unit consumed, not the cumulative benefit from all units.\n\n**D: $380,000**\nThis value represents the total social benefit (TSB) from consuming 5,000 units, calculated by adding the total private benefit ($300,000) and the total external benefit ($80,000).

This increased efficiency leads to economies of scale. By combining operations, the new, larger firm can benefit from technical economies (e.g., using larger, more specialised equipment), managerial economies (e.g., employing specialist managers over a larger output), and purchasing economies (e.g., bulk-buying raw materials at lower prices). Furthermore, a merger allows for the rationalisation of resources and the elimination of duplicated functions (such as two separate marketing departments or administrative headquarters), which lowers the firm's total costs, and consequently its average costs of production.\n\n*   **Demand Curve:** Before the merger, the two firms were competitors. For consumers, the product from one firm was a close substitute for the product from the other. The availability of close substitutes is a primary determinant of price elasticity of demand; when many substitutes exist, demand is relatively elastic. After the merger, a competitor is eliminated, reducing the number of close substitutes available to consumers. This reduction in consumer choice means that demand for the merged firm's product will become more price inelastic. Consumers will be less responsive to a price increase as they have fewer alternative suppliers to turn to.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: fall / more elastic\n\nWhile it is correct that average costs are expected to fall due to efficiency gains and economies of scale, it is incorrect to assume the demand curve becomes more elastic. A merger reduces the number of competing firms in the market, thereby decreasing the number of substitutes available to consumers. A reduction in substitutes makes demand less, not more, sensitive to price changes, leading to a more inelastic demand curve.\n\n#### C: rise / more elastic\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. Firstly, the premise of the merger is to increase efficiency, which implies a reduction, not a rise, in average costs through economies of scale and elimination of duplicated roles. Secondly, as the merger reduces market competition and the number of substitutes, the demand curve for the merged firm's product would become more inelastic, not more elastic.\n\n#### D: rise / more inelastic\n\nWhile this option correctly identifies that the demand curve will become more inelastic due to reduced competition, it incorrectly states that average costs will rise. A merger undertaken for reasons of efficiency is expected to lead to economies of scale and other cost savings, causing the average cost of production to fall.

Dynamic efficiency refers to the rate of investment in new technologies and innovative processes over time, which leads to lower long-run average costs and improved product quality.\n\nFirms in perfect competition are unable to achieve dynamic efficiency for two primary reasons:\n1.  **Lack of Supernormal Profits:** In the long run, free entry and exit ensure that firms in perfect competition can only earn normal profits. They do not earn the sustained supernormal profits that are typically required to fund costly, long-term research and development (R&D).\n2.  **Lack of Incentive:** Due to the assumption of perfect information, any innovation by one firm (e.g., a new, cost-saving production technique) would be immediately known and copied by all other firms in the market. The innovating firm would not be able to gain a significant or lasting competitive advantage, and any short-term supernormal profits would be competed away almost instantly. This removes the financial incentive to undertake the risks and costs of R&D.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. oligopoly**\nAn oligopolistic market structure is often considered highly conducive to dynamic efficiency. Firms in an oligopoly are able to earn significant and sustained supernormal profits due to high barriers to entry. These profits provide the financial resources (the ability) to invest heavily in R&D. Furthermore, the intense, non-price competition that characterises oligopolies creates a strong incentive to innovate. Firms innovate to differentiate their products, lower their costs, and gain a competitive edge over their few, powerful rivals.\n\n**B. monopolistic competition**\nWhile firms in monopolistic competition only earn normal profits in the long run (limiting their ability to fund large-scale R&D), there is still a strong incentive for innovation. The core feature of this market is product differentiation. Firms constantly engage in small-scale innovation, such as changes in design, branding, and service, to make their products appear unique and to capture short-run supernormal profits. This continuous drive to differentiate means that some degree of dynamic efficiency is more likely to occur than in perfect competition, where products are homogenous.\n\n**C. monopoly**\nA monopoly has the greatest potential for dynamic efficiency, according to the Schumpeterian hypothesis. A monopolist can earn substantial supernormal profits in the long run due to formidable barriers to entry. These profits provide the necessary funds for investment in R&D. The incentive to innovate exists to lower costs, increase profits further, and develop new products that can solidify the firm's market dominance and act as a further barrier to entry.

This is often due to asymmetric information, where the agent has more information about their own actions than the principal. To overcome this, the principal must create an incentive structure that aligns the agent's goals with their own. Linking workers' pay to the firm's profits, through mechanisms like profit-sharing or bonuses, directly achieves this. When employees' earnings increase as the firm's profits rise, they are motivated to work harder, be more innovative, and act in the best financial interests of the firm. This alignment of financial incentives bridges the gap between the interests of the principal and the agent.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. increasing monthly salaries of waiters in a restaurant to decrease their dependence on tips from customers**\n\nThis action is more likely to worsen the principal-agent problem. Tips are a form of performance-related pay where customers (acting on behalf of the principal, the restaurant owner) reward good service. This system incentivises waiters (agents) to provide excellent service to maximise their income, which aligns with the owner's goal of customer satisfaction and repeat business. By increasing the fixed salary and reducing the importance of tips, the direct link between a waiter's effort and their reward is weakened. This reduces the financial incentive to provide superior service, potentially leading to a decline in performance (shirking).\n\n**C. making full fee payment in advance to a lawyer to motivate him to prepare a legal case well**\n\nThis scenario exacerbates the principal-agent problem due to moral hazard. Once the agent (the lawyer) has received full payment, the financial incentive to exert maximum effort and achieve the best outcome for the principal (the client) is significantly diminished. The lawyer's income is secure regardless of the quality of their subsequent work or the result of the case. This disconnect between performance and reward can lead to the agent under-performing, as the cost of doing so is low. A more effective contract would link payment to successful outcomes or milestones (e.g., a contingency fee).\n\n**D. offering permanent contracts to give workers job security**\n\nWhile job security can have positive effects on employee morale and loyalty, it can also entrench the principal-agent problem. A key tool that principals have to ensure agents work diligently is the threat of dismissal for poor performance. A permanent contract weakens this tool, reducing the negative consequences of shirking for the employee. With their job secure, an employee may have less incentive to maintain a high level of productivity, knowing that it is difficult for the employer to terminate their contract. This can lead to a divergence between the employee's desire for a comfortable work-life and the employer's goal of maximising output."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_39.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "9 company r manufactures steel. company s produces ships. company t operates oil tankers.\ncompany v operates cruise liners.\nwhich statement is correct?\na_ if r takes over s, this is an example of forwards vertical integration.\nb if s takes over v, this is an example of backwards vertical integration.\nc_ if t takes over s, this is an example of diversification.\nd_ if v takes over s, this is an example of horizontal integration.", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nForwards vertical integration occurs when a firm merges with or acquires another firm that is at a later stage in the same supply chain, i.e., closer to the final consumer. In this scenario, Company R manufactures steel, which is a key input for Company S, a ship producer. The supply chain can be visualized as: Steel Production (R) \u2192 Ship Production (S) \u2192 Ship Operation (T and V).\n\nWhen Company R (steel producer) takes over Company S (ship producer), it is integrating with a business that is further 'forward' in the supply chain. This move allows the steel company to secure a buyer for its product and gain more control over the distribution or use of its primary output. Therefore, this is a correct example of forwards vertical integration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. If S takes over V, this is an example of backwards vertical integration.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Backwards vertical integration involves acquiring a firm at an earlier stage of the supply chain. Company S produces ships, and Company V operates cruise liners (a type of ship). Thus, Company S is a supplier to Company V. If S were to take over V, it would be moving forward in the supply chain, from manufacturing a product to providing a service with that product. This is an example of forwards vertical integration, not backwards. Backwards vertical integration would occur if Company V took over Company S.\n\n**C. If T takes over S, this is an example of diversification.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Diversification, or conglomerate integration, is the merger of firms in entirely unrelated industries. Company T operates oil tankers, and Company S produces ships. Since oil tankers are a type of ship, these two companies operate in the same overall industry and are linked in the same supply chain (S is a supplier to T). When T (the customer) takes over S (the supplier), it is an example of backwards vertical integration, as T is securing its supply of a critical asset. It is not diversification because the two businesses are directly and vertically related.\n\n**D. If V takes over S, this is an example of horizontal integration.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Horizontal integration is the merger of two firms that are at the same stage of production in the same industry (i.e., they are competitors). Company V operates cruise liners (a tertiary sector service), while Company S produces ships (a secondary sector manufacturing activity). As they operate at different stages of the supply chain, their merger cannot be horizontal. A merger between V and S would be an example of backwards vertical integration, where the service provider (V) acquires its supplier (S)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_40.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "10 there are two firms in an industry. firm x faces a choice. it can either act independently or work\nwith its rival. if it acts independently its profit could be $900 a week but it could be only $400 a\nweek depending on what its rival does. if it works with its rival the joint profit of the two firms\ntogether would be $1400, $700 each. it has no knowledge of what the rival\u2019s policy will be.\n\nwhich concept describes this situation?\na_ contestable market\n\nb_ kinked demand curve\n\nc principal agent problem\nd_prisoner\u2019s dilemma", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe situation described is a classic example of the **prisoner's dilemma**, a fundamental concept in game theory that is often used to analyse the behaviour of firms in an oligopoly.\n\n1.  **Interdependence:** The profits of Firm X depend not only on its own decision (to act independently or to work with its rival) but also on the decision made by its rival. This interdependence is a hallmark of oligopolistic markets.\n2.  **Conflict between Individual and Collective Interest:** The best collective outcome for the two firms is to work together (collude), as this yields the highest joint profit of $1400 ($700 each). However, there is a strong individual incentive for each firm to cheat on this agreement.\n3.  **Incentive to Defect (Act Independently):** If Firm X believes its rival will honour the agreement to collude, Firm X can increase its own profit from $700 to $900 by acting independently.\n4.  **Dominant Strategy:** Acting independently is the dominant strategy for Firm X.\n    *   If the rival colludes, Firm X is better off acting independently ($900 > $700).\n    *   If the rival also acts independently, Firm X is still better off having acted independently ($400 is better than the outcome of being the sole cooperator, which would be even lower).\n5.  **Sub-optimal Nash Equilibrium:** Since both firms face the same payoffs and incentives, both will rationally choose to act independently. This leads to an outcome where both earn $400. This is a Nash equilibrium because, given the rival's choice, neither firm can improve its position by unilaterally changing its strategy. However, this outcome ($400 each) is worse for both firms than the cooperative outcome ($700 each).\n\nThis dilemma, where rational self-interest leads to a collectively worse result, is the essence of the prisoner's dilemma.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Contestable Market:** A contestable market is characterised by zero barriers to entry and exit, meaning there are no sunk costs. The key feature is that the *threat* of new entrants forces incumbent firms to behave competitively (e.g., set prices low and earn only normal profit), regardless of the number of firms actually in the market. The scenario provided describes the strategic interaction between two existing incumbent firms, not the influence of potential new entrants.\n\n**B) Kinked Demand Curve:** The kinked demand curve is a model used to explain price stability in oligopolistic markets. It assumes that rivals will match a price decrease but not a price increase, creating a \"kink\" in the firm's demand curve. While this model also deals with oligopolistic interdependence, it is a specific theory about price rigidity. The question presents a more general strategic choice problem with discrete payoffs, which is the direct structure of a game theory matrix, specifically the prisoner's dilemma, rather than the continuous price-output relationship described by the kinked demand curve model.\n\n**C) Principal-Agent Problem:** The principal-agent problem arises from a conflict of interest and asymmetric information between a principal (e.g., a company's owner/shareholder) and an agent who makes decisions on their behalf (e.g., a manager).

It should impose an indirect tax on consumers, to reduce consumption to the socially efficient level.**\n\nA negative externality in consumption occurs when the consumption of a good imposes costs on third parties. This means the social marginal benefit (MSB) of consumption is less than the private marginal benefit (MPB). In a free market, consumers only consider their private benefits and costs, leading to over-consumption of the good relative to the socially optimal level.\n\nImposing an indirect tax (a Pigouvian tax) is the standard market-based solution. The tax increases the price of the good for consumers. This forces consumers to \"internalise the externality,\" meaning the price they pay now reflects not just the private cost of production but also the external cost imposed on society. This higher price reduces the quantity demanded, moving consumption down from the market equilibrium to the socially efficient level, where MSB equals the social marginal cost (MSC). This action corrects the market failure and eliminates the deadweight welfare loss associated with over-consumption.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It should provide information about the undesirable side-effects of the good.**\n\nThis policy addresses a different type of market failure: information failure or asymmetric information. It assumes that consumers over-consume because they are unaware of the full *private* costs to themselves (e.g., health risks). While providing information might reduce demand, it does not directly address the *external* cost\u2014the cost imposed on third parties. Even fully informed consumers might choose to ignore the negative impact their consumption has on others. Therefore, while potentially helpful, it is less direct and likely less effective at correcting the externality than a tax that forces all consumers to account for the external cost.\n\n**B. It should give producers a subsidy, to allow consumers to purchase the product more cheaply.**\n\nA subsidy is a payment from the government that lowers the cost of production and, subsequently, the market price of a good. This policy would encourage *more* consumption, not less. Since a negative externality is characterised by over-consumption, a subsidy would worsen the market failure by moving the level of consumption further away from the socially efficient outcome. Subsidies are used to correct positive externalities, where a good is under-consumed in the free market.\n\n**D. It should not interfere at all, to allow the free market to generate maximum efficiency.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the presence of a negative externality signifies a market failure. In such a case, the free market does *not* generate maximum efficiency. The price mechanism fails to account for the full social costs of consumption, leading to an overallocation of resources to the production and consumption of the good. This results in a deadweight welfare loss to society. Government intervention, in the form of a corrective tax or regulation, is necessary to guide the market towards a more socially efficient outcome."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_42.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "12 a government decides to replace a private company with its own company to collect household\nwaste.\nwhy could such action be justified?\na_ waste collection is a public good.\nb_ costs of waste collection are bound to be lower if paid out of local taxes.\nc_ private companies are always less efficient than government companies.\nd_ private companies might put profits before customer needs.", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nPrivate companies are driven by the profit motive. This can create a conflict with the public interest, especially in the provision of essential services like waste collection. A private firm might attempt to increase profits by reducing costs in ways that negatively affect service quality. For example, it could reduce the frequency of collections, use poorly maintained vehicles that cause pollution, or neglect less-profitable areas. The government, not being driven by profit, may decide to provide the service itself to ensure a certain standard of quality, reliability, and coverage for all citizens, thereby prioritising public health and environmental needs over commercial gain. This represents a normative judgement by the government that the social benefits of a high-quality service outweigh the potential efficiency gains from private provision.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Waste collection is a public good.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect based on the economic definition of a public good. A public good must be both non-rivalrous (consumption by one person does not prevent consumption by another) and non-excludable (it is not possible to prevent non-payers from benefiting). Waste collection is **rivalrous** because once a truck has collected waste from one house, its capacity (time and space) to collect from another is diminished. It is also **excludable** because a company can refuse to collect waste from a household that has not paid for the service. Therefore, waste collection is technically a private good, although it is often treated as a merit good due to the significant positive externalities (e.g., public health, sanitation) associated with its universal provision.\n\n**B. Costs of waste collection are bound to be lower if paid out of local taxes.**\n\nThis is a fallacious argument. The method of funding (direct payment vs. payment through taxes) does not inherently change the underlying costs of production, which include labour, capital (trucks), fuel, and disposal fees. While government provision might achieve economies of scale, it could also suffer from inefficiencies (known as X-inefficiency) due to a lack of competitive pressure and the profit motive. There is no guarantee that costs are \"bound to be lower\" under public provision; they could potentially be higher.\n\n**C. Private companies are always less efficient than government companies.**\n\nThis is an incorrect generalisation. Economic theory often suggests the opposite. The profit motive and the pressures of competition can drive private firms to be more productively efficient, meaning they have a strong incentive to minimise costs for a given level of output. Government-run enterprises may lack these incentives, potentially leading to higher costs and lower efficiency.

While it may be intended to protect domestic industries, it raises the price of imported goods for consumers. This price increase also allows domestic producers of competing goods to raise their prices. Tariffs tend to be regressive, as they disproportionately affect lower-income households who spend a larger percentage of their income on basic goods. An increase in the Gini coefficient signifies a rise in income inequality. Therefore, if a tariff leads to a more unequal distribution of income (a higher Gini coefficient), it represents an unintended and negative consequence of government policy, which is a form of government failure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This describes a successful government intervention, not a failure. Cigarette consumption generates negative externalities (e.g., costs to the healthcare system, harm from passive smoking), leading to their over-consumption in a free market. An indirect tax (a Pigouvian tax) equal to the value of the external cost is the textbook solution to internalise this externality. The resulting fall in demand indicates the policy is working as intended to move consumption closer to the socially optimal level, thereby correcting the market failure.\n\n**B:** This describes a successful government intervention. Powerful trade unions can sometimes act as a barrier to labour mobility and create labour market rigidities, leading to inefficiency. By placing limits on a union's restrictive practices, the government aims to make the labour market more flexible and efficient. An increase in labour mobility is a positive outcome that addresses a market imperfection, indicating a successful policy, not a failure.\n\n**C:** This describes the removal of a government intervention, not a new intervention that has failed. Price controls (such as a price ceiling on bread) are a form of government intervention that can lead to government failure by creating shortages (excess demand), black markets, and inefficient resource allocation. Removing these controls allows the price mechanism to function freely, moving the market towards an equilibrium that better reflects supply and demand. This action is a correction of a potential prior government failure, not an example of a new one."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_44.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "14 what would shift the marginal revenue product curve for workers producing electric vehicles to\nthe right?\na adecrease in the price of petrol vehicles\nb adecrease in the productivity of electric vehicles workers\nc_anincrease in the price of electric vehicles\nd_anincrease in the wage rate of electric vehicles workers", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe marginal revenue product (MRP) of labour is the additional revenue generated by employing one more worker. It is calculated as the worker's marginal physical product (MPP) multiplied by the marginal revenue (MR) from selling the output (MRP = MPP x MR). The MRP curve represents the firm's demand for labour.\n\nA rightward shift in the MRP curve indicates an increase in the demand for labour, meaning the firm is willing to hire more workers at any given wage rate. This occurs if either the workers' productivity (MPP) or the revenue generated from their output (MR) increases.\n\nAn increase in the price of electric vehicles directly increases the marginal revenue (MR) the firm receives from selling each vehicle. Consequently, the value of the output produced by each worker rises. This increases the MRP at every level of employment, causing the MRP curve for these workers to shift to the right.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a decrease in the price of petrol vehicles**\n\nPetrol vehicles are a substitute good for electric vehicles. A decrease in the price of a substitute good will lead to a decrease in the demand for electric vehicles. This reduction in demand will, in turn, lower the price and thus the marginal revenue (MR) of electric vehicles. A lower MR reduces the marginal revenue product (MRP) of the workers producing them, causing the MRP curve to shift to the left, not the right.\n\n**B: a decrease in the productivity of electric vehicles workers**\n\nA decrease in the productivity of workers means that their marginal physical product (MPP) has fallen.

In a perfectly competitive labour market, the firm is a wage-taker, so the marginal cost of labour is the market wage rate (W). The marginal revenue generated by an additional worker is the Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRPL). The profit-maximisation condition for hiring labour is therefore **W = MRPL**.\n\nThe MRPL is calculated as the Marginal Product of Labour (MPL) multiplied by the price (P) of the output. For a perfectly competitive firm in the product market, the price is constant. Consequently, the MRPL curve has the same shape as the MPL curve. The firm's demand for labour is represented by the downward-sloping portion of its MRPL curve.\n\nFollowing this rule:\n-   At the given wage rate W, we look for the point where the horizontal wage line intersects the MPL (acting as the MRPL) curve. This occurs at two employment levels: N\u2081 and N\u2083.\n-   The firm will not choose N\u2081 because at any point to the right of N\u2081, the MPL is greater than the wage W. This means that hiring additional workers would add more to revenue than to costs, thus increasing profit. The firm, therefore, has an incentive to expand employment beyond N\u2081.\n-   The profit-maximizing quantity is N\u2083. At this level, W = MPL. If the firm were to hire one more worker (beyond N\u2083), the MPL would be less than the wage W, meaning the additional worker would cost more than the revenue they generate, leading to a fall in profit. Thus, the firm will employ ON\u2083 workers.\n-   Furthermore, for a firm to employ any labour at all, the wage must not exceed the Average Revenue Product (ARP). At N\u2083, the wage W is below the APL curve, meaning the average revenue per worker (ARP) is greater than the wage, confirming that employing ON\u2083 workers is profitable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. ON\u2081:** At an employment level of ON\u2081, the wage (W) is equal to the MPL. However, this is not a profit-maximizing equilibrium because the MPL curve is upward sloping at this point. For any quantity of labour greater than N\u2081, the MPL is higher than W. This indicates that the firm can increase its total profit by hiring more workers, as each additional worker adds more to revenue than to cost. Therefore, the firm will not stop hiring at ON\u2081.\n\n**B. ON\u2082:** At an employment level of ON\u2082, the Marginal Product of Labour (MPL) is at its maximum. At this point, the MPL is significantly greater than the wage rate W. Since the marginal revenue from hiring an additional worker (MRPL) is greater than the marginal cost (W), the firm will continue to hire more workers to increase its profits. Profit is maximized where W = MPL, not where MPL is at its peak.\n\n**D. ON\u2084:** At an employment level of ON\u2084, the Marginal Product of Labour (MPL) is below the wage rate W. This means that the last worker hired adds less to the firm's revenue than to its costs (MRPL < W). A profit-maximizing firm would not employ this worker. Instead, it would reduce its workforce from ON\u2084 back towards ON\u2083 to increase its profits, as it would be shedding workers who cost more than they contribute to revenue."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_46.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "16 which change is likely to result in a decrease in the demand for money?\na adecrease in the use of credit cards by consumers\nb_aswitch from monthly to weekly payments of wages\nc_ adecrease in interest rates\nd_anincrease in the perceived risks involved in holding government bonds", "Chapter": 26, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe demand for money refers to the desire of individuals and firms to hold financial assets in the form of money (cash or bank deposits) rather than other assets like bonds. One of the primary reasons for holding money is the **transactions motive**, which is the need to have cash available for day-to-day purchases.\n\nA switch from monthly to weekly wage payments means that individuals receive their income more frequently. Consequently, the average cash balance they need to hold to cover their expenses between pay periods decreases. For example, a person paid monthly must hold enough money to last the entire month, resulting in a higher average cash balance. If the same person is paid the same total income but in weekly instalments, they only need to hold enough cash for one week's expenses at a time. This reduces their average money holdings. Aggregated across the entire economy, this change in payment frequency leads to a decrease in the overall transactions demand for money.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in the use of credit cards by consumers**\n\nThis change would lead to an **increase**, not a decrease, in the demand for money. Credit cards are a close substitute for cash for transaction purposes. If consumers decrease their use of credit cards, they must rely more on physical money (cash and demand deposits) to facilitate their purchases. This would raise the transactions demand for money.\n\n**C. a decrease in interest rates**\n\nThis change would lead to an **increase**, not a decrease, in the demand for money. The nominal interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding money. Money held as cash or in non-interest-bearing accounts does not generate a return, whereas alternative assets like bonds do. When interest rates fall, the return from holding these alternative assets decreases, thus lowering the opportunity cost of holding money. As it becomes \"cheaper\" to hold money, the quantity of money demanded for speculative or asset purposes increases.\n\n**D. an increase in the perceived risks involved in holding government bonds**\n\nThis change would lead to an **increase**, not a decrease, in the demand for money. Money is considered the most liquid and least risky financial asset. Government bonds are an alternative asset in which to hold wealth. If the perceived risk associated with holding bonds increases (e.g., due to fears of default or price instability), individuals and investors will shift their portfolios away from the riskier asset (bonds) and towards the safer asset (money).

This is often caused by long-term changes in the economy, such as technological advancements, shifts in consumer demand, or increased foreign competition. To reduce structural unemployment, policies must either protect jobs in declining sectors or facilitate the creation of new jobs and help workers transition to them.\n\n*   **An increase in tariffs:** Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. By making imports more expensive, they protect domestic industries from foreign competition. This can slow or prevent the decline of certain industries, thereby preserving jobs for workers whose skills are specific to those sectors. This directly addresses structural unemployment caused by the shifting of production overseas.\n*   **Lower taxes for new businesses:** This is a supply-side policy that incentivises entrepreneurship and investment. By reducing the tax burden, the government encourages the creation of new firms, which in turn leads to the creation of new jobs. These new jobs can absorb workers who have been displaced from other industries, thus reducing the overall level of structural unemployment.\n\nThe combination of protecting existing jobs in vulnerable industries and stimulating the creation of new jobs provides a two-pronged approach to decreasing structural unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a fall in inflation and an increase in lending for low income households**\nThese policies primarily target aggregate demand. A fall in inflation is a general macroeconomic objective and does not directly address the skills mismatch characteristic of structural unemployment. An increase in lending to low-income households would boost consumption and aggregate demand, which is effective at reducing cyclical unemployment (unemployment due to economic downturns), but not structural unemployment. Workers would still lack the required skills for the jobs available, even in a growing economy.\n\n**B: a fall in real wages and an increase in subsidies for technological improvements**\nThis combination is unlikely to reduce structural unemployment and may even worsen it. Subsidies for technological improvements accelerate the pace at which technology replaces labour and makes certain skills obsolete, which is a primary cause of structural unemployment. While a fall in real wages could make hiring cheaper for firms, it does not solve the underlying problem that unemployed workers do not have the skills that firms, especially technologically advancing ones, are looking for.\n\n**D: the introduction of a national minimum wage and better working conditions**\nThese measures tend to increase the cost of labour for firms. The introduction of a national minimum wage, if set above the market equilibrium, acts as a price floor and can lead to an increase in real-wage unemployment as firms reduce the quantity of labour they demand. Similarly, imposing better working conditions can increase non-wage costs for businesses.

The NRU consists of frictional and structural unemployment. Strong trade unions, through collective bargaining, can negotiate wage rates that are above the market-clearing equilibrium level. When the wage rate is artificially maintained above the equilibrium, the quantity of labour supplied by workers exceeds the quantity of labour demanded by firms. This creates an excess supply of labour, resulting in real-wage unemployment, which is a form of structural unemployment. Therefore, a country with more powerful and widespread trade unions is likely to experience higher real-wage unemployment, leading to a higher overall natural rate of unemployment compared to a country with weaker unions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. There is more training and education in X.**\nInvestment in training and education is a supply-side policy intended to *reduce* the natural rate of unemployment. By enhancing the skills, productivity, and adaptability of the workforce, training and education help to diminish structural unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills workers possess and the skills employers require. A better-educated and trained labour force is less susceptible to such mismatches, making it easier for workers to find employment, thus lowering the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n**C. There are greater incentives to find work in X.**\nGreater incentives to find work, such as lower unemployment benefits or stricter eligibility criteria for those benefits, are designed to *reduce* the natural rate of unemployment. Such measures increase the opportunity cost of remaining unemployed, encouraging individuals to search for jobs more actively and accept available positions more quickly. This reduces the duration of unemployment spells, thereby lowering frictional unemployment and, consequently, the overall natural rate of unemployment.\n\n**D. There is a higher level of job vacancy information in X.**\nAn improvement in the availability and quality of information about job vacancies acts to *reduce* the natural rate of unemployment. Frictional unemployment exists because of imperfect information in the labour market; it takes time for job seekers to find suitable vacancies and for employers to find suitable candidates. A higher level of job vacancy information, perhaps through online job portals or government employment agencies, makes the matching process between workers and firms more efficient.

When a currency is revalued, it becomes \"stronger.\" This means that one unit of the domestic currency can now purchase more units of a foreign currency.\n\nThe primary cause of inflation in this scenario is a rapid rise in import prices (imported inflation). A revaluation directly counters this by making imported goods and raw materials cheaper in domestic currency terms. For example, if a country revalues its currency, it will cost less for its citizens and firms to buy goods priced in foreign currencies. This reduction in the cost of imports lowers the production costs for firms that rely on foreign inputs and also reduces the price of imported consumer goods. This has the effect of shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the right (or mitigating a leftward shift), which leads to a decrease in the general price level, thereby reducing cost-push inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. a decrease in the domestic rate of interest**\nThis is an expansionary monetary policy. Lowering the domestic interest rate is intended to stimulate aggregate demand (AD) by making borrowing cheaper for consumers and firms. An increase in AD would put upward pressure on the price level, leading to demand-pull inflation, which would exacerbate the existing inflationary problem. Furthermore, lower interest rates can lead to an outflow of financial capital, causing the domestic currency to depreciate. A weaker currency would make imports even more expensive, worsening the imported inflation.\n\n**B. a decrease in the rate of income tax**\nThis is an expansionary fiscal policy. Reducing income tax increases households' disposable income, which typically leads to higher consumption and an increase in aggregate demand (AD). Just like lowering interest rates, boosting AD in an already inflationary environment would likely worsen the situation by adding demand-pull pressure on top of the existing cost-push inflation. This policy does not address the root cause of the problem, which is the high cost of imports.\n\n**C. an increase in trade tariffs on imports**\nA tariff is a tax levied on imported goods. Increasing tariffs would directly raise the price of these imports for domestic consumers and firms. This policy would, therefore, intensify the very problem it is meant to solve.

The balance of payments is a systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of a country and the residents of foreign countries over a period of time. It includes the current account (trade in goods and services, income flows) and the capital and financial accounts (flows of investment). By definition, a closed economy has no such external transactions. Therefore, the concept of a balance of payments, and any objective related to it such as achieving a surplus or deficit, is entirely irrelevant and does not apply.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. achieving a low and steady rate of inflation**\nThis objective is incorrect because controlling inflation is a fundamental domestic macroeconomic goal, irrespective of an economy's openness. Inflation refers to the rate of increase in the general price level within a country. High or volatile inflation can distort economic decisions, erode the real value of savings, and create uncertainty, harming both consumers and producers. A government in a closed economy would still need to manage its domestic money supply and aggregate demand to maintain price stability.\n\n**B. achieving a more equal income distribution**\nThis objective is incorrect because the distribution of income and wealth is an internal, or domestic, policy issue. It concerns how the national income is shared among the country's own citizens. Governments use fiscal policy tools, such as progressive taxation and transfer payments (e.g., welfare benefits), to influence this distribution. The decision to pursue a more equitable distribution of income is independent of whether an economy engages in international trade.\n\n**D. achieving a sustainable rate of economic growth**\nThis objective is incorrect because economic growth is a primary goal for all economies, whether open or closed.

This combination has distinct effects on the government's main macroeconomic objectives.\n\n*   **Higher Economic Growth:** This is **more likely**. The increase in government spending (G) is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, which increases Aggregate Demand (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)). This rise in AD leads to an increase in real GDP, signifying short-run economic growth. Furthermore, spending on infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, communications) improves the productive capacity of the economy. This enhances efficiency, reduces costs for firms, and shifts the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right, promoting long-term economic growth.\n\n*   **Lower Unemployment:** This is **more likely**. The increase in Aggregate Demand leads to a higher level of national output. To meet this increased demand, firms will hire more workers, reducing demand-deficient (cyclical) unemployment. Additionally, the infrastructure development projects themselves are typically labour-intensive, creating a direct increase in the demand for labour and generating new jobs.\n\n*   **Lower Inflation:** This is **less likely**. The policy is highly inflationary. The rightward shift in the AD curve, caused by increased government spending, creates demand-pull inflation as the economy's total spending outpaces its production capacity. More importantly, financing the deficit by printing money (monetisation of debt) directly increases the money supply. According to the Quantity Theory of Money, a significant increase in the money supply without a proportional increase in real output will lead to a rise in the general price level, i.e., inflation. Therefore, achieving the objective of lower inflation is highly improbable; in fact, higher inflation is the expected outcome.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: less likely, less likely, more likely**\nThis option is incorrect. Both higher economic growth and lower unemployment are *more likely* outcomes of an expansionary fiscal policy involving infrastructure spending, as it boosts both aggregate demand and creates jobs. Furthermore, financing government spending by printing money is a primary cause of inflation, making the objective of *lower inflation* much *less likely*, not more likely.\n\n**B: less likely, more likely, less likely**\nThis option incorrectly states that higher economic growth is less likely. Increased government spending on infrastructure is a key tool for stimulating economic activity. It directly contributes to GDP and also enhances the economy's long-run productive potential, making higher growth a probable outcome. While the predictions for unemployment and inflation are correct, the initial premise regarding economic growth is flawed.\n\n**D: more likely, more likely, more likely**\nThis option is incorrect because it suggests that all three objectives are more likely to be achieved simultaneously. There is a well-established short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation (the Phillips Curve).

Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms. This discourages spending on credit (consumption) and reduces business investment in new capital. Furthermore, higher interest rates increase the incentive for households to save rather than spend. The combined effect of lower consumption and investment leads to a decrease in aggregate demand. A fall in aggregate demand results in a lower level of real output (real GDP) and a slower rate of economic growth.

An increase in a country's interest rates tends to cause an **appreciation** of its currency. Higher interest rates offer a greater return on financial assets, such as government bonds and savings accounts. This attracts foreign investors seeking higher yields, leading to an inflow of foreign capital (often termed \"hot money\"). To invest in the country, these foreign investors must first purchase its currency, thereby increasing the demand for the currency on the foreign exchange market. An increase in demand for a currency causes its value to rise, which is an appreciation, not a depreciation.\n\n**B: a fall in the level of savings**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in interest rates raises the reward for saving. When households place their money in savings accounts, they receive a higher return. This makes saving more attractive relative to consumption. As a result, rational economic agents are incentivised to save more of their disposable income to take advantage of the higher returns. Therefore, an increase in interest rates is expected to lead to a **rise**, not a fall, in the overall level of savings in the economy.\n\n**D: a reduction in unemployment**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in interest rates leads to a slowdown in economic activity. As aggregate demand falls due to lower consumption and investment, firms will reduce their production levels. The demand for labour is a derived demand, meaning it depends on the demand for the goods and services that labour produces. With lower output, firms will require fewer workers, leading to layoffs and a reduction in new hiring. This causes an **increase** in cyclical unemployment. This relationship illustrates the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, often depicted by the Phillips Curve."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_54.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "24 the diagram shows the relationship between the income tax rate and tax revenue.\ntax | | ner\nrevenue |\no zz y\nincome tax rate\n\nwhich statement is correct?\na_ a tax rate cut from y to z will cause tax revenue to decrease.\nb_ at tax rates below z a tax rate cut will cause tax revenue to increase.\nc_ the greater the rate of tax beyond z, the smaller will be the tax revenue generated.\nd_ tax revenue will always increase as the rate of income tax increases.", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\n### Explanation of Correct Answer\n\nThe diagram illustrates the Laffer curve, which shows a theoretical relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. The point Z on the horizontal axis represents the revenue-maximising tax rate. Beyond this point, any further increase in the tax rate leads to a decrease in tax revenue. This is because excessively high tax rates can create strong disincentives for individuals and firms to work, save, and invest. As a result, the tax base (the total amount of income subject to tax) shrinks to such an extent that it outweighs the effect of the higher rate, causing total tax revenue to fall. Therefore, the statement that the greater the rate of tax beyond Z, the smaller the tax revenue generated, is a correct interpretation of the downward-sloping portion of the Laffer curve.\n\n### Explanations of Incorrect Answers\n\n**A.** A tax rate cut from Y to Z represents a movement from a higher, less efficient tax rate to the optimal, revenue-maximising rate. On the diagram, moving from tax rate Y to tax rate Z corresponds to an increase in tax revenue from level W to level X. The tax cut stimulates economic activity, expands the tax base, and thus increases total tax revenue. Therefore, the statement that this tax cut will cause revenue to decrease is incorrect.\n\n**B.** The region of the curve below the tax rate Z (from O to Z) is the upward-sloping portion. In this range, an increase in the tax rate leads to an increase in tax revenue, as the positive effect of the higher rate on revenue is greater than the negative disincentive effect on the tax base. Conversely, a tax rate cut in this region (moving from Z towards O) would cause a decrease in tax revenue. The statement that a tax cut will cause revenue to increase is only true for the region beyond Z, not below it.\n\n**D.** This statement is incorrect because it contradicts the fundamental concept of the Laffer curve. While tax revenue does increase as the tax rate rises from zero, this relationship only holds up to the optimal rate Z. Beyond point Z, the relationship is inverted: further increases in the tax rate lead to decreases in tax revenue.

If domestic firms rely on these imported inputs and cannot switch to locally produced alternatives, they are forced to absorb these higher costs. To maintain their profit margins, these firms will pass the increased costs of production onto consumers in the form of higher prices for finished goods and services. This phenomenon is known as cost-push inflation. The unavailability of local substitutes for imported raw materials makes this inflationary pressure particularly severe, as firms have no alternative but to pay the higher import prices, directly feeding into the domestic price level.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. Excess capacity is available.**\nThe availability of excess capacity in an economy tends to dampen inflationary pressures. A devaluation typically stimulates aggregate demand (AD) by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thus increasing net exports. If an economy has significant excess capacity (i.e., unemployed labour and underutilised capital), an increase in AD can be met by increasing output without a substantial rise in the general price level. The aggregate supply curve is relatively elastic in this range. Therefore, this situation makes inflation *less* likely, not more likely.\n\n**B. Import tariffs are reduced.**\nImport tariffs are taxes levied on imported goods, which raise their domestic price. A reduction in these tariffs would lower the cost of imports. This effect would directly counteract the price-increasing effect of a currency devaluation. By making imports cheaper than they otherwise would have been post-devaluation, a reduction in tariffs would help to mitigate cost-push inflation, rather than cause it.\n\n**D. The demand for exports is price inelastic.**\nA devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper in foreign currency terms. If the demand for these exports is price inelastic (Price Elasticity of Demand < 1), a decrease in their price will lead to a less than proportionate increase in the quantity demanded. This means that the resulting increase in export volumes, and therefore the stimulus to aggregate demand, will be relatively small. A weak increase in aggregate demand is unlikely to cause significant demand-pull inflation. For a devaluation to have a strong inflationary effect via the demand channel, the demand for exports would need to be price elastic."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_56.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "26 a country imports most of the raw materials used as factor inputs.\nwhich policy is most likely to control cost-push inflation?\na anappreciation of the exchange rate\nb_anincrease in the rate of income tax\nc_anincrease in the rate of interest\nd_anincrease in the rate of sales tax", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nCost-push inflation occurs when the overall price level rises due to increases in the costs of production, leading to a decrease in aggregate supply (a leftward shift of the SRAS curve). The question specifies that the country is a major importer of raw materials, which are key factor inputs. Therefore, the cost of these imports is a significant driver of production costs.\n\nAn appreciation of the exchange rate means the domestic currency has increased in value relative to foreign currencies. This makes imports cheaper in domestic currency terms. For a country that relies on imported raw materials, a stronger currency directly reduces the cost of these essential inputs for domestic producers. This reduction in production costs alleviates the pressure that causes cost-push inflation, either by preventing a leftward shift of the SRAS curve or by causing a rightward shift, thereby stabilising or reducing the price level.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. an increase in the rate of income tax**\nAn increase in the rate of income tax is a contractionary fiscal policy tool. Its primary effect is to reduce the disposable income of households, which in turn reduces consumption and aggregate demand (AD). While reducing aggregate demand can help control demand-pull inflation (inflation caused by excess AD), it does not address the root cause of cost-push inflation, which is rising production costs. Applying this policy could lead to stagflation\u2014a combination of rising prices (from the cost-push pressures) and rising unemployment (from the fall in AD).\n\n**C. an increase in the rate of interest**\nAn increase in the rate of interest is a contractionary monetary policy. It works by making borrowing more expensive for consumers and firms, thereby reducing consumption and investment spending, which lowers aggregate demand. Similar to an increase in income tax, this policy is primarily designed to combat demand-pull inflation. It does not directly tackle the rising costs on the supply side that are causing cost-push inflation. While higher interest rates might attract foreign capital and cause the currency to appreciate (the effect in option A), this is an indirect and less certain outcome. The primary and intended effect is the reduction of aggregate demand.\n\n**D. an increase in the rate of sales tax**\nAn increase in the rate of sales tax (an indirect tax) would be counterproductive in controlling cost-push inflation. A sales tax is treated as a cost of production by firms. Increasing this tax raises firms' costs, which they will likely pass on to consumers through higher prices. This would shift the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve further to the left, thus worsening cost-push inflation rather than controlling it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_57.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_m24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "27 germany, one of the world\u2019s strongest trading nations, achieved a surplus on current account of\nthe balance of payments in 2021-2022.\nwhich income flow would not have been included in the calculation of germany\u2019s current\naccount?\na_ declining sales of german cars for export overseas.\nb_ falling earnings of foreign exchange from visitors to germany.\nc increasing transfers of aid to less developed countries.\nd_ investment in a natural gas pipeline link to its main foreign supplier.", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn investment in a natural gas pipeline represents a long-term acquisition of a physical asset in another country.

Declining sales of German cars for export overseas.**\nThe sale of physical goods, such as cars, to other countries is recorded under the **trade in goods** section of the current account.

This intervention is typically aimed at preventing excessive volatility, achieving specific economic objectives, or keeping the exchange rate within a target range or band. The description of maintaining the rate \"within a narrow but changing band\" precisely matches this system. The \"narrow band\" signifies intervention, while the \"changing band\" reflects the flexibility of the float, distinguishing it from a rigid fixed system. The central bank adjusts its target band over time in response to changing economic conditions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. fixed**\nA **fixed exchange rate** system involves a country pegging its currency's value to another currency (a 'hard peg') or a basket of currencies at a pre-determined rate. The monetary authority is committed to maintaining this specific rate and will intervene to buy or sell its currency whenever the market rate deviates. While a very small band of fluctuation may be permitted, the core feature is the commitment to a constant, unchanging central parity rate. The phrase \"changing band\" contradicts the fundamental principle of a fixed exchange rate system, which is based on stability and a non-changing target.\n\n**B. floating**\nA **floating exchange rate** (or flexible exchange rate) is a system where a currency's value is determined purely by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, with no direct intervention from the central bank.

The currencies in the basket are weighted according to their relative importance in the country's international trade.

The straight diagonal line represents perfect equality, where each percentile of households holds the same percentile of total income or wealth. The further a Lorenz curve bows away from this line of perfect equality, the greater the degree of inequality in the distribution.\n\nThe initial condition states that income is more equally distributed than wealth. This means the initial Lorenz curve for income must be closer to the line of perfect equality than the initial Lorenz curve for wealth. The problem then describes two changes: the distribution of income becomes more unequal, and the distribution of wealth becomes more equal.\n\n1.  **Distribution of Income:** The change from a more equal to a more unequal distribution is represented by a shift of the Lorenz curve *away* from the line of perfect equality. The shift from curve 1 to curve 2 shows such a movement.\n2.  **Distribution of Wealth:** The change from a more unequal to a more equal distribution is represented by a shift of the Lorenz curve *towards* the line of perfect equality.

Economic development facilitates greater investment in healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and medical technology. Access to sanitation and clean water improves, significantly reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases. Higher per capita incomes enable better nutrition, which strengthens the immune system and reduces malnutrition-related illnesses. Furthermore, increased education levels, particularly for women, lead to better health and hygiene practices within families. These combined factors cause a substantial fall in mortality rates, especially infant and child mortality, and an increase in longevity, resulting in a higher average life expectancy. This rise is a fundamental indicator of a country's successful development.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A: A lower percentage of people will go to university.**\nThis is incorrect. Economic development is strongly correlated with an increase in human capital. As a country becomes more developed, both the government and private households have more disposable income to invest in education. Furthermore, a developed economy requires a more skilled and educated workforce to support its advanced industries, particularly in the tertiary (services) and quaternary (knowledge-based) sectors. This creates higher returns on investment in higher education, incentivising more people to attend university. Consequently, the percentage of the population with tertiary education typically rises, not falls, with development.\n\n**C: The rate of population growth will increase.**\nThis is incorrect. While early stages of development may see a temporary surge in population growth as death rates fall faster than birth rates, the long-term trend in developed countries is a *decrease* in the rate of population growth. The Demographic Transition Model illustrates that as a country develops, birth rates fall significantly. Key reasons for this include increased access to education and employment for women, greater availability of family planning services, urbanisation (which increases the cost of raising children), and a shift away from agrarian societies where large families were an economic asset. As birth rates fall to meet low death rates, the overall rate of natural population increase slows down, and in many highly developed countries, it may even become zero or negative.\n\n**D: The tertiary sector will decline in importance.**\nThis is incorrect. A defining feature of economic development is a structural transformation of the economy away from the primary sector (agriculture) and towards the secondary (manufacturing) and, ultimately, the tertiary (services) sector. As per capita incomes rise, the demand for services such as finance, healthcare, education, retail, and tourism tends to increase more than proportionally (i.e., services have a high-income elasticity of demand). In all developed economies, the tertiary sector constitutes the largest share of both GDP and employment.

When the quantity consumed increases from Y to Z, marginal utility is negative, which means total utility is decreasing.

In this context, rationality means that a consumer has a clear objective: to maximise their total satisfaction (or utility) from consumption, subject to the constraints of their income and the prices of goods. This satisfaction-maximising objective is a fundamental behavioural axiom that is held constant throughout the analysis. The entire model, which involves finding the point of tangency between the budget line and the highest attainable indifference curve, is predicated on the consumer consistently striving to achieve this goal. The theory does not consider a scenario where the consumer abandons this objective, as doing so would make their choices indeterminate and the model inapplicable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The consumer's income may change.**\nThis statement is compatible with indifference theory. While income is held constant to define a specific budget line and find a particular consumer equilibrium, a primary application of the model is to analyse the effects of changes in income. An increase or decrease in income leads to a parallel shift in the budget line, resulting in a new equilibrium point. Tracing these points allows economists to derive the income-consumption curve and Engel curves, which illustrate the relationship between income and the quantity demanded of a good.\n\n**C. The consumers may change their tastes and preferences.**\nThis statement is also compatible with indifference theory. A consumer's tastes and preferences are represented by their indifference map (the set of all their indifference curves). While these are assumed to be constant for any single equilibrium analysis, the framework can be used to compare different equilibria before and after a change in preferences. A change in taste would alter the shape and position of the indifference curves, leading the consumer to choose a new optimal bundle of goods even if income and prices remain unchanged.\n\n**D. The relative prices of products may change.**\nThis is a central element analysed within indifference theory. The relative prices of the two goods determine the slope of the budget line. A key purpose of the model is to examine how a rational consumer adjusts their consumption when the price of one good changes relative to another. This analysis involves pivoting the budget line and identifying the new equilibrium points. Connecting these points forms the price-consumption curve, from which an individual's demand curve can be derived. Therefore, the possibility of changing relative prices is fundamental to the theory's application."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_64.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "4 which type of efficiency is shown by the shift from long-run average cost curve 1 (lrac;) to\nlong-run average cost curve 2 (lrac2)?\n-\nlrac,\nlrac,\ns quantity\n\na allocative\n\nb dynamic\n\nc_ pareto\n\nd productive", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B dynamic\n\n**Explanation:**\nDynamic efficiency refers to improvements in productive efficiency that occur over time. It is achieved through investment in research and development, innovation in products, and improvements in production processes. The diagram illustrates a downward shift of the entire long-run average cost (LRAC) curve from LRAC\u2081 to LRAC\u2082. This shift indicates that the firm is now able to produce any given level of output at a lower average cost than before. Such a reduction in costs across all output levels is the result of technological advancements or process innovations, which are the core components of dynamic efficiency.\n\n### Incorrect Options\n\n**A allocative:**\nAllocative efficiency is achieved when resources are distributed in a way that maximizes societal welfare. The condition for allocative efficiency is that the price (P) of a good must equal its marginal cost (MC) of production. The diagram only shows long-run average cost curves and provides no information about the market price or the marginal cost. Therefore, it is not possible to assess allocative efficiency from the given information. The shift in the cost curve relates to production possibilities, not the market allocation of resources.\n\n**C Pareto:**\nPareto efficiency, or Pareto optimality, is a state of resource allocation where it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off. While the cost reduction shown by the shift from LRAC\u2081 to LRAC\u2082 could potentially lead to a Pareto improvement (e.g., if it results in lower prices for consumers without harming the producer), the concept of Pareto efficiency itself describes a static state of optimal allocation. The diagram illustrates the *process* of improvement over time, which is more specifically defined as dynamic efficiency.\n\n**D productive:**\nProductive efficiency occurs when a firm produces its output at the lowest possible cost per unit. In the long run, this is represented by producing at the minimum point of the long-run average cost curve. Productive efficiency, therefore, relates to a firm's position *on* a given LRAC curve. The diagram, however, shows a *shift* of the entire curve itself. This represents a fundamental improvement in the available technology or production methods, allowing for lower costs at all output levels.

Marginal revenue (MR) is the additional revenue generated from selling one more unit of output.\n\nMathematically, the maximum point of any function is found where its first derivative is equal to zero. The marginal revenue function is the first derivative of the total revenue function with respect to quantity (MR = dTR/dQ). Therefore, total revenue is maximised when marginal revenue is zero.\n\nIntuitively, as long as the marginal revenue from selling an additional unit is positive (MR > 0), producing and selling that unit will increase the firm's total revenue. The firm will continue to increase its output. However, if marginal revenue becomes negative (MR < 0), selling an additional unit will cause total revenue to fall. Consequently, the point at which total revenue is maximised is precisely where the revenue from the last unit sold is zero (MR = 0), just before it would turn negative.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. average cost = average revenue**\nThis condition signifies the break-even point for a firm. When average cost (AC) equals average revenue (AR), the firm's total cost is equal to its total revenue. At this output level, the firm is earning normal profit (zero economic profit), meaning it is covering all its explicit and implicit costs. This is not the condition for maximising revenue, but rather for achieving a specific level of profitability (zero economic profit).\n\n**B. marginal cost = average revenue**\nThis condition, where marginal cost (MC) equals average revenue (AR, which is also the price), is the point of allocative efficiency. It means the price consumers are willing to pay for the last unit is exactly equal to the cost of the resources used to produce that unit. While this is a significant point for analysing market efficiency and social welfare, it is not the condition a firm meets to maximise its own revenue.\n\n**C. marginal cost = marginal revenue**\nThis is the condition for profit maximisation, not revenue maximisation. Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost (TR - TC). A firm maximises its profit by producing at the quantity where the additional revenue from the last unit sold (marginal revenue) equals the additional cost of producing that last unit (marginal cost). Producing beyond this point would mean MC > MR, causing total profit to decrease.

This is because any revenue above variable costs can contribute to paying off fixed costs, which must be paid regardless of whether the firm produces or not. The condition to operate is TR \u2265 TVC.\n\n2.  **Long-Run Shutdown (Exit) Decision:** In the long run, all costs are variable, and a firm must cover its total costs (TC) to be profitable and remain in the market. Total cost is the sum of total variable cost and total fixed cost (TC = TVC + TFC). If a firm's total revenue is less than its total cost (TR < TC), it is making an economic loss and will exit the market.\n\nThe question asks for firms that operate in the short run (TR \u2265 TVC) but shut down in the long run (TR < TC). Let's analyze each firm:\n\n*   **Firm X:**\n    *   Short-run: TR ($80m) > TVC ($40m). The firm covers its variable costs, so it will continue to operate in the short run.\n    *   Long-run: TC = TVC + TFC = $40m + $50m = $90m. Since TR ($80m) < TC ($90m), the firm is making a loss and will shut down in the long run.\n    *   Firm X meets both criteria.\n\n*   **Firm Y:**\n    *   Short-run: TR ($500m) > TVC ($300m). The firm covers its variable costs, so it will continue to operate in the short run.\n    *   Long-run: TC = TVC + TFC = $300m + $300m = $600m. Since TR ($500m) < TC ($600m), the firm is making a loss and will shut down in the long run.\n    *   Firm Y also meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore, firms X and Y will continue to operate in the short run but will shut down in the long run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A: X and W:** This is incorrect because Firm W will shut down in the short run. Its total revenue ($15m) is less than its total variable cost ($20m). A firm will not operate, even in the short run, if it cannot cover its variable production costs.\n\n*   **C: W and Z:** This is incorrect because both Firm W and Firm Z will shut down in the short run. Firm W's TR ($15m) is less than its TVC ($20m), and Firm Z's TR ($550m) is less than its TVC ($600m). Neither firm would continue to operate.\n\n*   **D: Y and Z:** This is incorrect because Firm Z will shut down in the short run.

When the marginal value is less than the average value, it causes the average to decrease. In the context of production costs, the marginal cost (MC) is the cost of producing one additional unit, while the average variable cost (AVC) is the total variable cost divided by the number of units produced.\n\nIf the cost of the next unit produced (MC) is lower than the average variable cost of the units already produced (AVC), this new, lower-cost unit will pull the overall average down. Therefore, the condition that short-run marginal cost is less than short-run average variable cost (MC < AVC) necessarily implies that the average variable cost curve is downward-sloping, meaning AVC is falling. This occurs on the initial portion of the U-shaped AVC curve, before the point of minimum average variable cost where MC intersects AVC.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Average variable cost is constant.**\nFor the average variable cost to be constant, the cost of producing each additional unit (the marginal cost) would have to be exactly equal to the average variable cost (MC = AVC). This is not the case, as the information provided states that marginal cost is less than average variable cost.\n\n**C: Average variable cost is greater than its average total cost.**\nThis statement is impossible by definition. Average total cost (ATC) is calculated as the sum of average variable cost (AVC) and average fixed cost (AFC). Since fixed costs exist in the short run and are positive, the average fixed cost (AFC = TFC/Q) will always be a positive value. Therefore, ATC will always be greater than AVC (ATC = AVC + AFC). An average variable cost that is higher than the average total cost cannot occur.\n\n**D: Average variable cost is rising.**\nFor the average variable cost to be rising, the cost of producing the next unit (marginal cost) must be greater than the current average variable cost (MC > AVC).

Firstly, it reduces the number of substitutes available to consumers. The price elasticity of demand (PED) is heavily influenced by the availability of close substitutes. With one fewer major supplier in the market, consumers have less choice, making the demand for steel producer X's product less responsive to price changes (more inelastic). Therefore, the PED for its product will decrease. Secondly, the merger creates a larger firm. This increased scale of operation allows the firm to benefit from economies of scale. For example, it can engage in bulk-buying of raw materials (purchasing economies), rationalise its production by using the most efficient plants from both companies (technical economies), and eliminate duplicated administrative roles (managerial economies). These efficiencies lead to a reduction in the long-run average cost (LRAC) of production.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: price elasticity of demand: decrease, long-run average cost: increase\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the price elasticity of demand will decrease due to the reduction in competition. However, it incorrectly suggests that the long-run average cost will increase. An increase in long-run average costs would be due to diseconomies of scale, such as problems with coordination or communication in a much larger organisation. While this is a potential risk, a primary motivation for a takeover is to achieve cost synergies and economies of scale. Therefore, the firm would *expect* its long-run average costs to decrease, not increase.\n\n#### C: price elasticity of demand: increase, long-run average cost: decrease\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the long-run average cost is expected to decrease as the firm reaps economies of scale. However, it incorrectly states that the price elasticity of demand will increase. An increase in PED implies that demand has become more sensitive to price changes. This would typically occur if consumers gained more choices or substitutes. The takeover of a main competitor does the opposite: it reduces the number of substitutes, thereby making demand less price-elastic, not more.\n\n#### D: price elasticity of demand: increase, long-run average cost: increase\n\nThis option is incorrect on both points. As explained above, the elimination of a major competitor reduces the number of substitutes, causing the price elasticity of demand to decrease (become more inelastic), not increase. Furthermore, the primary expectation from a horizontal merger is the realisation of economies of scale, which would lead to a decrease in long-run average costs, not an increase due to diseconomies of scale."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_69.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "9 whatis an example of an external cost?\na distribution costs\nb_ energy costs\nc labour costs\nd_ road congestion costs", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn external cost, also known as a negative externality, is a cost imposed on a third party who is not directly involved in the production or consumption of a good or service. The cost is not reflected in the market price. Road congestion is a classic example of an external cost. When an individual or firm chooses to use a road, they consider their private costs (fuel, time). However, their presence on the road contributes to traffic, which slows down all other users. The resulting costs of lost time, increased fuel consumption, and pollution for these other users (the third parties) are not borne by the original road user. This divergence between the private cost to the user and the total social cost (which includes the costs to others) defines road congestion as an external cost.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. distribution costs**\nDistribution costs are the expenses a firm incurs to transport goods to the consumer. These include costs for fuel, vehicle maintenance, and wages for drivers. Since these costs are paid directly by the firm as part of its operations, they are classified as **private costs**, not external costs. Private costs are internal to the economic transaction and are reflected in the final price of the product.\n\n**B. energy costs**\nEnergy costs, such as payments for electricity or gas used in a factory, are direct inputs into the production process. The firm is responsible for paying these bills. Therefore, energy costs are **private costs** borne by the producer. They are accounted for in the firm's budget and contribute to the market price of the final good, unlike external costs, which are imposed on parties outside the transaction.\n\n**C. labour costs**\nLabour costs include wages, salaries, and other benefits paid to employees. These are a fundamental expense for any business and represent the cost of hiring the factors of production. As the firm directly pays these costs to its workers, they are considered **private costs**.

This can be calculated in two parts:\n    *   From output 0 to the socially optimal level (where D intersects MSC), the MSB exceeds the MSC. The cumulative net benefit gained over this range is represented by area **x**. This is the maximum possible social welfare.\n    *   From the socially optimal level to the market equilibrium output OQ, the MSC exceeds the MSB.

This cumulative net loss, known as a deadweight welfare loss, is represented by area **y**.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** To find the total net social benefit at output OQ, we take the maximum possible benefit (area **x**) and subtract the welfare loss from overproduction (area **y**).

Area **x** represents the net social benefit at the socially optimal level of output, where MSB equals MSC. The question asks for the net social benefit at the free market equilibrium output OQ, which is beyond the social optimum. Area **x** represents the *maximum* net social benefit, not the net benefit at quantity OQ.\n\n**C: x + y**\nThis is incorrect. Area **x** is a net social benefit, whereas area **y** represents a deadweight welfare loss (a net social cost) due to overproduction.

This separation creates a situation where the interests of the owners and the managers may diverge.\n\nThis divergence of interests is the core of the **principal-agent problem**. The principals (owners) typically want to maximise profits, as this increases the value of their shares and the dividends they receive. However, the agents (managers), who have more information about the business, may pursue their own objectives. These might include maximising sales revenue (as managerial pay is often linked to company size), expanding the firm ('empire building') for greater prestige, or enjoying corporate perks, even if these actions do not maximise profit for the shareholders. The principal-agent problem is, by definition, the conflict of interest and information asymmetry that arises from the separation of ownership and control.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. decreased moral hazard**\n\nThis is incorrect. Moral hazard occurs when an agent takes more risks because someone else (the principal) bears the cost of those risks. The divorce of ownership and control is likely to *increase*, not decrease, moral hazard. Managers might make excessively risky business decisions or fail to minimise costs because they know that if these actions result in financial losses, it is the shareholders who will primarily suffer, not the managers personally.\n\n**C. greater productive efficiency**\n\nThis is incorrect. Productive efficiency occurs when a firm produces at the lowest possible average cost. The principal-agent problem can lead to productive *inefficiency*. Managers may lack the incentive to rigorously control costs, especially if doing so requires difficult decisions or does not directly increase their personal remuneration. They might instead opt for 'satisficing' behaviour\u2014achieving a satisfactory level of profit rather than the maximum\u2014or incur unnecessary expenses that increase their own status or comfort, thus raising the firm's average costs.\n\n**D. increased profit maximisation**\n\nThis is incorrect. While profit maximisation is the assumed goal of the owners (shareholders), the divorce of ownership and control often leads to a deviation from this objective. As explained by the principal-agent problem, managers may prioritise other goals such as sales revenue maximisation, market share, or personal utility (e.g., status, power, job security). Pursuing these alternative objectives typically means the firm will not operate at the profit-maximising level of output (where marginal cost equals marginal revenue)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_72.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "12 one reason for market failure is the existence of public goods.\nwhich policy option is appropriate for addressing such a market failure?\na direct provision of the good by the government\nb __ provision of detailed information to consumers\nc _ subsidising firms that currently produce the good\nd_ the adoption of maximum price controls", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nPublic goods are a cause of market failure because they possess two key characteristics: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous.\n*   **Non-excludability** means that it is not possible to prevent individuals from consuming the good once it is provided, even if they do not pay for it. This creates the 'free-rider problem', where individuals have an incentive to use the good without contributing to its cost.\n*   **Non-rivalry** means that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce its availability to others.\n\nDue to the free-rider problem, private firms have no profit incentive to supply public goods. They cannot charge a price and exclude non-payers, so they would be unable to cover their costs. Consequently, the free market would fail to provide these goods at all, or would provide them in insufficient quantities, leading to a missing market. The most appropriate policy response is for the government to intervene and provide the good directly, funding it through compulsory taxation. This ensures that essential public goods, such as national defence, street lighting, and flood control systems, are supplied for the benefit of society.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. provision of detailed information to consumers**\nThis policy is designed to correct market failures arising from **asymmetric information**, where one party in a transaction (usually the seller) has more information than the other (the buyer). Providing information helps consumers make more rational and informed choices. However, this does not address the fundamental problem of public goods, which is the lack of a profit motive for private provision due to the free-rider problem, not a lack of information about the good's benefits.\n\n**C. subsidising firms that currently produce the good**\nSubsidies are a policy tool typically used to encourage the production and consumption of **merit goods**\u2014goods that have positive externalities but are not pure public goods (e.g., education, healthcare). For a pure public good, there are often no private firms producing it in the first place because it is impossible to make a profit. Therefore, there would be no firms to subsidise. Even if a firm were subsidised, the issue of non-excludability and the free-rider problem would remain, making it an inefficient and indirect solution compared to direct provision.\n\n**D. the adoption of maximum price controls**\nMaximum price controls, or price ceilings, are set by the government below the market equilibrium price. This policy is typically implemented to make essential goods more affordable or to control the market power of a monopoly. This is entirely inappropriate for public goods. The problem with public goods is not that their price is too high, but that a price cannot be effectively charged at all, leading to a complete lack of provision by the private sector.

These are often referred to as 'command-and-control' policies because they mandate or forbid specific actions, rather than relying on market-based incentives. An order to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from a future date is a direct command that restricts the types of products that can be sold in the market.

In such a system, the government sets a total cap on the amount of pollution allowed and issues a limited number of tradable permits to firms. This creates a market for the 'right to pollute'. The policy described in the scenario is a direct prohibition on the sale of certain goods, not a market-based mechanism. It does not create a system of tradable permits for vehicle emissions but instead mandates a complete halt to the sale of new conventional vehicles.\n\n**C. nationalisation**\n\nNationalisation is the process by which a government takes ownership and control of a private firm or an entire industry, transferring it from the private sector to the public sector.

In the diagram, the MCL and MRP curves intersect at a quantity of labour Q\u2082. To hire this quantity of labour (Q\u2082), the monopsonist only needs to pay the wage rate shown on the labour supply curve (S = ACL). At quantity Q\u2082, the corresponding wage on the supply curve is W\u2081. Therefore, W\u2081 is the wage the monopsonist wishes to pay.\n\n2.  **The Wage Received by Labour:** The government imposes a minimum wage at W\u2082. This wage is a price floor, meaning no worker can be paid less than W\u2082. With this minimum wage in place, the firm will hire labour up to the point where its demand for labour (MRP) equals the new effective marginal cost of labour, which is the minimum wage itself. The MRP curve intersects the minimum wage line at quantity Q\u2081. At this level of employment, the wage that is paid and received by labour is the legally mandated minimum wage, W\u2082.\n\n3.  **The Difference:** The question asks for the difference between the wage the monopsonist wishes to pay (W\u2081) and the wage received by labour under the new regulation (W\u2082).

For a profit-maximising firm, it is rational to continue hiring additional workers as long as the revenue they generate (MRP) is greater than or equal to the cost of hiring them (the wage rate, or more generally, the Marginal Factor Cost). Therefore, the MRP curve, which shows the quantity of labour demanded at each wage rate, is the firm's demand curve for labour.\n\nThe MRP is calculated by multiplying two components:\n1.  **Marginal Physical Product (MPP):** This is the additional output (or physical product) produced when one more unit of labour is employed.\n2.  **Marginal Revenue (MR):** This is the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of output.\n\nThus, the formula is: **MRP = MPP \u00d7 MR**.

For a firm in imperfect competition, it is crucial to use marginal revenue (MR) rather than price, because to sell the additional output produced by a new worker, the firm must lower its price, causing MR to be less than the price (Average Revenue).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. by multiplying the average physical product by the average revenue**\nThis calculation yields the Average Revenue Product (ARP), where ARP = APP \u00d7 AR. The ARP measures the average revenue generated per worker, not the additional revenue from hiring one more worker. A firm's hiring decisions are made at the margin\u2014comparing the cost of the next worker with the revenue that specific worker generates. The demand for labour is based on these marginal considerations, not on averages.\n\n**B. by multiplying the average physical product by the marginal revenue**\nThis option incorrectly uses the average physical product (APP) instead of the marginal physical product (MPP). When deciding whether to hire an additional worker, a firm is concerned with the specific contribution of that new worker (their MPP), not the average productivity of all workers employed (the APP). The law of diminishing marginal returns states that MPP will eventually decline, and it is this marginal change that drives the hiring decision.\n\n**C. by multiplying the marginal physical product by the marginal cost**\nThis calculation is conceptually flawed for deriving a demand curve. Multiplying the marginal physical product (MPP, which is \u2206Output/\u2206Labour) by the marginal cost of production (MC, which is \u2206Cost/\u2206Output) results in the marginal cost of the factor (\u2206Cost/\u2206Labour), which is the wage rate in a competitive labour market. This represents the cost of hiring an additional worker, which corresponds to the supply curve of labour faced by the firm, not its demand curve for labour. The demand for labour is derived from the revenue it generates, not the cost of production."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_76.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "16 the diagram shows the lorenz curves for norway (n) and india (1).\noe ee\ncumulative\npercentage line of\nof income perfect equality\n0 '\n0 100\ncumulative percentage\nof households\nwhat can be concluded from a comparison of the lorenz curves?\na india is more likely to have lower indirect taxes and a public sector education system than\nnorway.\nb india is more likely to have a progressive income tax system and means tested benefits than\nnorway.\nc_ norway is more likely to have a progressive tax system and public sector pensions than\nindia.\nd norway is likely to have a higher percentage of tax generated from indirect taxes and\nprivately funded pensions than india.", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe Lorenz curve for Norway (N) is closer to the line of perfect equality than the Lorenz curve for India (I). This indicates that Norway has a more equal distribution of income than India. A more equal distribution of income is typically the result of government policies aimed at redistribution. A progressive tax system, where higher-income earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes, is a key tool for reducing income inequality. Similarly, public sector pensions act as a transfer payment, providing income to the elderly and reducing poverty and inequality within this demographic. These policies effectively take a larger proportion of income from the wealthy and/or provide support to lower-income groups, shifting the post-tax and transfer Lorenz curve closer to the line of perfect equality. Therefore, it is a reasonable conclusion that Norway's greater income equality is supported by policies such as a progressive tax system and public sector pensions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A.** This statement is unlikely to be correct. While a public sector education system generally promotes equality, lower indirect taxes would have an ambiguous or potentially equality-promoting effect (as indirect taxes are often regressive). However, the central observation is that India has greater inequality than Norway. The policies mentioned in this option, particularly lower indirect taxes, do not align with the higher level of income inequality observed for India in the diagram.\n\n**B.** This statement is inconsistent with the evidence presented in the Lorenz curve diagram. A more progressive income tax system and more generous means-tested benefits are policies that reduce income inequality. If India were more likely to have these policies than Norway, its Lorenz curve would be closer to the line of perfect equality, not further away. The diagram shows the opposite is true, indicating that Norway likely has more effective or extensive redistributive policies.\n\n**D.** This statement describes policies that would tend to increase, not decrease, income inequality. A higher reliance on indirect taxes (which are typically regressive, taking a larger percentage of income from the poor) and privately funded pensions (which benefit higher earners who can contribute more) would lead to a less equal distribution of income.

A government decision that successfully reduces negative externalities is an example of a *successful* government intervention. Negative externalities, such as pollution, are a form of market failure where the social cost of an activity exceeds the private cost. By implementing policies like taxes or regulations to reduce these externalities, the government aims to align the private cost with the social cost, thereby correcting the market failure and improving the allocation of resources. This action represents the intended and successful outcome of intervention, not a failure of it.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Governments may have to make decisions on the basis of out-of-date information.**\nThis is a significant cause of government failure. Economic data on variables like inflation, unemployment, and GDP is collected with a time lag. Policies formulated based on this historical data may be inappropriate by the time they are implemented, as the economic situation may have already changed. This information gap can lead to pro-cyclical policies that exacerbate economic fluctuations rather than stabilising them, resulting in an inefficient outcome.\n\n**C. The extent of the market failure may be difficult to judge.**\nThis is another key reason for government failure, stemming from imperfect information. To effectively correct a market failure, such as a negative externality, the government needs to accurately quantify its magnitude (e.g., the monetary value of the external cost). This is often extremely difficult. If the government overestimates or underestimates the problem, the resulting intervention (e.g., a Pigouvian tax or subsidy) will be set at the wrong level, leading to a new misallocation of resources and a deadweight loss, which constitutes government failure.\n\n**D. When circumstances change, a government may be unable to respond quickly.**\nThis describes government failure caused by administrative and time lags. The policy-making process, from problem recognition to implementation, can be slow and bureaucratic. Economic conditions can change rapidly, but government responses are often delayed. A policy that would have been effective when it was first proposed may be ineffective or even harmful by the time it is finally enacted.

This approach achieves two critical objectives simultaneously. Firstly, it supports growth in the overall fish supply industry by developing a new, controlled source of production (fish farms). This expansion creates new investment and employment opportunities. Secondly, and crucially for sustainability, it reduces the pressure on wild fish stocks in the ocean. By diverting labour and capital away from sea fishing, it helps to mitigate overfishing, allowing natural fish populations to recover and stabilise. This ensures the long-term viability of both the wild-catch sector and the new aquaculture sector, leading to sustainable growth for the industry as a whole.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: giving more modern fishing boats with larger nets to workers who fish for a living**\n\nThis policy would lead to unsustainable outcomes. While providing more modern equipment and larger nets would likely increase the fish catch in the short term, boosting industry output, it would do so by accelerating the depletion of wild fish stocks. This practice of increasing fishing capacity without corresponding conservation measures directly contributes to overfishing, where fish are caught at a rate faster than they can reproduce. This undermines the long-term viability of the industry, leading to a potential collapse of fish populations and, consequently, the fishing industry itself.\n\n**B: paying bonus payments for larger fish catches to workers who fish for a living**\n\nThis policy creates a direct financial incentive for overfishing. By rewarding larger catches, the government encourages fishermen to maximise their harvest without regard for the long-term health of the fish stocks. This would intensify the exploitation of a common-pool resource, leading to a rapid decline in fish populations. While this might generate a temporary spike in growth, it is fundamentally unsustainable as it depletes the very resource upon which the industry depends.\n\n**C: setting up a fish cooperative so that workers who fish for a living receive a higher price for the fish that they catch**\n\nWhile a cooperative could improve the economic welfare of fishermen by increasing their market power and securing higher prices, this policy does not inherently address the issue of sustainability. In fact, by making fishing more profitable, it could inadvertently incentivise an increase in fishing effort to capitalise on the higher returns. Without explicit conservation measures like catch quotas or fishing restrictions, this policy could potentially worsen overfishing, thereby working against the goal of sustainable growth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_79.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "19 four citizens have each been unemployed for the past six months.\n\nwhich citizen would not be characterised as being structurally unemployed?\n\na_ worked as a coal miner but coal-fired power stations are now being closed and is not willing\nto retrain\n\nb_no longer works in a town centre coffee shop because fewer people are buying goods in the\ntown centre since a pandemic\n\nc cannot move with the firm that has relocated because of changing demand for its products\n\nd_ has many skills and is waiting to decide which job might be the most suitable", "Chapter": 25, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThis citizen is experiencing **frictional unemployment**.

This implies that jobs matching their skills are available, but they are taking time to search and find the best fit. This job search period is characteristic of frictional, not structural, unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** This citizen is a clear example of being **structurally unemployed**. Structural unemployment arises from a fundamental, long-term shift in the structure of an economy, leading to a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. The decline of the coal industry, evidenced by the closure of coal-fired power stations, has made the coal miner's specific skills obsolete.

This is represented by the point on the 45\u00b0 line corresponding to income OQ, which is point V. The required level of expenditure is therefore QV.\n3.  **Identify Actual Expenditure at Full Employment Income:** At the income level OQ, the actual aggregate expenditure in the economy is shown by the C+I+G line. This corresponds to point U, meaning the actual expenditure is QU.\n4.  **Calculate the Gap:** The deflationary gap is the difference between the required expenditure (QV) and the actual expenditure (QU) at the full employment income level. This shortfall is the vertical distance UV. This is the amount by which aggregate expenditure would need to rise to shift the C+I+G curve upwards and move the equilibrium from OP to OQ.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. PQ**\n\nThe horizontal distance PQ represents the difference between the full employment level of income (OQ) and the current equilibrium level of income (OP). This is known as the **output gap** or the **recessionary income gap**. It measures the shortfall in national income or output, which is a consequence of the deflationary gap, but it is not the deflationary gap itself. The deflationary gap is a measure of the shortfall in expenditure.\n\n**B. RV**\n\nThe vertical distance RV is the difference between the level of expenditure needed for full employment equilibrium (QV) and the level of consumption spending at the full employment income level (QR). This distance (RV) is composed of Investment (RT), Government Spending (TU), and the deflationary gap (UV). Therefore, RV = I + G + Deflationary Gap. It does not represent the deflationary gap alone.\n\n**C. TV**\n\nThe vertical distance TV represents the difference between the expenditure required for full employment (QV) and the level of expenditure from consumption and investment (C+I) at the full employment income level (QT). This distance is the sum of government spending (G), which is the segment TU, and the deflationary gap, which is the segment UV.

It is a natural part of a dynamic economy where people are constantly moving between jobs. The core cause of this unemployment is imperfect information in the labor market, which prolongs the job search and matching process.\n\nImproving information about job vacancies directly addresses this market failure. By funding and improving public employment agencies, creating comprehensive online job databases, and supporting career advisory services, a government can make the labor market more transparent and efficient. This enables unemployed workers to find suitable job openings more quickly and helps employers identify qualified applicants with greater ease, thereby reducing the duration of joblessness and lowering the rate of frictional unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. cut welfare spending on benefits**\n\nWhile cutting unemployment benefits can reduce frictional unemployment, it is not considered the most effective or direct policy. This policy works by increasing the opportunity cost of being unemployed, creating a stronger financial incentive for individuals to accept a job offer sooner. However, it does not address the fundamental issue of imperfect information. It may pressure individuals into accepting jobs that are poor matches for their skills, potentially leading to lower productivity and higher labor turnover in the long run.\n\n**C. reduce tax rates**\n\nReducing income tax rates is a supply-side policy aimed at increasing the incentive to work by raising disposable income. While this might encourage some individuals to search for work more actively or enter the labor force, it is a general policy that does not specifically target the information-based frictions in the labor market. Its effect on the duration of the job search process, which is the key determinant of frictional unemployment, is indirect and likely less significant than policies that directly improve job market information.\n\n**D. raise interest rates**\n\nRaising interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy used primarily to control inflation by reducing aggregate demand. A decrease in aggregate demand leads to lower economic output and a reduced demand for labor from firms. This would likely cause an increase in cyclical (demand-deficient) unemployment, not a reduction in frictional unemployment.

The investment is an injection into the circular flow of income, which increases the income of households. These households then spend a portion of this new income, which becomes income for other households, and so on. The total increase in national income depends on the size of the multiplier.\n\nIn a closed economy with no government, the multiplier (k) is calculated as:\nk = 1 / (1 - MPC)\nwhere MPC is the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of an additional unit of income that is spent on consumption. A high MPC means that a large fraction of any new income is re-spent in the economy. This leads to larger subsequent rounds of spending, creating a larger multiplier effect. Consequently, a higher MPC results in a larger overall increase in equilibrium national income for any given initial increase in investment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**A. when households have a high level of autonomous consumption**\nAutonomous consumption is the level of spending that is independent of income. While a high level of autonomous consumption contributes to a higher initial level of aggregate demand, it does not influence the size of the multiplier. The multiplier effect is determined by the proportion of *additional* income that is re-spent, which is measured by the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), not the fixed level of autonomous spending.\n\n**B. when households have a high level of compulsory saving**\nSaving, whether voluntary or compulsory, is a withdrawal (or leakage) from the circular flow of income. A high level of compulsory saving means that a significant portion of household income is removed from the spending stream and is not available for consumption. This would reduce the amount of re-spending in each round of the multiplier process, leading to a smaller multiplier and a smaller increase in national income.\n\n**D. when households have a high marginal propensity to save**\nThe marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the proportion of an additional unit of income that is saved. Saving represents a leakage from the circular flow of income. The multiplier can also be expressed as k = 1 / MPS. This formula shows an inverse relationship between the MPS and the multiplier. A high MPS means that a large fraction of any additional income is saved rather than consumed.

Both policies are designed to stimulate aggregate demand (AD) and thereby increase national output.\n\n*   **Expansionary Fiscal Policy (Increase Budget Deficit):** A government increases its budget deficit by either increasing its spending (G) or decreasing taxes (T). An increase in government spending is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, boosting AD. A decrease in taxes increases the disposable income of households and post-tax profits of firms, leading to higher consumption (C) and investment (I), which also increases AD.\n\n*   **Expansionary Monetary Policy (Decrease Interest Rates):** A central bank decreases interest rates to make borrowing cheaper. This incentivises both consumers and firms to take out loans. Lower borrowing costs encourage household spending on durable goods (increasing C) and stimulate firms to undertake new investment projects (increasing I).\n\nThe combined effect of both policies strongly shifts the AD curve to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium level of real output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: Decrease budget deficit and decrease interest rates\n\nThis option combines a contractionary fiscal policy with an expansionary monetary policy. A decrease in the budget deficit (fiscal consolidation) involves reducing government spending or increasing taxes, which reduces aggregate demand. A decrease in interest rates is an expansionary monetary policy that encourages consumption and investment, increasing aggregate demand. Because the two policies have opposing effects on aggregate demand, the net impact on output is ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitude of each policy change. It is not the most likely combination to cause a definite increase in output.\n\n#### B: Decrease budget deficit and increase interest rates\n\nThis option combines a contractionary fiscal policy with a contractionary monetary policy. Decreasing the budget deficit reduces aggregate demand by lowering government spending or raising taxes. Increasing interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, discouraging consumption and investment, which also reduces aggregate demand. Since both policies work in the same direction to reduce aggregate demand, this combination is most likely to decrease, not increase, national output. It is typically used to combat high inflation.\n\n#### D: Increase budget deficit and increase interest rates\n\nThis option combines an expansionary fiscal policy with a contractionary monetary policy. An increasing budget deficit stimulates aggregate demand. However, an increase in interest rates discourages private consumption and investment, thereby dampening aggregate demand. This policy mix has conflicting effects on output.

A rise in the price of oil increases the costs of production for a vast number of firms. To protect their profit margins, these firms pass on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. This leads to cost-push inflation, which is a general increase in the price level caused by a decrease in aggregate supply. In the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model, this is represented by a leftward shift of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve, resulting in a higher equilibrium price level. Therefore, inflation is likely to **increase**.\n\n2.  **Trade Balance:** The trade balance is the difference between the value of a country's exports and its imports (X-M). As the country is a net importer of oil, it buys more oil from other countries than it sells. When the price of oil rises, the country must spend more foreign currency to import the same quantity of oil (assuming demand for oil is relatively price-inelastic in the short term). This increase in the import bill, assuming the value of exports remains constant, will cause the total value of imports to exceed the value of exports by a larger margin, or it will reduce a trade surplus. Consequently, the trade balance **worsens**, leading to a larger trade deficit.\n\n3.  **Unemployment:** The increase in oil prices and subsequent rise in production costs can lead to an economic slowdown. As firms face higher costs, their profitability declines. In response, they may reduce their scale of production and cut back on investment. A decrease in national output (real GDP) reduces the demand for labour, as fewer workers are needed to produce a smaller quantity of goods and services. This leads to an **increase** in cyclical unemployment. This phenomenon, where inflation and unemployment both rise simultaneously, is known as stagflation.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A is incorrect** because a rise in the price of a key commodity like oil causes cost-push inflation, meaning inflation would **increase**, not decrease.

An imposition of maximum hours in a working week is a form of labour market regulation that directly restricts the quantity of labour, a key factor of production. By limiting the number of hours an individual can work, this policy can reduce the total potential output of the workforce and limit firms' ability to expand production. This acts in direct opposition to the goals of supply-side policies, which often seek to increase labour market flexibility and the supply of labour. Therefore, such a regulation would reduce or counteract the effectiveness of any other supply-side stimulus aimed at boosting economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. an increase in public sector spending**\n\nThis is primarily a demand-side policy, specifically expansionary fiscal policy, which aims to increase aggregate demand (AD). While it is not a supply-side stimulus, it does not necessarily reduce the effectiveness of one. In fact, if the increased spending is directed towards infrastructure, education, or research and development, it could complement supply-side policies by enhancing the economy's long-run productive potential. Although a very large increase in spending financed by borrowing could potentially 'crowd out' private investment by raising interest rates, this is an indirect and not a guaranteed effect. The primary impact is on AD, not a direct reduction in the effectiveness of a supply-side policy.\n\n**C. the provision of new training schemes**\n\nThe provision of new training schemes is a classic example of a supply-side policy. By improving the skills, knowledge, and productivity of the workforce (i.e., enhancing human capital), training schemes directly contribute to increasing the economy's productive potential. This would shift the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. Consequently, this policy is a form of supply-side stimulus itself and would enhance, not reduce, the effectiveness of an overall supply-side strategy.\n\n**D. the relaxation of import controls on raw materials**\n\nThis is another example of a supply-side policy. Relaxing import controls, such as tariffs or quotas, on raw materials reduces the cost of production for domestic firms. Lower input costs incentivise firms to increase their output at any given price level, shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the right. This contributes to expanding the productive capacity of the economy.

The MNC invests in building or acquiring physical assets like factories and purchasing capital goods like machinery and equipment. This constitutes an injection of investment into the host country's economy, leading to an increase in its total capital stock and aggregate demand.\n\n3.  **Short-run Balance of Payments Current Account Does Not Improve:** The initial investment by the MNC is a credit on the financial account (or capital account) of the balance of payments, not the current account. In the short run, the current account is likely to worsen. This is because the MNC will need to import specialised machinery, technology, and other capital goods to set up its operations, which increases the host country's import expenditure. While the MNC may eventually export its finished goods, which would improve the current account, this is a longer-term effect. The immediate, short-run impact is often a deterioration of the current account balance due to the surge in capital goods imports.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because employment and investment are both likely to increase. Furthermore, the short-run effect on the current account is more likely to be a deterioration rather than an improvement, due to the import of capital goods required to establish the new manufacturing capacity.\n\n**B:** This option correctly identifies that investment will increase and the current account is unlikely to improve in the short run. However, it incorrectly states that employment will not increase. Setting up and running a manufacturing plant inherently requires hiring a local workforce, which leads to job creation.\n\n**C:** This option correctly states that employment will increase. However, it is incorrect on the other two points. Shifting manufacturing capacity is a form of investment, so investment will increase. The current account is unlikely to improve in the short run because the new facility will require imported capital goods, which will increase the country's import bill and worsen the current account balance."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_87.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "27 to indicate the changing income distribution, the kuznets curve plots gross domestic product per\ncapita against an economic variable x.\nwhat is variable x?\na_ the exchange rate\nb | the level of income inequality\nc the price level\nd the rate of interest", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe Kuznets curve is a graphical representation of the hypothesis that as an economy develops, market forces first increase and then decrease economic inequality. It specifically plots a measure of economic development, typically gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, against a measure of income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient. The resulting curve is typically an inverted 'U' shape, illustrating that income inequality tends to rise during the initial stages of industrialisation and urbanisation, and then fall as the economy matures and becomes more developed. Therefore, the economic variable plotted against GDP per capita is the level of income inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe exchange rate is the value of one nation's currency in terms of another nation's currency. While economic development and GDP per capita can influence a country's exchange rate through factors like trade balances and capital flows, the Kuznets curve is not designed to illustrate this relationship. The primary focus of the Kuznets curve is on the internal distribution of income within a country as it develops, not on the external value of its currency.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe price level refers to the average of current prices of goods and services produced in an economy. The relationship between the aggregate price level and the level of national output (Real GDP) is typically analysed using the Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model. The Kuznets curve, however, addresses a different economic question. It is not concerned with the general level of prices but with how the income generated from producing goods and services is distributed amongst the population.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThe rate of interest is the cost of borrowing or the reward for saving money. It plays a critical role in influencing investment and saving decisions within an economy and is a key variable in monetary policy and models of the macroeconomy, such as the IS-LM model. The Kuznets curve, in contrast, focuses on the distributional consequences of long-run economic growth.

The more developed regions have the lowest growth rate of urbanisation between 2010 and 2050.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The growth rate of urbanisation refers to the change in the percentage of the population residing in urban areas over a period. To verify this, we calculate the change in the percentage of the urbanised population for each region type from 2010 to 2050.\n\n*   **More developed regions:** The percentage urbanised increases from 75% in 2010 to 86% in 2050, an increase of **11 percentage points**.\n*   **Less developed regions:** The percentage urbanised increases from 45% in 2010 to 66% in 2050, an increase of **21 percentage points**.\n*   **Least developed regions:** The percentage urbanised increases from 29% in 2010 to 55% in 2050, an increase of **26 percentage points**.\n\nComparing these increases, the more developed regions show the smallest change (11 percentage points), indicating the lowest growth rate of urbanisation among the three categories.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. The least developed regions have the largest urban populations, actual or predicted, in both years.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An examination of the data on urban populations in millions (m) reveals the following:\n*   **In 2010:** The urban population of least developed regions was 249m, which was smaller than that of more developed regions (930m) and significantly smaller than that of less developed regions (2556m).\n*   **In 2050 (predicted):** The urban population of least developed regions is estimated to be 914m, which is less than that of more developed regions (1100m) and far less than that of less developed regions (5186m).\nIn both years, the less developed regions, not the least developed regions, have the largest urban populations.\n\n**C. The type of region with the greatest total population in 2010 is predicted to have the greatest rate of population growth by 2050.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. First, we identify the region with the greatest total population in 2010, which is the \"less developed\" regions with 5671m people. Next, we calculate the percentage growth in total population for each region from 2010 to 2050:\n*   **More developed:** [(1275 - 1237) / 1237] * 100 \u2248 3.1%\n*   **Less developed:** [(7875 - 5671) / 5671] * 100 \u2248 38.9%\n*   **Least developed:** [(1673 - 855) / 855] * 100 \u2248 95.7%\nThe region with the greatest rate of population growth is the \"least developed\" regions (95.7%), not the \"less developed\" regions. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the data.\n\n**D. The type of region with the greatest urban population in 2010 is predicted to have the highest level of urbanisation by 2050.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The region with the greatest urban population in 2010 was the \"less developed\" regions, with 2556m people living in urban areas. The \"level of urbanisation\" is the percentage of the population that is urbanised. According to the table's predictions for 2050:\n*   **More developed:** 86% urbanised\n*   **Less developed:** 66% urbanised\n*   **Least developed:** 55% urbanised\nThe highest predicted level of urbanisation by 2050 is in the \"more developed\" regions (86%).

It is derived from the Lorenz curve diagram. The calculation is based on the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of perfect equality.\n\nIn the given diagram:\n*   **Area X** represents the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve. This area quantifies the extent of deviation from a perfectly equal distribution.\n*   The total area under the line of perfect equality is represented by the sum of **Area X** and **Area Y**.\n\nTherefore, the Gini coefficient is calculated by dividing the area of inequality (Area X) by the total area under the line of perfect equality (Area X + Area Y). The formula is:\n\nGini Coefficient = Area X / (Area X + Area Y)\n\nA larger Area X relative to Area Y indicates greater income inequality and results in a Gini coefficient closer to 1.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: (X plus Y) divided by X**\n\nThis calculation, (X + Y) / X, represents the reciprocal of the Gini coefficient. Since the Gini coefficient is a value between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (perfect inequality), its reciprocal would be a value of 1 or greater. This does not conform to the standard definition and range of the Gini coefficient.\n\n**C: (X plus Y) divided by Y**\n\nThis expression represents the ratio of the total area under the line of perfect equality (X + Y) to the area under the Lorenz curve (Y). While it uses the components of the diagram, this ratio is not the standard formula for the Gini coefficient or any other commonly used measure of income distribution. The Gini coefficient focuses on the area of inequality (X) as a proportion of the total area.\n\n**D: Y divided by (X plus Y)**\n\nThis calculation, Y / (X + Y), represents the ratio of the area under the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of perfect equality. This value is sometimes referred to as an \"index of equality\" and is complementary to the Gini coefficient (i.e., it equals 1 minus the Gini coefficient).

In the context of healthcare, including dentistry, the provider (the dentist) has specialised expertise that the consumer (the patient) lacks. The dentist can accurately diagnose the patient's condition and knows the full range of appropriate treatments, whereas the patient must rely on the dentist's professional judgement. This information imbalance creates a principal-agent problem, where the agent (the dentist) may have incentives\u2014such as increased revenue\u2014that are not perfectly aligned with the best interests of the principal (the patient). This can lead to supplier-induced demand, where the dentist recommends and performs treatments that are more extensive or frequent than medically necessary, because the patient is not equipped with the information to question the recommendation. This directly explains why excessive dental treatment may occur.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. the existence of dynamic efficiency**\n**Explanation:**\nDynamic efficiency refers to the rate of product and process innovation in a market over time. It is concerned with how effectively an economy introduces new technologies and improves production methods, leading to better quality goods and lower costs in the long run. This concept is not relevant to explaining why a dentist might provide excessive treatment in the short term. The issue described is a market failure related to information, not a measure of long-term technological progress in the dental industry.\n\n**C. the existence of positive externalities**\n**Explanation:**\nA positive externality is a benefit experienced by a third party who is not involved in the economic transaction. For example, good dental care can lead to better overall health, potentially reducing the burden on public health services. However, the existence of positive externalities typically leads to the *under-consumption* of a good or service in a free market, because the market price does not reflect the full social benefit. The scenario describes *over*-treatment (a form of over-consumption), which is the opposite of the market outcome predicted by the presence of positive externalities.\n\n**D. the existence of social benefits**\n**Explanation:**\nSocial benefits are the total benefits to society from the consumption of a good, equal to the sum of private benefits and external benefits. While dental treatment certainly has social benefits, this fact does not explain why *excessive* treatment would take place. The concept of social benefits is used to determine the socially optimal level of consumption. If social benefits exceed private benefits (due to positive externalities), it implies that the market would under-provide the service, not over-provide it. The problem of unnecessary procedures stems from a specific market failure (asymmetric information), not from the overall value of the service to society."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_92.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "2 the diagram shows an individual\u2019s indifference curve, i,, for apples and pears.\napples\n19 4------y\n12 .\n\u2014_ i;\n0 i i\n0 2 4\npears\nwhat can be concluded from the movement from point x to point y on this curve?\na the individual can afford more apples than pears.\nb_ the individual has not changed their total utility.\nc_ the individual prefers apples to pears.\nd_ the individual has gained more utility by moving from point x to point y.", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAn indifference curve is a graphical representation of various combinations of two goods that provide a consumer with the same level of satisfaction or utility. By definition, every point on a single indifference curve represents a bundle of goods that the consumer finds equally desirable. Since both point X (a bundle of 4 pears and 12 apples) and point Y (a bundle of 2 pears and 19 apples) are located on the same indifference curve, I\u2081, the individual is indifferent between these two combinations. Therefore, moving from point X to point Y along the curve results in no change in the individual's total utility.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The individual can afford more apples than pears.**\nThis conclusion is incorrect because an indifference curve illustrates a consumer's preferences, not their purchasing power or what they can afford. Affordability is shown by a budget constraint line, which is determined by the consumer's income and the prices of the goods. The diagram does not provide any information about income or prices, so no conclusions can be drawn about what the individual can afford.\n\n**C. The individual prefers apples to pears.**\nThis statement is an oversimplification. An indifference curve shows the trade-offs a consumer is willing to make, not a general preference for one good over another. The movement from point X to point Y shows that the individual is willing to give up 2 pears to gain 7 apples while remaining equally satisfied. This specific trade-off is known as the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), which changes along the curve. It does not imply that apples are always preferred to pears, only that at point X, the utility gained from 7 more apples exactly compensates for the utility lost from 2 fewer pears. The individual is equally happy with the bundle at X and the bundle at Y.\n\n**D. The individual has gained more utility by moving from point X to point Y.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it contradicts the definition of an indifference curve. An increase in utility is represented by a movement to a higher indifference curve (one that is further from the origin).

While firms in an oligopoly possess the market power that could allow them to price discriminate, price leadership itself is not a required condition. A pure monopoly, for instance, can successfully practise price discrimination without any concept of a 'price leader' or 'followers' as it is the sole firm in the market. Therefore, price leadership is a specific model of oligopolistic behaviour, not a universal prerequisite for price discrimination.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) ability to separate markets**\nThis is a necessary condition for successful price discrimination. The firm must be able to divide its customers into distinct groups and prevent the product from being resold between these groups (a practice known as arbitrage). For example, airlines separate leisure travellers from business travellers by offering cheaper fares for tickets booked far in advance with a Saturday night stay. Without the ability to maintain this separation, customers in the lower-priced segment could buy the product and resell it to those in the higher-priced segment, undermining the entire pricing strategy.\n\n**B) different price elasticities of demand in each market**\nThis is a fundamental requirement for price discrimination to be profitable. Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. A firm maximises its profit by charging a higher price to the market segment with a more inelastic demand (consumers are less price-sensitive) and a lower price to the segment with a more elastic demand (consumers are more price-sensitive). If the PED were the same for all consumer groups, there would be no financial incentive for the firm to charge different prices.\n\n**C) monopoly power**\nThis is a necessary condition. Monopoly power refers to a firm's ability to be a 'price maker' rather than a 'price taker'. A firm in a perfectly competitive market has no market power and must accept the prevailing market price; it cannot charge different prices to different consumers. To practise price discrimination, a firm must have sufficient control over the supply of the product to be able to set and vary its prices. This power is characteristic of monopolies, oligopolies, and monopolistically competitive firms, but not perfectly competitive ones."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_94.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "4 the diagram shows the cost curves of a firm.\nwhat is the level of output below which the firm will shut down in the long run?\n\nmc\n\ncost or atc\n\nprice | \\\n\n$ 1\navc\n\nje) a b c od\nquantity", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nIn the long run, a firm will continue to operate only if it can cover all its costs, which are represented by the Average Total Cost (ATC). If the market price falls below the minimum point of the ATC curve, the firm will be making an economic loss (Total Revenue < Total Cost). Persistently earning economic losses is not sustainable, and the firm will exit the market or shut down.\n\nThe minimum point of the ATC curve represents the break-even point, where the firm earns normal profit (zero economic profit). This occurs where the Marginal Cost (MC) curve intersects the ATC curve. In the diagram, this intersection occurs at the quantity of output C. Therefore, C is the level of output corresponding to the minimum long-run average cost. If the price falls below the level associated with this point, the firm will shut down in the long run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nOutput level A corresponds to the minimum point on the Marginal Cost (MC) curve. This point is significant as it indicates the point of diminishing marginal returns, where the efficiency of adding more variable inputs begins to decline. However, this point is not directly related to the firm's decision to shut down, which is based on a comparison between the market price and the firm's average costs (either ATC for the long run or AVC for the short run).\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nOutput level B corresponds to the point where the Marginal Cost (MC) curve intersects the Average Variable Cost (AVC) curve. This is the minimum point of the AVC curve and represents the **short-run shutdown point**. A firm will cease production in the short run if the price falls below the minimum AVC because it cannot cover its per-unit variable costs. The question, however, specifically asks about the **long-run** shutdown decision, which requires covering all costs (ATC), not just variable costs. In the long run, fixed costs are also avoidable, so the firm must cover its total costs to remain in business.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nOutput level D is a point on the MC curve that is above both the ATC and AVC curves. If a firm is producing at output D, it implies that the market price is greater than the Average Total Cost (P > ATC) at that level of output.

This strategic move is expected to increase the firm's market power and lead to cost savings through economies of scale.\n\n*   **Effect on Average Revenue:** By taking over its main competitor, steel producer X significantly reduces the level of competition in the market. This increases its market share and strengthens its position as a price setter (i.e., it gains market power). With fewer rivals, the firm can increase the price of its product without losing a substantial portion of its customers to competitors. Since average revenue is equivalent to the price per unit (AR = P), an increase in price leads to an increase in average revenue.\n\n*   **Effect on Long-Run Average Cost:** The merger of two large steel producers creates a much larger single entity. This increased scale of operation allows the firm to benefit from various economies of scale. For example, the combined firm can negotiate lower prices for raw materials through bulk purchasing (purchasing economies), use larger and more efficient production facilities (technical economies), and streamline administrative functions (managerial economies). These efficiencies lead to a reduction in the cost per unit of output, thereby decreasing the long-run average cost.\n\nTherefore, the firm would expect its average revenue to increase and its long-run average cost to decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A: average revenue decrease, long-run average cost decrease.** This is incorrect because a reduction in competition from a takeover typically gives a firm the power to increase prices, not decrease them. While the long-run average cost is likely to decrease due to economies of scale, the expected effect on average revenue is an increase.\n\n*   **B: average revenue decrease, long-run average cost increase.** This is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, average revenue is expected to increase due to greater market power, not decrease. Secondly, while diseconomies of scale (leading to an increase in long-run average cost) are a potential risk of growing too large, the primary expectation and strategic goal of a takeover is to achieve cost-saving economies of scale.\n\n*   **D: average revenue increase, long-run average cost increase.** This is incorrect because a key motivation for a takeover is to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings. While the firm would expect to leverage its increased market power to raise average revenue, it would not plan or expect to become less efficient.

It arises from asymmetric information after a contract is agreed upon, where one party's actions are unobserved by the other. Designing insurance contracts to include loss-sharing mechanisms, such as deductibles or co-payments (co-insurance), is a primary method for overcoming moral hazard.\n\nBy requiring the client (the insured party) to bear a portion of any financial loss, the contract ensures the client has \"skin in the game.\" This creates a direct financial incentive for the client to act more prudently and take preventative measures to reduce the likelihood or magnitude of a loss. For example, a car owner with a deductible on their theft insurance is more likely to lock their car and park in safe areas. This sharing of risk helps to align the interests of the client with those of the insurance company, both of whom now wish to avoid a loss.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. charging the same insurance premium to all people in the same age group**\n\nThis policy does not address moral hazard. Moral hazard concerns a change in behaviour *after* obtaining insurance. Charging a uniform premium to a group fails to incentivise individuals to be more careful once they are insured. Instead, this practice, known as community rating, is more relevant to the problem of **adverse selection**. Adverse selection occurs *before* a contract is signed, where individuals with higher-than-average risk are more likely to purchase insurance at a given price, potentially making the insurance pool unprofitable. Charging a single premium does nothing to mitigate the risky behaviour that may occur post-contract.\n\n**C. giving unconditional financial support to banks to protect jobs**\n\nThis action would create or significantly worsen moral hazard, not overcome it. If banks believe they will receive unconditional bailouts from the government (i.e., they are \"too big to fail\"), their managers have a powerful incentive to take on excessive risk. They can pursue high-risk, high-return strategies knowing that if the strategies succeed, the bank's shareholders and executives will benefit, but if they fail, the government and taxpayers will bear the losses. This protection from the consequences of failure encourages the very risky behaviour that moral hazard describes.\n\n**D. guaranteeing jobs for bank managers to provide a sense of security**\n\nThis policy would also exacerbate moral hazard. A key mechanism for ensuring prudent management is the risk of personal consequences for failure, such as job loss. If bank managers' jobs are guaranteed regardless of the bank's performance or the risks they take, it decouples their personal welfare from the financial health of their institution. This removes a critical incentive for them to act in the long-term, stable interests of the bank and its stakeholders, encouraging them to take excessive risks without fear of personal professional repercussions."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_98.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "8 which action would produce a positive externality of production?\na_ achild is vaccinated against measles.\nb  aconsumer donates products to a local food bank.\nc_ a firm rebuilds a local road when constructing its new factory.\nd a government pays a subsidy to firms producing cars.", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA positive externality of production occurs when the production of a good or service creates external benefits for third parties who are not directly involved in the production process.

As part of this process, it rebuilds a local road. The firm incurs the private cost of rebuilding the road, likely to facilitate its own logistics. However, other road users, such as local residents and other businesses, receive the benefit of an improved road without having to pay for its reconstruction.

When a child is vaccinated, they are the consumer of a healthcare service. They receive a private benefit (immunity from measles). The positive externality arises because their vaccination contributes to herd immunity, reducing the risk of infection for others in the community. Since the externality stems from the act of consuming a service, not producing it, this option is incorrect.\n\n#### B: A consumer donates products to a local food bank.\n\nThis describes a charitable act or a transfer, not an externality. An externality is an unintended spillover effect of a market transaction (production or consumption). In this case, the consumer's primary intention is to provide a benefit to the food bank and its recipients. This is a direct transfer of resources, not an unintended consequence of a separate production or consumption activity. Furthermore, the action is undertaken by a consumer, not a producer.\n\n#### D: A government pays a subsidy to firms producing cars.\n\nA subsidy is a form of government intervention, not an externality. Subsidies are often used as a policy tool to *correct* for market failures, such as encouraging the production of goods that are believed to have positive externalities (e.g., subsidising electric car manufacturing).

An unregulated monopolist, however, profit-maximises by producing at the quantity where Marginal Revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC). This output level is typically less than the output level required to minimise ATC. Therefore, the monopolist is not productively efficient as it operates with excess capacity and does not produce at the lowest possible cost per unit.\n\n*   **Allocative Efficiency:** Allocative efficiency occurs where price (P) equals marginal cost (MC), signifying that the value consumers place on the last unit produced equals the cost of the resources used to produce it. A monopolist sets its price based on its downward-sloping demand (Average Revenue) curve at the profit-maximising output (where MR=MC). Because the MR curve is always below the AR curve for a monopolist, the price charged will be greater than the marginal cost (P > MC). This leads to an under-allocation of resources to the production of the good and a deadweight welfare loss, meaning the firm is allocatively inefficient.\n\n*   **Dynamic Efficiency:** Dynamic efficiency refers to improvements in products and production techniques over time, driven by investment in research and development (R&D). Due to high barriers to entry, a monopolist can earn and sustain supernormal profits in the long run. These profits provide the financial means to fund significant R&D, which can lead to innovation. The incentive to innovate exists to lower costs, improve products, and further solidify its monopoly position.

A profit-maximising monopolist restricts output and charges a price that is significantly higher than its marginal cost (P > MC), which is the definition of allocative inefficiency.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly states that the firm is productively efficient. A monopolist faces no direct competition, so there is no pressure to minimise costs.

This allows for a direct comparison to determine if the total social benefits outweigh the total social costs. In this scenario, the primary benefit identified is an \"increase in national pride.\" National pride is an intangible, non-market external benefit. It is extremely difficult to quantify in monetary terms because there is no market price for such a feeling, and its value is subjective, varying greatly among individuals. While economists may use methods like contingent valuation (surveying what people would be willing to pay), these are complex, often unreliable, and highly contentious. Therefore, the difficulty in accurately assessing the monetary value of a key benefit like national pride makes the entire CBA process complex and its conclusions debatable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The materials needed to build the stadium will need to be imported.**\nThis is incorrect because the cost of imported materials is a private cost that can be easily quantified. The price paid for these materials would be recorded in the project's budget and can be directly included in the cost side of the CBA calculation. The origin of the materials does not inherently complicate the analysis; it is simply a quantifiable cost.\n\n**B. The external costs of clearing land for building will outweigh the private costs.**\nThis statement describes a potential outcome of the cost analysis, not a reason why the analysis itself is difficult to perform. A CBA is specifically designed to identify, value, and compare both private costs (e.g., land purchase) and external costs (e.g., loss of natural habitat).

A firm's demand for labour is determined by the Marginal Revenue Product of labour (MRP_L), which is the additional revenue generated by employing one more worker. The MRP_L is calculated as the Marginal Physical Product of labour (MPP_L) multiplied by the Marginal Revenue (MR) from selling the extra output. The MRP_L curve is the firm's demand curve for labour.\n\nAn increase in the marginal productivity of labour (which is the MPP_L) means that each worker can produce more output in a given time period. This could be due to factors such as improved technology, better training, or increased capital per worker. This rise in MPP_L, assuming the price of the final product (and thus MR) remains constant, will increase the MRP_L. As each worker now generates more revenue for the firm, the firm will be willing to hire more workers at any given wage rate. This is represented graphically as a rightward shift of the demand curve for labour.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: a decrease in the marginal productivity of labour**\nA decrease in the marginal productivity of labour (MPP_L) would mean that each additional worker contributes less to total output. This would lower the Marginal Revenue Product of labour (MRP_L = MPP_L \u00d7 MR). As a result, labour becomes less valuable to the firm at any given wage rate, leading to a decrease in the demand for labour. This would cause the demand curve for labour to shift to the left, not to the right.\n\n**B: a decrease in the wage rate**\nA change in the wage rate, which is the price of labour, causes a movement *along* the demand curve for labour, not a *shift* of the curve. A decrease in the wage rate makes labour cheaper for firms, leading to an increase in the *quantity* of labour demanded. This is represented by a downward movement along the existing demand curve. It does not change the underlying relationship between productivity and revenue that defines the position of the demand curve itself.\n\n**D: an increase in the wage rate**\nSimilar to a decrease in the wage rate, an increase in the wage rate causes a movement *along* the demand curve for labour. A higher wage rate increases the cost of employing workers, which would lead to a decrease in the *quantity* of labour demanded as firms substitute away from labour towards other, relatively cheaper factors of production. This is represented by an upward movement along the existing demand curve, not a shift of the entire curve.

While it is true that the marginal product of the second worker is also 7.0 units (13.0 \u2013 6.0), this is not the point at which the average product is 7.0 units.

By providing wider access to education and skills development, particularly for individuals from lower-income backgrounds, the government can enhance their human capital. This leads to increased productivity and employability, allowing these individuals to secure higher-skilled, better-paying jobs. Over the long run, this raises the earning potential of the lower end of the income scale, narrowing the gap between the highest and lowest earners and thus promoting a more equal distribution of income.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** A reduction in the top rate of taxation would lead to a *less* equal distribution of income. The top rate of tax is paid by the highest earners in an economy. Reducing this rate increases their disposable income significantly, while the incomes of middle and lower earners remain largely unchanged. This action widens the post-tax income gap between the rich and the poor, resulting in greater income inequality.\n\n**C:** An increase in unemployment directly contributes to a *less* equal distribution of income. When individuals become unemployed, they lose their wage income, causing a significant fall in their standard of living. This increases the number of people at the very bottom of the income distribution, widening the gap between those with jobs (especially high-paying jobs) and those without. Therefore, rising unemployment exacerbates income inequality.\n\n**D:** The privatisation of the education sector would likely lead to a *less* equal distribution of income in the long run. In a privatised system, access to high-quality education often depends on the ability to pay fees. This would create a barrier for students from low-income families, limiting their opportunities for skills development and upward social mobility.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the certainty of employment was made the main criterion for selection under the new system.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The diagram displays the relative importance of various criteria used to select skilled immigrants; it provides no information about the total number or target level of immigrants Canada intended to admit. The chart is concerned with the *composition* and *qualifications* of the immigrant intake, not the *quantity*. Therefore, one cannot conclude whether the overall level of immigration was intended to be maintained, increased, or decreased.\n\n**B:** While the weighting for \"education\" as a standalone criterion decreased from approximately 25% to 9%, this does not mean Canada wanted fewer highly educated immigrants.

An unregulated monopolist would maximise profits by setting a price where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, resulting in a price that is considerably higher than its marginal and average costs. This leads to supernormal profits for the firm and a lower level of consumer surplus, a situation often described as monopolistic exploitation. A government-imposed maximum price, or price ceiling, can be set at a level closer to the firm's average cost.

It will encourage electricity suppliers to invest in additional capacity.**\n\nA maximum price reduces the potential revenue and profitability for electricity suppliers. Lower profits diminish the financial incentive for firms to undertake costly, long-term investments in building new power plants or upgrading the grid.

According to the law of demand, a lower price for a good or service leads to an increase in the quantity demanded, all other factors being equal. By reducing the cost of using electricity, a maximum price weakens the financial incentive for consumers to conserve energy. In fact, it is likely to encourage higher consumption.\n\n**D. It will prevent the rationing of electricity through power cuts.**\n\nAn effective maximum price is set below the market-clearing equilibrium level. At this lower price, the quantity of electricity demanded by consumers will exceed the quantity that suppliers are willing and able to provide, creating a shortage (excess demand). When a shortage exists and the price mechanism is not allowed to function, non-price rationing mechanisms must be used to allocate the scarce supply. For electricity, this often takes the form of planned power cuts (also known as brownouts or rolling blackouts). Therefore, a maximum price is a likely cause of rationing through power cuts, not a means of preventing it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_108.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "18 which statement best describes demand-induced investment?\na it is spending on capital goods by firms because the rate of growth in demand for final goods\nand services increases.\nb_itis spending on capital goods by firms because the cost of borrowing has fallen.\nc_ it is spending on capital goods by firms because they want to access new technology to\nimprove the output per worker.\nd_itis spending on new capital goods by firms replacing old and obsolete capital goods.", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nDemand-induced investment, often explained by the accelerator theory, describes the relationship between investment and the change in national income or demand. When the rate of growth in demand for final goods and services increases, firms anticipate needing a larger capital stock to meet this future demand. To expand their productive capacity, they increase their spending on capital goods (e.g., machinery, equipment, buildings). Therefore, net investment is a direct function of the growth in demand. If demand is growing, net investment will be positive; if demand is constant, net investment will be zero (though firms may still undertake replacement investment).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** This statement describes investment that is a function of the interest rate, which represents the cost of borrowing. A fall in the cost of borrowing makes investment projects more profitable, leading to an increase in investment spending. While the interest rate is a key determinant of investment, this mechanism is distinct from demand-induced investment, which is triggered by changes in aggregate demand, not the cost of finance.\n\n**C:** This statement describes investment driven by technological advancement.

This type of investment is often considered autonomous, meaning it occurs independently of changes in the current level of demand, and is instead motivated by innovation and the pursuit of efficiency.\n\n**D:** This statement describes replacement investment. Capital goods wear out or become obsolete over time, a process known as depreciation or capital consumption.

Energy is a fundamental input for nearly all economic activities, including manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture. Limiting the supply of essential fuels like oil and natural gas would create energy shortages and/or drive up energy prices in low-income countries. This would increase production costs for businesses, reduce industrial output, disrupt supply chains, and make it more difficult for the country to develop its infrastructure. Therefore, restricting access to energy would act as a significant constraint on economic development and growth, directly contradicting the stated goal of assisting these nations.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: assisting low-income countries to overcome foreign exchange shortages by writing off debts**\n\nThis policy would be likely to promote economic growth. Many low-income countries are burdened by substantial foreign debt, and the servicing of this debt (i.e., making interest and principal payments) consumes a significant portion of their government revenue and foreign exchange earnings. By writing off these debts, Middle Eastern countries would free up these financial resources. The low-income country's government could then reallocate these funds towards growth-promoting investments in education, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, thereby fostering long-term economic development.\n\n**B: enabling low-income countries to undertake capital projects for supplies of clean water through financial aid**\n\nThis policy is a direct form of development aid that would be very likely to promote economic growth. Access to clean water is a fundamental prerequisite for a healthy and productive population. Financial aid for such a capital project improves public health, reduces the incidence of waterborne diseases, and frees up labour (especially for women and children) that would otherwise be spent collecting water. A healthier and more educated workforce is more productive, and the development of basic infrastructure like water systems is a cornerstone of sustainable economic growth.\n\n**C: hiring mainly labour from low-income countries to build infrastructure in the Middle East**\n\nThis policy would be likely to support economic growth in low-income countries through the mechanism of remittances. When workers from low-income nations are employed abroad, they typically send a portion of their earnings back to their families. These remittances represent a major inflow of foreign currency for the home country, boosting its Gross National Income (GNI). Remittances increase household income, leading to higher consumption and investment, and can help alleviate poverty and fund education, all of which contribute positively to economic growth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_110.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "20 an open economy has injections, j, into the circular flow of income and withdrawals, w.\n\nfee ww\n\ninjections and\n\nwithdrawals\n\nss\n|\nos q e\nnational income\n\nif the full employment level of national income is oq, what represents the inflationary gap?\na qe brt c sr d st", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn inflationary gap occurs when the equilibrium level of national income is greater than the full employment level of national income.

In an open economy with a government sector, the value of the multiplier (k) is calculated as:\n\nk = 1 / (Marginal Propensity to Withdraw)\n\nor\n\nk = 1 / (MPS + MPT + MPM)\n\nwhere:\n*   **MPS** is the marginal propensity to save.\n*   **MPT** is the marginal tax rate.\n*   **MPM** is the marginal propensity to import.\n\nThese three components represent \"leakages\" from the circular flow of income. For the multiplier to be as high as possible, the denominator (the sum of the marginal propensities to withdraw) must be as small as possible. This means that the leakages from the circular flow of income must be minimised.\n\nA **low marginal propensity to import (MPM)** means that when individuals receive additional income, they spend a smaller proportion of it on foreign goods and services.

A lower MPM reduces the size of the denominator in the multiplier formula, thus yielding a higher multiplier value.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A. high average and marginal tax rates:** A high marginal tax rate (MPT) means that a larger fraction of any additional income is paid to the government in taxes. This represents a significant leakage from the circular flow of income. A higher MPT increases the value of the denominator in the multiplier formula, which in turn leads to a smaller national income multiplier. The average tax rate is not the key determinant; the marginal rate is what affects the size of the multiplier.\n\n*   **B. high marginal propensity to save:** A high marginal propensity to save (MPS) indicates that individuals will save a larger portion of any additional income they receive. Savings are considered a leakage from the circular flow of income because this money is not immediately spent on goods and services. A higher MPS increases the size of the denominator in the multiplier formula, thereby reducing the value of the multiplier.\n\n*   **C. low level of autonomous consumption:** Autonomous consumption is the amount of consumption expenditure that occurs when income is zero.

It is the temporary unemployment that occurs when individuals are in the process of moving from one job to another, or when they are entering the labour force for the first time (e.g., after graduating). This type of unemployment is classified as voluntary because it stems from the individual choices of workers. For example, a worker may voluntarily quit their job to search for a better one with higher pay, better working conditions, or one that is a better match for their skills. While they are searching, they are frictionally unemployed. This process is a natural and often beneficial part of a dynamic economy, allowing for a better allocation of labour resources.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Cyclical unemployment** is involuntary. It is caused by a downturn in the business cycle, specifically a recession or economic slump. When aggregate demand in the economy falls, businesses reduce production and lay off workers to cut costs. These workers are willing and able to work at the prevailing wage rates but cannot find employment due to the overall lack of demand in the economy. Therefore, their unemployment is a direct result of macroeconomic conditions, not a personal choice.\n\n**C. Structural unemployment** is involuntary. This form of unemployment arises from a fundamental mismatch between the skills possessed by the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. It is typically caused by long-term changes in the structure of an economy, such as the decline of a major industry (e.g., coal mining or steel production) or significant geographical shifts in industrial activity. The workers affected are unemployed because their skills are no longer in demand, and they cannot find work without significant retraining or relocation. Their unemployment is a consequence of deep-seated economic shifts, not a voluntary decision.\n\n**D. Technological unemployment** is a specific form of structural unemployment and is therefore involuntary. It occurs when advancements in technology, such as automation or artificial intelligence, render certain jobs obsolete, displacing the workers who previously performed them. These individuals are unemployed because their roles have been replaced by machines or new processes. They are willing to work, but their specific job has been eliminated by technological progress, making their unemployment involuntary."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_113.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "23 increased borrowing by the government results in higher interest charges and this leads to less\nprivate investment expenditure.\nof what is this an example?\naan automatic stabiliser\nb crowding out\nc_ the accelerator\nd_ the substitution effect", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe phenomenon described is a classic example of **crowding out**. Crowding out occurs when increased government borrowing to finance a budget deficit reduces the funds available for private investment. The mechanism is as follows:\n1.  The government increases its borrowing by selling government bonds in the financial markets.\n2.  This increased demand for loanable funds shifts the demand curve for funds to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium interest rate.\n3.  The higher interest rate increases the cost of borrowing for private firms. As a result, firms find fewer investment projects profitable and reduce their investment expenditure.\nEssentially, the government's borrowing \"crowds out\" private investment by competing for the same pool of savings and driving up the price of borrowing (the interest rate).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an automatic stabiliser:**\nAn automatic stabiliser refers to a feature of the fiscal system that automatically dampens the fluctuations of the business cycle without any new discretionary government action. Examples include progressive income taxes and unemployment benefits. During an economic expansion, tax revenues automatically rise and benefit payments fall, cooling the economy. Conversely, during a recession, tax revenues fall and benefit payments rise, stimulating the economy. The scenario described in the question is a consequence of a discretionary government decision to increase borrowing, not an automatic fiscal response.\n\n**C. the accelerator:**\nThe accelerator principle describes the relationship between the rate of change in national income (or consumption) and the level of net investment. It suggests that a change in the rate of economic growth will lead to a magnified change in investment. For instance, if the economy starts growing at a faster rate, firms will invest heavily to expand their capacity to meet expected future demand. The cause described in the question is increased government borrowing and rising interest rates, not a change in the rate of growth of national income.\n\n**D. the substitution effect:**\nThe substitution effect is a microeconomic concept that describes how consumers react to a change in the price of a good by substituting it with other, now relatively cheaper, goods. While there is a substitution element in crowding out (firms substitute away from investment as its cost rises), \"crowding out\" is the specific macroeconomic term for the entire process where government fiscal policy displaces private sector activity, particularly investment, via the interest rate mechanism. The substitution effect is a more general principle and does not specifically describe this macroeconomic interaction."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_114.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "24 governments set economic policy aims.\nwhat will be least likely to occur if all these aims are achieved?\na adecrease in the average standard of living\nb adecrease in the currency\u2019s foreign exchange rate\nc_anincrease in the level of frictional unemployment\nd_anincrease in the rate of inflation", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**A. a decrease in the average standard of living**\n\nThis is the correct answer because it is the most fundamentally contradictory outcome to the successful achievement of a government's main economic policy aims. The primary purpose of macroeconomic management is to improve the economic well-being and welfare of a country's citizens, which is synonymous with increasing the average standard of living.\n\nThe main economic aims of a government typically include:\n1.  **Sustainable Economic Growth:** An increase in the country's real output (Real GDP), which means more goods and services are available per person.\n2.  **Low Unemployment:** Ensuring that most people who are willing and able to work have a job and a source of income.\n3.  **Price Stability (Low Inflation):** Maintaining the purchasing power of money, so that people's incomes and savings are not eroded.\n4.  **A Satisfactory Balance of Payments:** Managing international trade and financial flows to ensure currency stability and national solvency.\n\nIf all these aims were achieved, the economy would experience rising output, high employment, and stable prices. This combination would almost certainly lead to an **increase**, not a decrease, in the average standard of living. A decrease in the standard of living would signify a comprehensive failure of economic policy, making it the least likely result of achieving all policy aims.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**B. a decrease in the currency's foreign exchange rate**\n\nWhile a stable or appreciating currency is often a sign of a strong economy, a government might sometimes deliberately pursue a policy to achieve a lower exchange rate (depreciation). This policy, known as expenditure-switching, can make a country's exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can help to reduce a trade deficit and boost domestic production and employment. Therefore, achieving a balance of payments aim could, in some circumstances, involve a decrease in the exchange rate. As it can be a deliberate policy tool, it is not the least likely outcome.\n\n**C. an increase in the level of frictional unemployment**\n\nFrictional unemployment is the short-term unemployment that occurs when people are in the process of moving between jobs. It is considered a natural and even healthy feature of a dynamic economy. If a government successfully achieves its aim of strong economic growth, this would likely lead to the creation of new jobs and opportunities. This vibrant labour market would encourage more people to leave their current positions to seek better ones, thus temporarily increasing the level of frictional unemployment. Consequently, an increase in frictional unemployment can be a byproduct of a successfully growing economy and is therefore a plausible occurrence.\n\n**D. an increase in the rate of inflation**\n\nAchieving price stability, meaning a low and stable rate of inflation, is a core economic aim. Therefore, if all aims are achieved, an increase in the rate of inflation is, by definition, an unlikely event as it would mean the price stability objective has failed. However, it is not the *least* likely outcome compared to a fall in the standard of living. A fall in the standard of living represents a failure of the most fundamental goals of economic policy (growth and employment), whereas an increase in inflation represents the failure of just one specific goal. The achievement of other goals like growth and employment is what drives the standard of living upwards, making its decrease the most profound contradiction."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_115.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "25 the government decides to raise the rate of value added tax (general sales tax).\nwhat does this suggest is the government's main macroeconomic objective?\nato reduce the budget deficit\nb_ to reduce the inequality of income distribution\nc_ to reduce the level of unemployment\nd_ to reduce the rate of inflation", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nRaising the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT), an indirect tax on goods and services, directly increases the government's tax revenue. A budget deficit occurs when government expenditure is greater than its revenue. By increasing its revenue through a higher VAT rate, the government can close the gap between its spending and income, thereby reducing the budget deficit. This is a primary application of contractionary fiscal policy aimed at improving the government's fiscal position.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. to reduce the inequality of income distribution**\n\nThis objective is incorrect because a Value Added Tax is generally considered a regressive tax. A regressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals than from higher-income individuals. This is because lower-income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their total income on consumption, while higher-income households save a larger proportion. Therefore, raising the rate of VAT would disproportionately affect the poor, leading to an *increase*, not a reduction, in income inequality.\n\n**C. to reduce the level of unemployment**\n\nThis objective is incorrect. Raising the VAT rate is a form of contractionary fiscal policy. It increases the final price of goods and services, which reduces the real disposable income and purchasing power of consumers. This leads to a decrease in consumption, a major component of aggregate demand. A fall in aggregate demand would likely lead to a reduction in national output and an *increase* in cyclical unemployment as firms cut back on production and lay off workers. Policies to reduce unemployment typically involve expansionary fiscal measures, such as cutting taxes or increasing government spending to boost aggregate demand.\n\n**D. to reduce the rate of inflation**\n\nWhile raising VAT could be considered as a tool to combat demand-pull inflation, its overall effect on the price level is ambiguous and potentially counterproductive. On one hand, by reducing consumption and aggregate demand, a higher VAT can alleviate demand-pull inflationary pressures. On the other hand, VAT is an indirect tax paid by producers and passed on to consumers. An increase in the VAT rate directly raises firms' costs and, consequently, the prices of goods and services. This creates a cost-push effect on the price level, which could worsen inflation in the short run. Given this dual and contradictory impact, it is a less direct and certain tool for reducing inflation compared to its direct effect on government revenue.

Consequently, it takes more units of the domestic currency to purchase one unit of a foreign currency.\n\n*   **Effect on the price of imported goods:** When the domestic currency depreciates, the cost of purchasing goods and services from other countries increases. For example, if a machine costs US$100, and the exchange rate moves from \u00a31 = US$2 to \u00a31 = US$1.50 (a depreciation of the pound), the cost in pounds rises from \u00a350 to approximately \u00a366.67.

However, it incorrectly suggests that the price of exported goods will fall.

An increase in the overall HDI value, as seen for India from 0.60 in 2014 to 0.64 in 2020, indicates an improvement in at least one of these dimensions. The 'knowledge' dimension is measured by two indicators: the mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more, and the expected years of schooling for children of school-entering age. A rise in the mean years of schooling directly contributes to an increase in the education component of the HDI and, consequently, to the overall HDI value. Therefore, it is a highly probable conclusion that an improvement in educational attainment occurred during this period.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This conclusion is unlikely. The 'long and healthy life' dimension of the HDI is measured by life expectancy at birth. A fall in life expectancy would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in the HDI value, assuming other components remain constant. While it is theoretically possible for very large improvements in education and income to outweigh a small decline in life expectancy, a fall in a key component is inconsistent with the overall trend of improvement shown by the rising HDI.\n\n**B:** This conclusion is unlikely. The 'decent standard of living' dimension of the HDI is measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity). A fall in real national income per head would exert downward pressure on the HDI.

The initial worsening of the current account, which creates the dip in the \"J\", is primarily explained by time lags in the response of consumers and firms to the change in relative prices.\n\nIn the short term, the demand for both imports and exports tends to be price inelastic. This is due to several lags:\n1.  **Recognition Lag:** It takes time for buyers (both domestic and foreign) to become aware that the exchange rate, and therefore the relative prices of goods, have changed.\n2.  **Contractual Lag:** Many import and export orders are based on pre-existing contracts. These contractual obligations mean that the volume of goods traded does not adjust immediately to the new prices.\n3.  **Decision and Delivery Lag:** Even after recognising the price change and being free from contracts, it takes time for firms to find new, cheaper domestic substitutes for imports or for foreign buyers to switch to the now-cheaper exports.\n\nBecause the quantity (volume) of imports and exports changes very little in the short run, the initial impact is dominated by the price effect. A depreciation makes each unit of import more expensive in the domestic currency. With the volume of imports remaining stable, the total import bill rises. This increase in import expenditure, without a corresponding immediate rise in export revenue, causes the current account deficit to worsen. Only later, as demand becomes more elastic and the volume of exports rises while the volume of imports falls, does the current account begin to improve.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: an improvement in the quality of goods produced**\nAn improvement in the quality of domestically produced goods is a non-price factor that could lead to an increase in exports and an improvement in the current account. However, this is a long-term supply-side factor and is not a direct or immediate consequence of a currency depreciation. The J-curve specifically models the dynamic effects of a *price change* (via the exchange rate) over time, not changes in product quality.\n\n**C: the demand for imports and exports is elastic in the short run**\nThis statement is the direct opposite of the condition required for the J-curve effect to occur. If the demand for imports and exports were elastic in the short run, a currency depreciation would lead to an immediate and significant improvement in the current account. A fall in the exchange rate makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive. With elastic demand, the quantity of exports would rise more than proportionally, and the quantity of imports would fall more than proportionally, causing the current account balance to improve straight away. The J-curve exists precisely because demand is *inelastic* in the short run.\n\n**D: the supply of goods is price elastic**\nThe elasticity of supply for exports is a relevant factor, but it does not explain the initial worsening of the current account. An elastic supply of goods means that domestic producers can readily increase output to meet the higher foreign demand that eventually results from the depreciation. This facilitates the upward-sloping, improvement phase of the J-curve.

A high Gini coefficient signifies substantial income inequality, which is less common in the most highly developed nations that typically have more effective redistributive policies and social safety nets. While a large tertiary sector is a sign of development, the high inequality suggests a less balanced or mature stage of development.\n\n**B:** This country is unlikely to be highly developed due to the low relative size of its tertiary sector.

The most fundamental of these is the assumption of **rationality**. In this context, rationality means that a consumer has a consistent set of preferences and acts to maximise their utility (satisfaction) given their income and the prices of goods. This satisfaction-maximising objective is a constant, foundational assumption of the entire theory. The consumer is always assumed to be seeking the highest possible indifference curve that their budget constraint allows them to reach. The model does not analyse situations where the consumer might abandon this objective or act irrationally. Therefore, the proposition that a consumer may change their satisfaction-maximising objective is incorrect as it violates a core axiom of the theory.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The consumer's income may change.**\nThis statement is consistent with indifference curve analysis. A key application of the model is to examine the impact of changes in income on consumer choice. A change in income causes a parallel shift in the budget line. By observing how the consumer's optimal bundle changes in response to these shifts, economists can derive the income-consumption curve (ICC) and distinguish between normal and inferior goods.\n\n**C: The consumers may change their tastes and preferences.**\nWhile an indifference map is drawn for a given set of tastes and preferences, the framework can be used to analyse the effect of a change in these preferences. A change in taste for one good over another would be represented by a change in the shape and position of the entire indifference map (for instance, the indifference curves might become steeper or flatter, reflecting a change in the marginal rate of substitution). This would lead to a new optimal consumption point. Therefore, the model can accommodate and analyse the consequences of a change in consumer preferences.\n\n**D: The relative prices of products may change.**\nThis is a central element of indifference curve analysis. The theory is used extensively to break down the effect of a price change into its two components: the substitution effect and the income effect. A change in the price of one good alters the slope of the budget line (which represents the relative prices of the two products), causing it to pivot.

Allocative efficiency:**\nAllocative efficiency is achieved when resources are distributed in a way that maximizes social welfare, which occurs at the output level where price equals marginal cost (P=MC). The provided graph only shows long-run average cost curves and contains no information about the product's price, the market demand curve, or the firm's marginal cost curve.

While related to allocative efficiency, it is a broader concept concerning overall economic welfare. The diagram only illustrates a change in a single firm's cost structure and does not provide the necessary information about consumer utility or the welfare of other agents in the economy to make a judgment about Pareto efficiency.\n\n**D. Productive efficiency:**\nProductive efficiency occurs when a firm produces its output at the lowest possible point on its average cost curve. For a given LRAC curve, productive efficiency is achieved at its minimum point. While the downward shift to LRAC\u2082 creates the potential for the firm to achieve a new, lower level of productive efficiency, the shift of the curve itself represents the process of improvement over time. This process is defined as dynamic efficiency.

Marginal revenue is the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of output. As long as the marginal revenue is positive (MR > 0), selling an additional unit will increase the firm's total revenue. Conversely, if marginal revenue becomes negative (MR < 0), selling an additional unit will cause total revenue to fall. Therefore, total revenue reaches its highest point when selling one more unit adds nothing to the total, which is the point where marginal revenue is precisely zero. This corresponds to the peak of the total revenue curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. average cost = average revenue**\nThe condition where average cost (AC) equals average revenue (AR) is the break-even point. At this level of output, the firm's total revenue is exactly equal to its total cost, resulting in zero economic profit (or normal profit). The firm is covering all of its explicit and implicit costs but is not maximising its revenue. Revenue is typically maximised at a different, often higher, level of output than the break-even point.\n\n**B. marginal cost = average revenue**\nThe condition where marginal cost (MC) equals average revenue (AR) represents the point of allocative efficiency. Since average revenue is equal to price (P), this condition is P = MC. It means that the price consumers are willing to pay for the last unit of a good is equal to the marginal cost of producing it. This outcome maximises social welfare but is not the objective of a firm seeking to maximise its own revenue.\n\n**C. marginal cost = marginal revenue**\nThe condition where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR) is the rule for profit maximisation. A firm maximises its total profit by producing up to the quantity where the revenue from the last unit sold (MR) is equal to the cost of producing that last unit (MC). This objective focuses on maximising the difference between total revenue and total cost, which is a different goal from simply maximising total revenue, and it is almost always achieved at a lower quantity of output than revenue maximisation."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_126.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "6 the costs and revenue of four firms operating in a monopolistically competitive market are\nshown.\ntotal total total\nfirm variable cost fixed cost revenue\n$m $m $m\nww 20 10 15\nx 40 50 80\ny 300 300 500\nz 600 100 550\nwhich firms will continue to operate in the short run but will shut down in the long run?\na xandwww b xandy c wandz d yandz", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA firm's decision to operate or shut down depends on its ability to cover its costs with its revenue, and the rules for this decision differ between the short run and the long run.\n\n*   **Short-Run Decision:** In the short run, a firm will continue to operate as long as its total revenue (TR) is sufficient to cover its total variable costs (TVC). Fixed costs are considered sunk costs in the short run and must be paid regardless of the level of output. Therefore, as long as TR \u2265 TVC, the firm minimises its losses by operating, as any revenue above variable costs can contribute to paying fixed costs. If TR < TVC, the firm should shut down immediately to avoid incurring further losses on each unit produced.\n*   **Long-Run Decision:** In the long run, all costs are variable, and a firm must cover all its costs to remain viable. A firm will exit the market (shut down) if it is making an economic loss, which occurs when its total revenue (TR) is less than its total cost (TC). Total cost is the sum of total variable cost and total fixed cost (TC = TVC + TFC).\n\nApplying these principles to the firms:\n\n*   **Firm X:**\n    *   Short Run: TR ($80m) > TVC ($40m).

The question requires firms that operate in the short run.\n\n**D: Y and Z**\nThis option is incorrect because of Firm Z. For Firm Z, its total revenue ($550m) is less than its total variable cost ($600m). This means the firm incurs additional losses for every unit produced.

By taking over its main competitor, steel producer X eliminates a key alternative for its customers. With fewer substitute suppliers in the market, consumers have less choice. Consequently, demand for firm X's steel becomes less responsive to price changes. A price increase will now lead to a smaller proportionate fall in quantity demanded than before the merger. This means the price elasticity of demand for its product will decrease (i.e., become more inelastic).\n\n*   **Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC):** The merger results in a significant increase in the scale of production for firm X. This larger scale allows the firm to benefit from various economies of scale. For example, the combined entity can engage in bulk purchasing of raw materials (like iron ore and coking coal) at lower prices (purchasing economies), rationalise production by closing less efficient plants and concentrating output in more efficient ones (technical economies), and secure finance at more favourable interest rates (financial economies). These efficiencies lead to a reduction in the cost per unit of output, causing the long-run average cost to decrease.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B:** While it is correct that the price elasticity of demand will decrease due to fewer competitors, it is incorrect to assume that the long-run average cost will increase. An increase in LRAC would imply that the firm experiences diseconomies of scale. Although this is possible if the merged firm becomes too large and difficult to manage, the primary motivation and expected outcome of such a takeover is to achieve cost synergies and efficiencies through economies of scale, leading to lower, not higher, average costs.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly states that the price elasticity of demand will increase. An increase in PED would imply that demand becomes more sensitive to price changes. This would typically occur if the number of competitors or substitutes increased, which is the opposite of what happens in a takeover of a main competitor. While the expectation of a decrease in long-run average cost is plausible due to economies of scale, the premise regarding PED is flawed.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect on both counts. As explained for option C, the price elasticity of demand is expected to decrease, not increase, because the number of substitutes for consumers is reduced.

The cost is not borne by the producer or consumer responsible for creating it. Road congestion is a classic example of an external cost. When a firm uses a truck for delivery or an individual drives a car, they contribute to traffic. This imposes costs on other road users (the third parties) in the form of increased travel time, higher fuel consumption, and greater stress. The firm or individual causing the incremental congestion does not directly compensate the other road users for these costs. Therefore, the social cost of using the road is higher than the private cost to the individual user, representing a market failure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) distribution costs**\nDistribution costs are the expenses incurred by a firm to deliver its products to the end consumer. These include transportation, warehousing, and handling fees.

Alternatively, it can be calculated as the sum of private welfare (consumer surplus + producer surplus) minus the total external cost.\n\n1.  **Socially Optimal Output:** The socially optimal level of output occurs where the marginal social benefit (MSB) equals the marginal social cost (MSC). Assuming no external benefits, the demand curve (D) represents the MSB. The socially optimal output is therefore at the intersection of the D and MSC curves.\n2.  **Maximum Net Social Benefit:** At this socially optimal output level, the net social benefit is maximised.

For every unit produced beyond the social optimum, the marginal social cost (MSC) is higher than the marginal social benefit (MSB). This overproduction results in a net loss to society's welfare, known as a deadweight loss. This deadweight loss is the area between the MSC and MSB curves for the range of output from the social optimum to OQ. In the diagram, this welfare loss is represented by the area **y**.\n5.  **Calculating NSB at OQ:** The net social benefit at the market output OQ is the maximum possible net social benefit (achieved at the optimal output) minus the deadweight loss incurred from overproducing.\n    *   NSB at OQ = Maximum NSB - Deadweight Loss\n    *   NSB at OQ = **x - y**\n\nTherefore, the area that measures the net social benefit at output OQ is **x - y**.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. x**\n\nThis is incorrect. The area **x** represents the maximum possible net social benefit, which is achieved only at the socially optimal level of output (where MSC = MSB).

Since OQ is greater than the socially optimal output (due to the negative externality), there is a welfare loss from overproduction. This means the net social benefit at OQ must be less than the maximum possible, so it cannot be **x**.\n\n**C. x + y**\n\nThis is incorrect. The area **x** represents the maximum social surplus, while the area **y** represents the deadweight loss to society from producing at OQ instead of the social optimum. A deadweight loss is a reduction in total surplus. Adding the welfare loss (**y**) to the maximum possible surplus (**x**) is economically illogical and does not represent any meaningful measure of welfare.\n\n**D. x - y - z**\n\nThis is incorrect. The net social benefit at output OQ is correctly calculated as **x - y**. Subtracting area **z** is not justified. Area **z**, together with area **x**, represents the total private surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) at output OQ. However, area **z** is also part of the total external cost (represented by **y + z**). When calculating net social benefit as (Private Surplus) - (External Cost), the calculation is (x + z) - (y + z), which simplifies to **x - y**. Subtracting **z** an additional time from this result has no economic basis."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_131.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "11. what would definitely result from the divorce of ownership and control?\na_ decreased moral hazard\nb the principal agent problem\nc greater productive efficiency\nd increased profit maximisation", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe 'divorce of ownership and control' describes a situation, common in large corporations, where the owners of the firm (the shareholders, or principals) are a separate group from those who make the day-to-day decisions (the directors and managers, or agents). This separation inherently creates the **principal-agent problem**. This problem arises from a conflict of interest between the two parties, coupled with asymmetric information (where managers have more information about the company's operations than shareholders do). The principals (shareholders) typically want to maximise profits to increase the value of their shares and dividends. However, the agents (managers) may have different objectives, such as maximising their own salaries, bonuses, job security, or the size of the firm (revenue or sales maximisation), which do not necessarily align with profit maximisation. Because the principals cannot perfectly monitor the agents' actions, the agents can pursue their own objectives, potentially at the expense of the principals' interests.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) decreased moral hazard:** This is incorrect. Moral hazard occurs when an agent takes on more risk because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions. The divorce of ownership and control *increases* moral hazard. Managers might pursue high-risk strategies because if they succeed, they receive large bonuses, but if they fail, the financial losses are borne primarily by the shareholders. This separation of risk from decision-making encourages, rather than discourages, such behaviour.\n\n**C) greater productive efficiency:** This is unlikely and certainly not a definite result. Productive efficiency is achieved when output is produced at the lowest possible average cost. The principal-agent problem can lead to productive *inefficiency*. Managers who are not owners may have weaker incentives to control costs rigorously. This can lead to 'organisational slack', where costs are higher than necessary due to excessive spending on perks, overstaffing, or a general lack of cost-consciousness, as managers do not directly bear these costs.\n\n**D) increased profit maximisation:** This is incorrect. Profit maximisation is the primary objective of the owners (shareholders). The divorce of ownership and control makes it *less* likely that the firm will strictly pursue profit maximisation. As explained by the principal-agent problem, managers may prioritise other goals, such as sales revenue maximisation (which often determines their bonuses) or company growth (which increases their prestige and power), over maximising profits for shareholders. They might engage in 'satisficing'\u2014making just enough profit to keep shareholders satisfied, while using remaining resources to pursue their own objectives."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_132.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "12 one reason for market failure is the existence of public goods.\nwhich policy option is appropriate for addressing such a market failure?\na direct provision of the good by the government\nb __ provision of detailed information to consumers\nc _ subsidising firms that currently produce the good\nd_ the adoption of maximum price controls", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA public good is defined by two key characteristics: it is **non-excludable** (it is impossible to prevent individuals from consuming it, even if they don't pay) and **non-rivalrous** (one person's consumption does not diminish the amount available for others). Examples include national defence, street lighting, and flood control systems.\n\nThe existence of public goods leads to market failure because of the **free-rider problem**. Since individuals cannot be excluded from benefiting from the good, they have no incentive to pay for it voluntarily. Consequently, private firms have no profit motive to supply the good, as they cannot charge consumers for its use. This results in the good being under-provided or not provided at all by the free market.\n\nThe most appropriate policy to address this specific market failure is the **direct provision of the good by the government**. The government can overcome the free-rider problem by funding the provision of the public good through compulsory taxation. It can then either produce the good itself or contract a private firm to do so, ensuring that the socially desirable good is available to the public.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: provision of detailed information to consumers**\n\nThis policy is designed to correct market failures arising from **asymmetric information**, where one party in a transaction (usually the consumer) has less information than the other. Providing information helps consumers make more rational and informed choices. However, this does not solve the fundamental free-rider problem associated with public goods. Even with perfect information about the benefits of a public good, consumers still lack the incentive to pay for it voluntarily, and firms still lack a mechanism to charge for its provision.\n\n**C: subsidising firms that currently produce the good**\n\nSubsidies are typically used to correct the under-consumption of **merit goods** or goods with significant **positive externalities**. A subsidy lowers the cost of production for private firms, encouraging them to increase supply and lower the price for consumers. The core issue with pure public goods, however, is that there are often no private firms \"that currently produce the good\" because it is not profitable to do so. The market does not exist to be subsidised. Therefore, a subsidy is not the primary or most direct solution.\n\n**D: the adoption of maximum price controls**\n\nA maximum price, or price ceiling, is a government-imposed limit on how high a price can be charged for a good. This policy is typically implemented to make essential goods more affordable or to curb the market power of monopolies. Applying a price ceiling to a public good would be counterproductive. The problem with public goods is non-provision due to a lack of profitability, not excessively high prices. A price ceiling would further reduce any potential revenue and disincentivise production, exacerbating the market failure rather than correcting it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_133.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "13 in 2020, the governor of california issued an order to ban the sale of new vehicles from 2035 that\nare powered by petrol or diesel fuel.\nwhich type of government policy is this?\na anudge\nb- apermit to pollute\nc nationalisation\nd_ regulation", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D - regulation\n\nA regulation is a rule or directive made and maintained by an authority. In economics, government regulation refers to the use of laws and rules to control or influence the behaviour of firms and individuals. The order issued by the governor of California is a clear example of regulation because it is a legally binding directive that explicitly prohibits a specific economic activity\u2014the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles\u2014from a future date. This type of \"command-and-control\" policy sets a strict standard that must be met, directly intervening in the market to achieve a policy goal, in this case, environmental protection.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A - a nudge**\nA nudge is a concept in behavioural economics where positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions are used to influence behaviour and decision-making without forbidding any options or significantly changing economic incentives. Nudge policies aim to steer people in a particular direction while preserving their freedom of choice. An outright ban, such as prohibiting the sale of certain vehicles, is a forceful mandate that eliminates choice. Therefore, this policy is a command, not a nudge.\n\n**B - a permit to pollute**\nA permit to pollute is a market-based policy instrument, often part of a cap-and-trade system. Under this system, a government sets a cap on the total level of a certain pollutant and issues a corresponding number of permits. Firms can then buy, sell, or trade these permits. This creates a market for pollution rights and incentivises firms to reduce pollution efficiently. The policy described is a direct ban on a product, not a system that creates a market for the right to pollute.\n\n**C - nationalisation**\nNationalisation is the process of a government taking ownership and control of a private industry, company, or asset. This policy would involve the state taking over car manufacturing companies. The order in question does not involve a transfer of ownership; it only regulates what kind of products private companies are allowed to sell within California's market.

In the absence of any government intervention, this occurs at the quantity Q\u2082. To hire Q\u2082 workers, the monopsonist only needs to offer the wage rate indicated by the supply of labour curve (S = ACL) at that quantity. This corresponds to the wage rate W\u2081. Therefore, the wage the monopsonist *wishes* to pay is W\u2081.\n\nHowever, the government has imposed a minimum wage at W\u2082. Since W\u2082 is above the monopsonist's preferred wage of W\u2081, the firm is legally obligated to pay this higher wage. With the minimum wage in place, the wage received by the labour employed is W\u2082. The quantity of labour hired will now be Q\u2081, where the new effective wage (the minimum wage) intersects the demand for labour (D = MRP).\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the wage the monopsonist wishes to pay (W\u2081) and the wage actually received by labour (W\u2082). This difference is the range between these two wage levels, which is correctly identified as W\u2081W\u2082.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A - W\u2081W\u2083:** This is incorrect. W\u2083 represents the marginal cost of hiring the Q\u2082nd worker, not the wage that would be paid.

A profit-maximising firm will continue to hire labour as long as the revenue generated by the additional worker (MRP_L) is greater than or equal to the cost of hiring that worker (the wage rate, or Marginal Cost of Labour).

While the ARP_L is a useful measure, indicating the average revenue generated per worker, it does not determine the firm's demand for labour. Hiring decisions are made at the margin, based on the contribution of the *next* potential employee, not the average contribution of all employees.

Norway is more likely to have a progressive tax system and public sector pensions than India.**\n\nThis conclusion is correct. The Lorenz curve for Norway (N) is closer to the line of perfect equality than the Lorenz curve for India (I). This indicates that the distribution of income is significantly more equal in Norway than in India.\n\nGreater income equality is typically the result of government policies aimed at redistributing income from higher earners to lower earners.\n*   **A progressive tax system** is one where the proportion of income paid in tax rises as income increases. This directly reduces the gap between high and low post-tax incomes, making the overall distribution more equal.\n*   **Public sector pensions** are a form of transfer payment, providing income to the elderly, who might otherwise have very low or no income. This supports the incomes of a significant portion of the population, thereby reducing inequality.\n\nGiven Norway's more equal income distribution, it is logical to conclude that it employs stronger redistributive policies, such as a highly progressive tax system and a comprehensive public pension scheme, compared to India.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. India is more likely to have lower indirect taxes and a public sector education system than Norway.**\n\nThis statement is unlikely to be correct. While a public sector education system can promote equality of opportunity and long-term income equality, the Lorenz curve shows that India has a much higher level of current income inequality than Norway. This suggests that its redistributive mechanisms, as a whole, are less effective. Furthermore, developing economies like India often rely more heavily on indirect taxes (which can be regressive, taking a larger percentage of income from the poor) for government revenue, as they are often easier to collect than direct income taxes. Therefore, it is improbable that India has lower indirect taxes than Norway.\n\n**B. India is more likely to have a progressive income tax system and means-tested benefits than Norway.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A progressive income tax system and means-tested benefits (transfer payments targeted at the poor) are key policies for reducing income inequality. The diagram clearly shows that India has a *less* equal income distribution than Norway. It is, therefore, the more equal country, Norway, that is more likely to have a more effective and extensive system of progressive taxation and benefits, not India.\n\n**D. Norway is likely to have a higher percentage of tax generated from indirect taxes and privately funded pensions than India.**\n\nThis is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, a heavy reliance on indirect taxes (such as VAT or sales tax) can be regressive, meaning they tend to worsen income inequality. A country like Norway, with a high degree of income equality, is more likely to rely on progressive direct taxes. Secondly, a system dominated by privately funded pensions would likely increase income inequality, as higher-income individuals are able to save more for retirement, leading to greater disparities in pension income. A more equal society like Norway is more likely to have a robust, universal public pension system to ensure a baseline standard of living for all retirees."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_137.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "17 a reason for government intervention in the workings of the economy is to attempt to correct a\nmarket failure. sometimes, though, government failure may occur.\nwhat is not a possible reason for government failure?\na governments may have to make decisions on the basis of out-of-date information.\nb governments may make decisions that reduce negative externalities.\nc_ the extent of the market failure may be difficult to judge.\nd when circumstances change, a government may be unable to respond quickly.", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA government decision that successfully reduces negative externalities is an example of a successful government intervention, not a government failure. Government failure occurs when intervention leads to a misallocation of resources or a net welfare loss. The primary objective of government intervention in cases of market failure, such as the presence of negative externalities (e.g., pollution), is to correct the market outcome and improve social welfare. Therefore, an action that achieves this goal is the opposite of government failure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Governments may have to make decisions on the basis of out-of-date information.**\nThis is a significant cause of government failure known as an information gap. Economic data on key variables like GDP, inflation, and unemployment are collected and published with a time lag. Policies formulated using this old data may be inappropriate for the current economic conditions, leading to inefficient outcomes. For example, a government might implement an expansionary fiscal policy based on data showing a recession, but by the time the policy takes effect, the economy may already be in a recovery phase, causing the policy to be inflationary.\n\n**C. The extent of the market failure may be difficult to judge.**\nThis is another form of information failure that can lead to government failure. To effectively correct a market failure, such as a negative externality, the government must accurately quantify its magnitude. For instance, to set an optimal Pigouvian tax on a polluting activity, the government needs to estimate the monetary value of the external cost. This valuation is often difficult and imprecise. If the government overestimates or underestimates the extent of the market failure, the resulting policy will be suboptimal, leading to a misallocation of resources and a net welfare loss, which constitutes government failure.\n\n**D. When circumstances change, a government may be unable to respond quickly.**\nThis is a common reason for government failure related to administrative and political time lags. The policy-making process, from problem recognition to implementation, can be lengthy and cumbersome due to bureaucratic procedures, political debates, and legislative processes. During this period, the economic conditions the policy was designed to address may have changed significantly.

This policy promotes aquaculture (fish farming) as an alternative to traditional sea fishing. By subsidising the creation of fish farms, the government encourages a shift in production methods. This transition reduces the pressure on wild fish populations in the sea, mitigating the risk of overfishing and resource depletion. Consequently, wild stocks can be maintained at a healthy, sustainable level, while the overall output of the fishing industry (now comprising both capture fisheries and aquaculture) can grow. This approach directly addresses the environmental constraints on the industry, allowing for long-term economic expansion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Providing more modern fishing boats with larger nets would significantly increase the fishing fleet's capacity. While this might lead to short-term growth in the volume of fish caught, it would accelerate the depletion of wild fish stocks. This practice of over-exploitation is inherently unsustainable, as it would likely lead to a collapse of the fish population and, consequently, the long-term decline of the industry.\n\n**B:** Paying bonuses for larger fish catches creates a direct financial incentive for fishermen to maximise their harvest from the sea. This would encourage intensive fishing practices and exacerbate the problem of overfishing. Such a policy prioritises short-term output over the long-term health of the marine ecosystem, making it a clear example of an unsustainable strategy that would ultimately harm the industry.\n\n**C:** Setting up a fish cooperative would increase the market power of fishermen, potentially allowing them to secure higher prices for their catch. While this would improve the profitability and income of those in the industry, it does not address the fundamental issue of resource management.

Furthermore, it may have negative consequences, such as forcing workers into jobs that are a poor match for their skills, leading to lower productivity and job satisfaction, or causing financial hardship.\n\n**C. reduce tax rates**\n\nReducing tax rates is an expansionary fiscal policy primarily aimed at stimulating aggregate demand. While lower income taxes might increase the incentive to work and lower corporation taxes might encourage firms to hire, this policy primarily targets cyclical unemployment (unemployment due to a lack of demand in the economy). It does not directly improve the efficiency of the job search and matching process, which is the key driver of frictional unemployment.\n\n**D. raise interest rates**\n\nRaising interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy used to curb inflation by reducing aggregate demand. This policy makes borrowing more expensive for firms and consumers, leading to decreased investment and spending. Consequently, economic activity slows down, and firms are likely to create fewer jobs or even lay off workers. This would increase cyclical unemployment and make it harder for those frictionally unemployed to find new jobs, thereby lengthening the job search period, not reducing it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_142.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "22 in a closed economy with no government sector, when will an increase in investment spending\ngenerate the largest increase in equilibrium national income?\na_ when households have a high level of autonomous consumption\nb_ when households have a high level of compulsory saving\nc_ when households have a high marginal propensity to consume\nd_ when households have a high marginal propensity to save", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe magnitude of the increase in equilibrium national income resulting from an increase in investment spending is determined by the Keynesian multiplier effect. In a simple closed economy with no government, the formula for the multiplier (k) is k = 1 / (1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nThe marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of any additional income that households choose to spend. A high MPC means that a large fraction of new income is re-spent in the economy. This initial spending becomes income for others, who in turn spend a large portion of it, and this process continues through successive rounds. This creates a large cumulative effect on national income. Mathematically, if the MPC is high (e.g., 0.9), the denominator (1 - MPC) is small (0.1), resulting in a large multiplier (k = 10). Therefore, a high MPC generates the largest increase in equilibrium national income from a given increase in investment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. when households have a high level of autonomous consumption**\n\nAutonomous consumption is the level of spending that is independent of the level of income. It determines the starting point or intercept of the aggregate expenditure curve. While a higher level of autonomous consumption leads to a higher initial level of equilibrium national income, it does not influence the size of the multiplier. The multiplier effect depends on the *change* in consumption resulting from a *change* in income, which is measured by the marginal propensity to consume (the slope of the aggregate expenditure curve), not the initial level of spending.\n\n**B. when households have a high level of compulsory saving**\n\nCompulsory saving refers to savings mandated, typically by a government, such as contributions to a national pension scheme. Firstly, this concept is inconsistent with the question's premise of an economy with \"no government sector.\" Secondly, and more fundamentally, the multiplier effect is determined by the *marginal* decision of how to use *additional* income. The level of compulsory saving affects the total amount saved but does not define the marginal propensity to consume or save, which is the crucial determinant of the multiplier's size.\n\n**D. when households have a high marginal propensity to save**\n\nThe marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the proportion of any additional income that households choose to save. It represents a leakage or withdrawal from the circular flow of income. The multiplier can also be expressed as k = 1 / MPS. This formula shows an inverse relationship between the MPS and the multiplier. A high MPS means that a large fraction of any new income is withdrawn from the economy and not passed on as spending. This dampens the multiplier effect. Consequently, a high MPS would lead to a *smaller*, not larger, increase in equilibrium national income."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_143.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_s23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "23 which combination of policies is most likely to increase output?\n[| tectpotiy | onetry pote |\n\na decrease budget deficit decrease interest rates\n\nb decrease budget deficit increase interest rates\n\ncc increase budget deficit decrease interest rates\n\nd increase budget deficit increase interest rates", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn increase in output, or economic growth, is typically achieved through expansionary macroeconomic policies. These policies aim to increase aggregate demand (AD), which is the total demand for goods and services in an economy (AD = C + I + G + (X-M)).\n\n*   **Fiscal Policy:** This involves the government's use of spending and taxation to influence the economy. An **expansionary fiscal policy** aims to increase aggregate demand. This can be achieved by increasing government spending (G) or decreasing taxes (T). Both actions lead to an **increase in the budget deficit** (the gap between government spending and tax revenue). A larger deficit stimulates the economy by either directly adding to aggregate demand (higher G) or by increasing disposable income for consumers and businesses, encouraging more consumption (C) and investment (I).\n\n*   **Monetary Policy:** This is managed by the central bank and involves controlling interest rates and the money supply. An **expansionary monetary policy** also aims to increase aggregate demand. The primary tool for this is to **decrease interest rates**. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms. This incentivises increased spending on durable goods (consumption, C) and new capital projects (investment, I).\n\nThe most potent combination for increasing output is to use both expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies simultaneously. Therefore, increasing the budget deficit (expansionary fiscal) and decreasing interest rates (expansionary monetary) work together to provide the strongest stimulus to aggregate demand and, consequently, national output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **A: decrease budget deficit; decrease interest rates:** This option combines a contractionary fiscal policy with an expansionary monetary policy. Decreasing the budget deficit (by cutting government spending or raising taxes) would reduce aggregate demand, while decreasing interest rates would increase it. The net effect on output is uncertain and depends on the relative magnitude of the two policies. It is not the combination *most likely* to increase output.\n\n*   **B: decrease budget deficit; increase interest rates:** This option combines a contractionary fiscal policy (decreasing the budget deficit) with a contractionary monetary policy (increasing interest rates). Both policies are designed to reduce aggregate demand to combat inflation. This combination is most likely to *decrease* output, not increase it.\n\n*   **D: increase budget deficit; increase interest rates:** This option combines an expansionary fiscal policy with a contractionary monetary policy. The government would be trying to stimulate the economy, while the central bank would be trying to slow it down. Such a policy mix is contradictory. Furthermore, the expansionary fiscal policy (increased government borrowing) could lead to \"crowding out,\" where it drives up interest rates, and the central bank's actions would reinforce this effect, potentially stifling private investment and offsetting the fiscal stimulus.

This has several key macroeconomic consequences:\n\n1.  **Inflation:** Oil is a critical input for many industries, including transportation, manufacturing, and energy generation. An increase in the price of oil raises the costs of production for a vast number of firms in the economy. To maintain their profit margins, firms pass these higher costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This leads to **cost-push inflation**, causing the general price level to **increase**.\n\n2.  **Trade Balance:** The trade balance is the value of a country's exports minus the value of its imports. As a net importer of oil, the country's expenditure on imported oil will rise significantly due to the higher price (assuming the demand for oil is price inelastic, which is generally the case in the short-term). This increase in the total value of imports, while the value of exports remains unchanged (ceteris paribus), will cause the trade balance to deteriorate, or **worsen**. This means an existing trade deficit will become larger, or a trade surplus will shrink or turn into a deficit.\n\n3.  **Unemployment:** The increase in production costs causes a leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. This shift leads to a lower level of national output (real GDP) at a higher price level. A reduction in national output means that firms are producing fewer goods and services. Consequently, their demand for labour will decrease, leading to lay-offs and a rise in cyclical **unemployment**. The simultaneous occurrence of rising inflation and rising unemployment is known as stagflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. A rise in the price of a key imported commodity like oil would cause cost-push inflation, meaning inflation would **increase**, not decrease. Furthermore, the higher cost of oil imports would cause the trade balance to **worsen**, not experience **no change**.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that inflation will increase, it incorrectly states that the trade balance will **improve** and unemployment will **decrease**. A higher import bill for oil will worsen the trade balance. The negative supply-side shock reduces economic output, which increases unemployment, it does not decrease it.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect on all three points.

These policies work by improving the quantity or quality of the factors of production and enhancing the efficiency of markets. An imposition of maximum hours in a working week is a form of labour market regulation that directly limits the quantity of labour input available. By restricting the number of hours employees can work, this policy constrains the potential output of firms and the economy as a whole. This runs counter to the objectives of supply-side policies, which often seek to increase labour market flexibility and the supply of labour. Therefore, such a regulation would reduce the effectiveness of any concurrent supply-side stimulus intended to boost economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. an increase in public sector spending**\n\nAn increase in public sector spending is a tool of expansionary fiscal policy, which is primarily a demand-side policy. It aims to boost aggregate demand (AD), not aggregate supply (AS). While this policy does not directly enhance supply-side measures, it does not necessarily reduce their effectiveness either. In fact, if supply-side policies successfully increase the economy's productive potential, an increase in aggregate demand can help to ensure that this new capacity is utilised, leading to non-inflationary growth. Therefore, it is not a factor that would reduce the effectiveness of a supply-side stimulus.\n\n**C. the provision of new training schemes**\n\nThe provision of new training schemes is a classic example of a supply-side policy. By improving the skills, knowledge, and productivity of the workforce, training schemes enhance the quality of human capital. This directly contributes to an increase in the economy's productive capacity and a rightward shift of the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. As such, this policy would complement and enhance the effectiveness of a broader supply-side stimulus, rather than reduce it.\n\n**D. the relaxation of import controls on raw materials**\n\nThe relaxation of import controls, such as tariffs or quotas, on raw materials is a type of supply-side policy focused on trade liberalisation and deregulation. By making imported raw materials cheaper and more accessible for domestic producers, this policy lowers their costs of production. Lower costs incentivise firms to increase their output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the right. This can also contribute to long-run growth by encouraging investment.

The MNC will need to hire local workers for various roles, from construction to production and administration. This injection of demand into the local labour market leads to an increase in employment levels.\n\n*   **Investment Increases:** The process of shifting manufacturing capacity involves significant capital expenditure within the host (developing) country. This includes the construction of factories, the purchase of machinery and equipment, and the development of related infrastructure. This constitutes an inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which is recorded as an increase in the overall investment level (a component of Aggregate Demand) in the developing country's economy.\n\n*   **Short-run Balance of Payments Current Account Does Not Improve:** The current account of the balance of payments records trade in goods and services, as well as income flows.

This increase in imports will cause a deterioration (worsening) of the current account balance.

It plots a measure of economic development, typically gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, on the horizontal axis against a measure of income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient, on the vertical axis. The curve suggests that as a country develops, income inequality first increases during the initial stages of industrialisation and urbanisation, as a small portion of the population benefits from new high-wage opportunities. However, as the economy matures, inequality is hypothesised to decrease due to factors like mass education, a growing middle class, and the development of social welfare systems. Therefore, the economic variable X, which indicates the changing income distribution, is the level of income inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: the exchange rate**\nThe exchange rate is the value of one nation's currency in relation to another. While exchange rates are a critical component of international economics and can be influenced by a country's overall economic health (related to GDP), they do not directly measure the internal distribution of income among a country's population. The Kuznets curve is focused on the domestic pattern of income distribution during development, not its external currency valuation.\n\n**C: the price level**\nThe price level refers to the average of current prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services produced in an economy. While changes in the price level (inflation or deflation) affect the real value of income, the Kuznets curve is concerned with the *relative* distribution of income among different segments of the population, not the absolute purchasing power of that income.\n\n**D: the rate of interest**\nThe rate of interest is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving. It is a key tool of monetary policy and influences investment and consumption decisions.

Total utility refers to the overall satisfaction derived from consuming a certain quantity of a good. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of that good.\n\nThe premise states that marginal utility is **positive** and **diminishing**.\n1.  **Positive Marginal Utility**: This means that each additional unit of the good consumed adds to the consumer's satisfaction. Consequently, as more units are consumed, the total satisfaction, or total utility, must increase.\n2.  **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: This principle (the law of diminishing marginal utility) states that the amount of extra satisfaction gained from each successive unit is less than the satisfaction gained from the previous unit.\n\nCombining these two concepts, we can conclude that while total satisfaction continues to rise with consumption (because marginal utility is positive), it does so more slowly with each additional unit (because marginal utility is diminishing). Therefore, total satisfaction rises at a decreasing rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Total satisfaction falls at a decreasing rate.**\nThis is incorrect because it states that total satisfaction falls. Total satisfaction would only fall if the marginal utility from consuming an additional unit was negative (i.e., the consumer experiences disutility). The premise explicitly states that marginal utility is positive, meaning total satisfaction must be rising.\n\n**B: Total satisfaction falls at an increasing rate.**\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option A. A fall in total satisfaction implies negative marginal utility, which contradicts the given premise.

This means that new firms can easily enter the market to compete with existing firms and can also leave without incurring substantial sunk costs. The *threat* of this potential entry forces incumbent firms to behave competitively, keeping prices low and earning only normal profits in the long run.\n\n-   **Perfect Competition:** This market structure is, by definition, perfectly contestable. One of its core assumptions is the complete freedom of entry and exit for firms, with no barriers whatsoever.\n-   **Monopolistic Competition:** This structure is also considered highly contestable. While there are some costs associated with product differentiation and advertising, the barriers to entry are very low. New firms can relatively easily enter with their own differentiated products, which ensures that any supernormal profits are competed away in the long run.\n-   **Pure Monopoly:** A pure monopoly is the antithesis of a contestable market. Its existence is predicated on the presence of high or absolute barriers to entry (e.g., patents, control of resources, significant economies of scale creating a natural monopoly). These barriers prevent new firms from entering the market to challenge the monopolist, meaning the market is not contestable.\n\nTherefore, both perfect competition and monopolistic competition are contestable, while a pure monopoly is not.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly identifies a pure monopoly as contestable and both perfect and monopolistic competition as non-contestable. A pure monopoly is defined by high barriers to entry, making it fundamentally non-contestable. Conversely, perfect and monopolistic competition are characterised by freedom of entry, which is the key condition for contestability.\n\n**B:** This option incorrectly states that a pure monopoly is contestable and that perfect competition is not. A pure monopoly is characterised by high barriers to entry, which shields it from potential competition, making it non-contestable. Perfect competition, with its assumption of zero barriers to entry and exit, is the textbook example of a contestable market.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly claims that monopolistic competition is not contestable. While firms in monopolistic competition engage in non-price competition (like branding), which can create some degree of brand loyalty, the overall barriers to entry remain low.

This is represented graphically by an upward-sloping LRAC curve. In the diagram, between output levels OL and OM, the LRAC curve is clearly downward sloping. A downward-sloping LRAC indicates that the firm is experiencing economies of scale (or increasing returns to scale), where long-run average costs are falling as output rises. Therefore, the statement that there are decreasing returns to scale is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. Average fixed costs are falling.**\nAverage fixed cost (AFC) is calculated by dividing total fixed cost (TFC) by the quantity of output (Q). In the short run, represented by a single SRAC curve, at least one factor of production is fixed, meaning TFC is a constant value. As output increases from OL to OM, this constant total fixed cost is spread over a larger number of units. Consequently, the average fixed cost per unit must decline. This principle, known as \"spreading the overhead,\" ensures that AFC is always falling as output increases.\n\n**B. Economies ofscale are being experienced.**\nEconomies of scale are a long-run concept referring to the cost advantages a firm experiences as it increases its scale of production. They are indicated by a downward-sloping long-run average cost (LRAC) curve. The diagram shows that between output levels OL and OM, the LRAC curve is falling. This means that as the firm increases its potential scale of production in this range, its average cost per unit decreases. Thus, the firm is experiencing economies of scale.\n\n**C. The law of diminishing returns is operative.**\nThe law of diminishing returns is a short-run concept. It states that as successive units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decline. This decline in marginal product leads to a rise in short-run marginal cost (SMC) and is the reason why short-run average cost (SRAC) curves are U-shaped. The entire shape of the SRAC1 curve is determined by this law. Even though SRAC1 is falling between OL and OM (due to falling AFC and perhaps initial increasing returns to the variable factor), the underlying principle of diminishing returns is what governs the short-run production possibilities and will eventually cause the SRAC curve to rise. Therefore, the law is considered operative."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_155.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "5 which combination of reactions by rivals results in a kinked demand curve for an oligopolist when\na price is changed?\na copying both a price rise and a price fall\nb_ copying a price rise and ignoring a price fall\nc_ ignoring a price rise and copying a price fall\nd_ ignoring both a price rise and a price fall", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe kinked demand curve model is used to explain price rigidity in an oligopolistic market. The model's central assumption is that firms in an oligopoly will react asymmetrically to a price change by a rival. Specifically:\n\n*   **Reaction to a Price Rise:** If one firm raises its price, it is assumed that rival firms will **ignore** the change and hold their prices constant. By doing so, they can attract customers from the firm that raised its price, thereby increasing their own market share. This means that for the firm that initiated the price rise, demand will be relatively elastic, as a small increase in price will lead to a large fall in quantity demanded.\n*   **Reaction to a Price Fall:** Conversely, if one firm lowers its price, it is assumed that rival firms will **copy** the price cut to avoid losing their market share. Because all firms lower their prices, the original firm does not gain a significant number of new customers from its rivals. Demand for the firm's product will therefore be relatively inelastic for a price decrease.\n\nThis combination of an elastic demand curve for a price rise and an inelastic demand curve for a price fall creates a 'kink' at the current market price, discouraging firms from changing their prices and leading to price stability.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. copying both a price rise and a price fall**\nIf rivals were to copy both price rises and price falls, the individual firm's demand curve would not have a kink. Instead, it would be relatively inelastic throughout. The firm would retain its market share regardless of the price change. This scenario is more descriptive of a collusive arrangement or price leadership model, not the kinked demand curve theory.\n\n**B. copying a price rise and ignoring a price fall**\nThis scenario describes the opposite assumptions of the kinked demand curve model. If rivals copy a price rise, the firm's demand would be inelastic for a price increase. If they ignore a price fall, demand would be elastic for a price decrease. This would create a 'reverse kink' and would strongly incentivise firms to cut prices, leading to price wars and instability, which is the opposite phenomenon the standard kinked demand curve model seeks to explain.\n\n**D. ignoring both a price rise and a price fall**\nIf rivals were to ignore all price changes, the oligopolist's demand curve would be a standard, smooth, downward-sloping curve. There would be no kink because the elasticity of demand would not change abruptly based on the direction of the price change. The firm would face a predictable response from consumers, but the strategic interdependence that defines the kinked demand curve model would be absent."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_156.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "6 whatis a key condition for effective price discrimination?\na_ the product cannot be resold to another consumer.\nb_ the product must be price inelastic.\nc_ the profits from one market can be used to subsidise another market.\nd_ there are low barriers to entry into the market.", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**A. The product cannot be resold to another consumer.**\n\nThis is a crucial condition for effective price discrimination. Price discrimination involves selling the same product to different groups of consumers at different prices. For this strategy to be profitable and sustainable, the firm must be able to prevent **arbitrage**. Arbitrage occurs when consumers who purchase the product at a lower price resell it to consumers in the higher-priced market segment.\n\nIf resale is possible, consumers in the low-price group would buy the product and sell it to the high-price group at a price below what the firm charges but above what they paid. This process would continue until the price difference between the two markets is eliminated, undermining the firm's entire price discrimination strategy. Therefore, preventing resale, either by the nature of the product (e.g., a service like a haircut or a flight ticket tied to a specific individual) or through contractual means, is essential.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. The product must be price inelastic.**\n\nThis statement is inaccurate. The key condition regarding elasticity is not that the overall demand for the product is inelastic, but that the firm can segment its market into groups with **different price elasticities of demand (PED)**. A firm practicing price discrimination will charge a higher price to the consumer group with a more price-inelastic demand and a lower price to the group with a more price-elastic demand. If all consumers had the same PED, there would be no basis for charging different prices.\n\n**C. The profits from one market can be used to subsidise another market.**\n\nThis describes cross-subsidisation, which can be a *result* or application of price discrimination, but it is not a *precondition* for it. The fundamental goal of price discrimination is to maximise total profit by capturing consumer surplus from different market segments. While it is possible that the profits from the high-price (inelastic) market could be used to cover costs or lower prices in the low-price (elastic) market, this is not a necessary condition for price discrimination to occur. A firm can successfully price discriminate between two or more profitable market segments without one needing to subsidise another.\n\n**D. There are low barriers to entry into the market.**\n\nThis is the opposite of the required condition. For a firm to practice price discrimination, it must possess a significant degree of **market power**, which allows it to act as a price maker. Market power is typically sustained by **high barriers to entry**, which restrict new firms from entering the market and competing away the supernormal profits. If barriers to entry were low, new competitors would be attracted by the profits earned through price discrimination, leading to increased competition that would drive prices down and erode the original firm's ability to maintain different prices."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_157.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "7 which combination of cost conditions is most likely to act as a barrier to entry to a new firm\nwanting to join an industry?\nfixed costs as minimum efficient\n: : ; level of\na proportion of scale of firms in sunk costs\ntotal costs the industry\n\na high high output high\nb high low output high\nc low high output low\nd low low output low", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThis combination of cost conditions creates the most significant barriers to entry for a new firm. Each element contributes to making entry difficult, expensive, and risky:\n*   **High fixed costs as a proportion of total costs:** This indicates a capital-intensive industry, requiring a large initial investment in assets like factories and machinery. This high start-up cost is a major financial hurdle for potential entrants.\n*   **High minimum efficient scale (MES) of firms:** This means a firm must achieve a large scale of production to reach the lowest possible average cost. A new entrant must either risk entering on a large scale, which requires substantial investment and capturing a large market share quickly, or enter on a smaller scale and suffer a cost disadvantage against established, more efficient firms.\n*   **High level of sunk costs:** Sunk costs are costs that cannot be recovered if a firm decides to leave the industry (e.g., spending on firm-specific advertising or specialised equipment). High sunk costs increase the risk of entry, as an unsuccessful entry results in a large, irreversible financial loss, thus deterring potential competitors.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nWhile high fixed costs and high sunk costs are significant barriers to entry, a low minimum efficient scale (MES) mitigates these barriers. A low MES means a new firm can achieve cost-competitiveness at a relatively small scale of production. This reduces the initial market share the firm needs to capture and lowers the overall risk, making entry easier than in the scenario described in option A.\n\n#### C\nThis combination presents relatively weak barriers to entry. Although a high minimum efficient scale (MES) can be a barrier, it is undermined by low fixed costs and low sunk costs. Low fixed costs mean the initial financial outlay to start the business is small. Low sunk costs mean the risk of failure is reduced, as the firm can exit the market without losing a substantial portion of its initial investment. Therefore, entry is significantly less difficult than in option A.\n\n#### D\nThis set of conditions represents the lowest possible barriers to entry, making it the easiest combination for a new firm to join an industry. Low fixed costs require minimal start-up capital. A low minimum efficient scale (MES) allows new firms to be competitive even at a small size. Low sunk costs mean there is little risk in entering, as most of the investment can be recovered upon exit.

It describes a firm adjusting its scale of production to reach the lowest possible point on its *existing* LRAC curve, thereby fully exploiting economies of scale.

It reflects optimisation within the current technological framework, whereas dynamic efficiency involves changing that framework.\n\n**C. a move from a point inside a production possibility curve to a point on it**\nThis illustrates an improvement in productive efficiency at a single point in time. A point inside the production possibility curve (PPC) signifies that resources are being used inefficiently (e.g., due to unemployment or misallocation). Moving to a point on the curve means the economy is now using its existing resources and technology fully and efficiently. This is a concept of static efficiency.

Government failure occurs when government intervention leads to a net loss of economic welfare and a less efficient allocation of resources. An increase in consumer surplus, which is the difference between the total amount consumers are willing to pay for a good and the amount they actually pay, is generally a positive economic outcome. For instance, a government intervention to regulate a monopoly by imposing a price ceiling below the monopoly price can lead to a lower price and higher output. This would increase consumer surplus and could move the market closer to the allocatively efficient outcome, representing a successful government intervention, not a failure.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** A government intervention leading to a less efficient allocation of resources is a core definition of government failure. Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are distributed in a way that maximizes net social benefit (where marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost). If government action, such as imposing a distorting tax or a poorly-set price control, moves the market further away from this efficient point, it constitutes a failure.\n\n**B:** A net loss of economic welfare is a defining characteristic of government failure. Economic welfare is the total benefit society receives from an economic activity, often measured by the sum of consumer and producer surplus. When government intervention causes this total surplus to decrease (creating or increasing deadweight loss), it means the intervention has made society worse off overall.\n\n**D:** Government intervention leading to social costs exceeding social benefits is a clear instance of government failure.

School leavers who were previously unsuitable due to a lack of skills now become a viable source of labour for the firm. This increase in the number of available and qualified workers at each wage level is represented by a rightward shift in the firm's labour supply curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A:** The firm is implementing the training scheme specifically to combat a shortage of labour. A shortage means the firm wishes to employ more workers than are currently available. The training scheme is designed to increase the number of suitable applicants, thereby allowing the firm to hire more workers.

The introduction of a new tax, whether it is regressive, progressive, or proportional, creates a new stream of income for the state. Assuming the tax is levied on a good, service, or income base that is actively part of the economy, it will collect funds from individuals and firms. Therefore, the most direct and certain outcome of introducing a new tax is an increase in total government tax revenues.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Aggregate demand will increase.**\nThis is incorrect. A tax reduces the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms. A regressive tax, in particular, takes a larger proportion of income from low-income earners. Low-income households tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC), meaning they spend a larger fraction of their income on goods and services. By reducing their disposable income, a regressive tax causes a significant reduction in overall consumption (C), a key component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + X-M). This leads to a decrease, not an increase, in aggregate demand.\n\n**B. Employment opportunities will increase.**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in employment is typically driven by economic growth, which requires a rise in aggregate demand. As explained above, the introduction of a new regressive tax is likely to reduce aggregate demand due to lower consumption. A fall in aggregate demand signals to firms that they should reduce their output. To cut production, firms will reduce their demand for factors of production, including labour. This results in fewer employment opportunities, or potentially an increase in unemployment, not an increase in jobs.\n\n**C. Income equality will improve.**\nThis is incorrect. A regressive tax is defined by its effect on income distribution: it takes a smaller percentage of income in tax as income rises. This means that lower-income individuals and households pay a larger proportion of their income in tax compared to higher-income individuals. Consequently, a regressive tax places a heavier burden on the poor, which widens the gap in disposable income between the rich and the poor. This leads to a worsening of income inequality, not an improvement in income equality."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_165.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "15 which government policy to counter the effects of income inequality is correctly matched with one\nof its advantages and one of its disadvantages?\n| potey aevantage of potey | tsacvantage of pote |\na food subsidies for the poor targets those in need high administrative costs\nb higher national minimum wage encourages skill training higher budget deficit\ncc provision of free child care increases employability disincentive to work\nd universal monetary benefits saves on bureaucracy reduced labour mobility", "Chapter": 25, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies both a key advantage and a key disadvantage of providing food subsidies to the poor.\n\n*   **Policy:** Food subsidies are a form of means-tested benefit, where assistance is given in-kind (food) or through vouchers to low-income households. This policy directly addresses one of the most severe consequences of income inequality: the inability to afford basic necessities.\n*   **Advantage:** \"Targets those in need\" is a primary advantage of means-tested policies. By establishing eligibility criteria based on income, the government can direct resources specifically to the poorest households, making the policy efficient in its goal of alleviating poverty and reducing the welfare gap.\n*   **Disadvantage:** \"High administrative costs\" is a significant drawback. To ensure that subsidies only go to eligible individuals and to prevent fraud, the government must establish a bureaucracy to assess applications, verify income levels, and manage the distribution of benefits. These administrative processes can be complex and expensive to operate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: Higher national minimum wage**\nThis option is incorrect because the disadvantage is wrongly matched. A higher national minimum wage is a price floor for labour, mandated for private employers. It does not directly involve government spending and therefore does not directly cause a higher budget deficit. The primary disadvantages associated with raising the minimum wage are the potential for increased unemployment (as firms' labour costs rise, they may reduce the quantity of labour demanded) and cost-push inflation.\n\n**C: Provision of free child care**\nThis option is incorrect because the stated advantage and disadvantage are contradictory. While the advantage, \"increases employability,\" is correct (as it removes a significant cost barrier for parents entering the workforce), the disadvantage, \"disincentive to work,\" is incorrect. The provision of free child care acts as a work-enabling benefit, making it easier for parents to work. It is an *incentive* to supply labour, not a disincentive. A common disadvantage of this policy is its high cost to the government, which must be funded through taxation.\n\n**D: Universal monetary benefits**\nThis option is incorrect because the disadvantage is not a recognised consequence of this policy. While the advantage, \"saves on bureaucracy,\" is a key argument in favour of universal benefits (like a Universal Basic Income), the disadvantage, \"reduced labour mobility,\" is not a typical outcome. Labour mobility is the ease with which workers can change jobs or locations. A universal benefit, being non-conditional and portable, would likely have no negative effect on mobility and might even increase it by providing a financial cushion for workers to seek better opportunities elsewhere.

This occurs under the conditions of a positive externality and elastic demand.\n\n1.  **Type of Externality:** Externalities represent the divergence between private and social costs or benefits.\n    *   A **positive externality** in production or consumption means the social benefit of the good is greater than the private benefit (or the social cost is less than the private cost). The free market, left to its own devices, will under-produce and under-consume this good relative to the socially optimal level. A subsidy lowers the private cost of production, encouraging producers to increase output, thus helping to correct the under-production and move the quantity towards the social optimum.\n    *   A **negative externality** means the good is over-produced. A subsidy would worsen this market failure by encouraging even more production. Therefore, for a subsidy to be beneficial, the externality must be positive.\n\n2.  **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** PED measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. The primary goal of a subsidy in this context is to increase the quantity of the good consumed.\n    *   If demand is **price elastic (PED > 1)**, a decrease in price (resulting from the subsidy) will lead to a proportionally larger increase in the quantity demanded. This means the subsidy is very effective at increasing output and consumption, successfully closing the gap between the market and socially optimal quantities.\n    *   If demand is **price inelastic (PED < 1)**, a decrease in price will lead to a proportionally smaller increase in quantity demanded. The subsidy would be less effective in achieving its goal of significantly raising consumption levels.\n\nTherefore, a subsidy is most beneficial when it is applied to a good that generates positive externalities and for which demand is price elastic, as this combination ensures the policy is both appropriately directed at an under-provision problem and highly effective in stimulating the required increase in quantity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A: negative externality, PED < 1**\n    A subsidy is the incorrect policy for a negative externality. A negative externality implies over-production of a good (e.g., pollution from a factory). A subsidy would lower production costs and encourage even more production, exacerbating the market failure and increasing the welfare loss to society. The appropriate policy would be a tax to discourage production.\n\n*   **B: negative externality, PED > 1**\n    Similar to option A, applying a subsidy to a good with a negative externality is counterproductive. It would worsen the over-production problem, moving the market further away from the socially optimal output level. The elasticity of demand is irrelevant when the fundamental policy tool is incorrect for the type of market failure.\n\n*   **C: positive externality, PED < 1**\n    While a subsidy is the correct policy for a positive externality, its benefit is limited when demand is price inelastic (PED < 1). With inelastic demand, consumers are not very responsive to price changes. The subsidy would lower the price, but the resulting increase in quantity consumed would be small. A significant portion of the subsidy would benefit existing consumers through a lower price, rather than stimulating the new consumption needed to reach the socially optimal level.

The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in spending leads to a larger final change in national income. Its value is determined by the formula `k = 1 / MPW`, where MPW is the marginal propensity to withdraw.\n\nIn a closed economy with a government, withdrawals (or leakages) from the circular flow of income consist of savings and taxes. Therefore, the MPW is the sum of the marginal propensity to save (MPS) and the marginal propensity to tax (MPT). The multiplier is `k = 1 / (MPS + MPT)`.\n\nWhen the economy allows international trade, a new leakage is introduced: spending on imports (M). This means that a portion of any new income will be spent on foreign goods and services, leaking out of the domestic economy. The marginal propensity to import (MPM) is added to the withdrawals. The new MPW becomes `MPS + MPT + MPM`.\n\nSince the marginal propensity to import (MPM) is a positive value, the denominator of the multiplier formula (`MPS + MPT + MPM`) increases. An increase in the denominator of a fraction leads to a decrease in the overall value of that fraction. Consequently, the value of the economy's multiplier decreases.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A) components of aggregate expenditure**\n\nThis would increase, not decrease. In a closed economy with a government, aggregate expenditure (AE) is calculated as `AE = C + I + G`, where C is consumption, I is investment, and G is government spending. When the economy opens to international trade, the formula for aggregate expenditure expands to include net exports (X-M). The new formula is `AE = C + I + G + (X - M)`. This adds a new component, thus increasing the number of components of aggregate expenditure.\n\n**B) number of injections into the circular flow of income**\n\nThis would increase, not decrease. In a closed economy with a government sector, the injections into the circular flow of income are investment (I) and government spending (G). When international trade is introduced, exports (X) become an additional injection, as money flows into the economy from abroad in payment for domestically produced goods and services. This increases the total number of injections from two to three.\n\n**C) number of leakages from the circular flow of income**\n\nThis would increase, not decrease. In a closed economy with a government sector, the leakages (or withdrawals) from the circular flow of income are savings (S) and taxation (T). When the economy opens to international trade, imports (M) are introduced as a new leakage, representing money that flows out of the domestic economy to pay for foreign goods and services.

It is defined as the amount by which aggregate demand (AD) falls short of the level required to generate full employment.\n\nOn the Keynesian cross diagram, the 45\u00b0 line represents all points where aggregate expenditure equals national income (Y = AE). The full employment level of income is given as Y_F. To achieve full employment, aggregate expenditure must be equal to Y_F. This is represented by point J on the 45\u00b0 line.\n\nHowever, at the income level Y_F, the actual aggregate demand in the economy is shown by the AD curve at point K. The vertical distance between point J (the required spending for full employment) and point K (the actual spending at full employment income) represents the shortfall in aggregate demand. This shortfall, measured by the distance JK, is the deflationary gap.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. JL:** The distance JL is the vertical gap between the 45\u00b0 line (point J) and the consumption function (point L) at the full employment income level Y_F. Since aggregate demand in a closed economy is AD = C + I + G (Consumption + Investment + Government Spending), the distance JL represents the amount of spending needed on top of consumption (i.e., I + G) to reach the full employment equilibrium. It does not represent the shortfall of total aggregate demand, which is the definition of the deflationary gap.\n\n**C. NY_F:** This represents a horizontal distance along the income axis. A deflationary gap is a measure of the shortfall in aggregate expenditure, which is measured on the vertical axis. A horizontal distance measures a difference in income levels. Furthermore, the point N is not the equilibrium level of income, making the distance NY_F economically meaningless in the context of identifying the deflationary or output gap.\n\n**D.

This type of policy involves the government directly mandating a specific level of performance or behaviour. In this case, the government sets a legal limit on the quantity of pollutants a firm can emit. All firms are required to comply with this standard, regardless of their individual costs of abatement. This approach does not use market forces or price signals to achieve its goal; it is a direct legal requirement with penalties for non-compliance.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The introduction of carbon taxes on pollution:**\nThis is a **market-based policy**. A carbon tax works by increasing the private cost of polluting, thereby internalising the negative externality. It places a price on each unit of carbon emitted, creating a financial incentive for firms to reduce their emissions. Firms are free to decide how they will respond: they can pay the tax, invest in cleaner technology, or reduce production. The market mechanism (the price signal from the tax) encourages the reduction of pollution in the most cost-effective manner, making this an incentive-based, not a regulatory, approach.\n\n**B. The operation of tradable pollution permits:**\nThis is a **market-based policy**, commonly known as a \"cap-and-trade\" system. The government first sets a total cap on emissions (a regulatory element) but then creates a market for permits that allow firms to pollute up to that cap. Firms that can reduce their pollution at a low cost can sell their unused permits to firms for whom abatement is more expensive. This creates a market price for the right to pollute and ensures that the overall reduction in pollution is achieved at the lowest possible cost to society. The use of a tradable asset (the permit) and a market to allocate it firmly places this policy in the market-based category.\n\n**C. The provision of government subsidies:**\nThis is a **market-based policy**. Subsidies are financial incentives provided by the government to encourage a particular behaviour. In the context of climate change, a government might subsidise the development of renewable energy, the adoption of green technology, or research into carbon capture. By lowering the cost of these activities, the subsidy uses the price mechanism to steer producers and consumers towards more environmentally friendly choices.

This requires balancing economic objectives with environmental and social considerations.\n\nThis policy addresses sustainability through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, levying taxes on harmful goods (a form of Pigouvian tax) aims to correct market failure. These goods often generate negative externalities, such as pollution, where the social cost of production or consumption exceeds the private cost. The tax internalises this external cost, increasing the price for consumers and discouraging consumption, which in turn reduces the associated environmental damage. Secondly, using the tax revenue to fund environmental education promotes a long-term shift in societal attitudes and behaviours. An educated population is more likely to demand and adopt sustainable practices, support green policies, and innovate in ways that conserve resources. This combination of discouraging harmful activities in the short run and fostering a culture of sustainability for the long run is most aligned with achieving sustainable economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: deregulation of industrial production that uses mineral resources and fossil fuel**\nThis policy is likely to be counterproductive to sustainability. While deregulation might lower production costs and stimulate short-term economic growth, it would do so by weakening environmental protections. This would accelerate the depletion of non-renewable resources (mineral resources and fossil fuels) and increase pollution, causing long-term environmental damage. Such growth is unsustainable as it degrades the natural capital upon which future generations depend.\n\n**C: increased trade barriers on imports to protect domestic jobs and incomes**\nThis is a protectionist policy. While it may offer short-term protection to specific domestic industries, it generally leads to a misallocation of resources and economic inefficiency by shielding firms from international competition. This can result in higher prices for consumers and potential retaliatory measures from trade partners. Critically, this policy has no direct mechanism to ensure environmental sustainability and could even be detrimental if it protects inefficient, polluting domestic industries.\n\n**D: reduced planning regulations to encourage construction in areas of natural beauty**\nThis policy directly contradicts the principles of sustainable development. Areas of natural beauty are a form of environmental capital, providing valuable ecosystem services and aesthetic value. Reducing planning regulations to allow construction in these areas would lead to the irreversible destruction of this capital. While it might generate short-term economic activity in the construction sector, it sacrifices long-term environmental well-being for immediate gain, which is the antithesis of sustainability."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_171.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "21 in all major towns in a country, a government adopts a policy of opening centres where job\nvacancies are advertised.\nwhich type of unemployment is the government aiming to reduce with this policy?\na cyclical\nb frictional\nc regional\nd_ seasonal", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B) frictional**\n\nFrictional unemployment is the temporary unemployment that occurs when individuals are in the process of moving from one job to another, or are entering the workforce for the first time. It is a natural and unavoidable part of a dynamic economy. The core cause of frictional unemployment is imperfect information in the labour market; it takes time for job seekers to find suitable vacancies and for employers to find suitable candidates.\n\nThe government policy of opening centres to advertise job vacancies directly addresses this information failure. By providing a centralized source of information about available jobs, these centres make it easier and faster for unemployed individuals to find work that matches their skills. This reduces the \"search time\" for both workers and firms, thereby shortening the period people spend between jobs and reducing the level of frictional unemployment.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A) cyclical**\n\nCyclical (or demand-deficient) unemployment is caused by a downturn in the business cycle, such as a recession. It arises from a general lack of aggregate demand in the economy, leading firms to reduce production and lay off workers. The problem is not a lack of information about jobs, but a lack of jobs themselves. Opening job centres to advertise vacancies does not create new jobs or stimulate aggregate demand. Therefore, this policy would be ineffective at reducing cyclical unemployment, which requires macroeconomic policies like expansionary fiscal or monetary policy.\n\n**C) regional**\n\nRegional unemployment is a type of structural unemployment where joblessness is concentrated in particular geographical areas, often due to the decline of a major local industry. It is caused by a geographical mismatch between the location of jobs and the location of the unemployed, often compounded by the occupational or geographical immobility of labour. While job centres might help individuals find work within their region, the policy described is a nationwide initiative (\"in all major towns\"). It does not specifically target the underlying causes of regional unemployment, such as by providing incentives for firms to move to depressed areas or offering relocation grants to workers.\n\n**D) seasonal**\n\nSeasonal unemployment occurs when demand for labour changes according to the time of year. Industries such as tourism, agriculture, and construction often have peak and off-peak seasons, leading to predictable fluctuations in employment. The issue is a temporary lack of demand for certain types of labour, not a lack of information about job availability. Job centres cannot create demand for ski instructors in the summer or for fruit pickers in the winter. This policy, therefore, does not address the fundamental cause of seasonal unemployment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_172.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "22 what is the basic assumption underlying the accelerator theory?\na_ investment depends on the level of business confidence.\nb_ investment depends on the level of savings.\nc_ investment depends on the rate of change in national income.\nd_ investment depends on the rate of change of interest rates.", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe accelerator theory of investment establishes a direct relationship between the level of net investment and the **rate of change** of national income (GDP). The core assumption is that firms seek to maintain a desired or optimal ratio of their capital stock to their level of output (the capital-output ratio).\n\nWhen national income grows, aggregate demand increases. To meet this rising demand, firms need to expand their productive capacity by investing in new capital goods (e.g., machinery, factories). The level of this *induced investment* is determined not by the absolute level of national income, but by how quickly it is growing. A rapid increase in national income will necessitate a large amount of new investment, while a slower rate of growth (or a decline) will lead to a fall in net investment. This relationship explains why investment spending tends to be more volatile than the business cycle itself.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A. Investment depends on the level of business confidence.** While business confidence, or what Keynes termed \"animal spirits,\" is a crucial determinant of investment, it is not the foundational assumption of the accelerator theory. The accelerator provides a more mechanistic explanation of investment, focusing on how changes in output automatically induce investment. Keynesian investment theory, in contrast, places greater emphasis on expectations and psychological factors like confidence.\n\n*   **B. Investment depends on the level of savings.** In macroeconomics, savings are essential for financing investment (as per the savings-investment identity, I=S). Savings represent the supply of loanable funds. However, the accelerator theory is concerned with explaining the determinants of the *demand* for investment from firms. It posits that the primary driver for this demand is the need to expand capacity in response to growing national income, rather than the availability of savings.\n\n*   **D. Investment depends on the rate of change of interest rates.** The level of interest rates is a key determinant of investment, as it represents the cost of borrowing funds to finance capital expenditure. A lower interest rate generally encourages more investment. However, the accelerator theory's specific focus is on the impact of changing income and output. The simple accelerator model often assumes the interest rate is constant to isolate the effect of changes in national income. Therefore, the rate of change of interest rates is not the basic assumption of this particular theory."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_173.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "23 what shows the correct outcome for the policy option?\na | depreciation of the exchange rate | encourages more exports, which also\nmeans greater employment\nb higher interest rates attracts hot money inflows, and is an\nincentive for more consumer spending\ncc decreased government spending more workers will be employed, and\nmore imports will be bought\nd reduction in income taxes increases consumer spending, with\nincreased demand for exports", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA depreciation of the exchange rate means the value of the domestic currency has fallen relative to foreign currencies. This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers when priced in their own currency, and makes imports more expensive for domestic buyers. The fall in the price of exports leads to an increase in the quantity demanded for them, thus encouraging more exports (assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition is met). This rise in net exports (X-M) represents an injection into the circular flow of income, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. To meet this higher demand, domestic firms will increase their output, which in turn requires hiring more workers, leading to greater employment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. higher interest rates**\nThis option is incorrect because while higher interest rates do attract 'hot money' inflows (short-term speculative capital seeking higher returns), they simultaneously act as a disincentive for consumer spending. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for consumers (for loans and mortgages) and increase the reward for saving. Both effects lead to a reduction, not an increase, in consumer spending, which is a key component of aggregate demand. Therefore, the outcome described is contradictory.\n\n**C. decreased government spending**\nThis option is incorrect. Decreased government spending is a form of contractionary fiscal policy. It directly reduces a component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + X-M). A fall in aggregate demand leads to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity and real output. Consequently, firms will reduce their production and require fewer workers, leading to a *decrease* in employment. Furthermore, lower national income resulting from the contractionary policy will reduce the demand for all goods and services, including imports. Thus, fewer imports would be bought, not more.\n\n**D. reduction in income taxes**\nThis option is incorrect because a reduction in domestic income taxes does not directly cause an increase in the demand for exports. A reduction in income taxes increases the disposable income of domestic consumers, which leads to an increase in consumer spending on both domestic goods and imports. However, the demand for a country's exports is determined by factors in foreign countries, such as their income levels, tastes and preferences, and the exchange rate. A domestic tax cut does not increase foreign incomes or change their preferences for the country's goods. Therefore, while consumer spending increases, the demand for exports is not directly affected in the manner described."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_174.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "24 the laffer curve shows expected tax revenues at different tax rates.\nr; een eee\nan )\nrevenue \\\n0 50 60\ntax rate/%\n\nan increase in the tax rate above 50% is expected to decrease tax revenue.\nwhat is the reason for this?\na decreased incentive for emigration\nb_ decreased incentive for tax evasion\nc increased incentive for people to work\nd increased incentive for people to work fewer hours", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe Laffer curve illustrates the theoretical relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. The downward-sloping portion of the curve, which occurs after the revenue-maximising rate (shown as 50% in the diagram), suggests that further increases in the tax rate will lead to a fall in total tax revenue.\n\nThis phenomenon is primarily explained by the disincentive effects of very high tax rates on economic activity. Specifically, as the tax rate on income rises, the net, after-tax wage rate that an individual receives for an additional hour of work falls. This reduces the opportunity cost of leisure (the income forgone by not working). Consequently, leisure becomes relatively more attractive compared to work. This is known as the substitution effect. Individuals may respond by choosing to work fewer hours, taking longer holidays, opting for early retirement, or being less willing to undertake overtime or seek promotions. This reduction in the supply of labour shrinks the overall tax base (the total income on which tax is levied). When the tax rate is sufficiently high, this negative impact on the tax base becomes so significant that it outweighs the positive effect of the higher rate, causing total tax revenue to decline.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. decreased incentive for emigration**\nThis is incorrect. A significant increase in the tax rate would likely make a country less financially attractive for high-income earners and mobile businesses. This would *increase*, not decrease, the incentive for them to emigrate to jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This emigration would shrink the tax base and contribute to a fall in tax revenue, but the option incorrectly identifies the incentive as decreasing.\n\n**B. decreased incentive for tax evasion**\nThis is incorrect. A higher tax rate increases the potential financial gain from illegally hiding income from the tax authorities. Therefore, a higher tax rate provides an *increased* incentive for tax evasion, as well as for legal tax avoidance (rearranging financial affairs to minimise tax liability). While increased evasion does lead to lower tax revenue, this option incorrectly states that the incentive for it decreases.\n\n**C. increased incentive for people to work**\nThis is incorrect. A higher tax rate reduces the portion of their gross earnings that individuals get to keep. This diminishes the financial reward for working. As a result, the incentive for people to supply their labour\u2014to work more hours or to enter the workforce\u2014is *decreased*, not increased. This disincentive effect is a key reason why tax revenues fall at very high tax rates."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_175.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "25 a government wishes to improve the income distribution between the richest and poorest in\nsociety. it introduces means tested benefits for workers on low incomes. to pay for this, income\ntax rates for the highest paid will increase.\n\nwhat is the most significant strength and weakness of this policy approach?\nstrength weakness\na benefits are only given poor non-workers\nto those in need will be no better off\nb intergenerational tax avoidance\nequity is improved is more likely\nc workers will be encouraged to taxation has become\nwork more hours more regressive\nd the policy approach will be wealth distribution will be affected\nefficient to operate more than income distribution", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Strength:** The policy introduces **means-tested benefits**, which are payments made only to individuals or households who can demonstrate that their income and/or wealth are below a specified level. A key strength of this approach is that it targets government assistance specifically to those identified as being in financial need. This prevents resources from being spent on those who are not poor, making the policy more efficient at alleviating poverty for the target group compared to universal, non-targeted benefits.\n\n**Weakness:** The policy specifies that the benefits are for **\"workers on low incomes\"**. This deliberately excludes individuals who are poor but not in employment. This group can include the unemployed, people with long-term illnesses or disabilities preventing them from working, and some retirees. As the government's stated goal is to improve income distribution between the richest and *poorest in society*, a policy that excludes a significant segment of the very poor represents a major weakness and limits the policy's overall effectiveness in achieving its goal.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **B:** The weakness described, that higher taxes on the rich may lead to increased **tax avoidance**, is a valid concern. However, the strength, that **intergenerational equity is improved**, is a less direct and certain outcome. While helping low-income families might have positive long-term effects on their children's opportunities, it is not the most direct or significant strength of the policy. The targeting of benefits to the needy (as in option A) is a more immediate and central feature.\n\n*   **C:** Both statements in this option are incorrect.\n    *   **Strength:** Means-tested benefits often create a **'poverty trap'**. As a low-income worker earns more, their benefits are gradually withdrawn. This withdrawal acts as a high effective marginal tax rate, which can **discourage**, not encourage, them from working more hours, as the net financial gain is minimal.\n    *   **Weakness:** The policy makes the fiscal system **more progressive**, not regressive. A progressive system is one where the proportion of income paid in tax rises as income rises. By increasing tax rates for the highest paid and providing benefits to the low-paid, the government is increasing the degree of income redistribution from rich to poor.\n\n*   **D:** Both statements in this option are questionable or incorrect.\n    *   **Strength:** Means-testing is often administratively complex and costly to operate. It requires a system to assess eligibility, verify incomes, and prevent fraud, which can make it **inefficient to operate** compared to simpler universal benefits.\n    *   **Weakness:** The policy is a direct intervention in **income distribution**, involving taxing income and providing income support. While changes in income can affect an individual's ability to accumulate wealth over the long term, the primary and immediate impact of this policy is on the distribution of income, not wealth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_176.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "26 a shows data on the unemployment and inflation rates for four countries in 2010 and\ncountry (% of workforce) (% per annum)\ncoy fesr | a\n\naustralia 5.2 6.1 2.7 1.6\ncanada 8.0 6.9 2.2 1.9\njapan 5.1 3.6 0.3 25\nunited states 9.6 6.2 1.7 0.6\n\nwhich countries had a typical phillips curve?\n\na australia and japan\n\nb_ australia only\n\nc japan only\n\nd canada and the united states", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA typical short-run Phillips curve illustrates an inverse relationship, or trade-off, between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment.

It adjusts GDP by accounting for factors that contribute to or detract from welfare but are not captured in traditional national income accounting. The MEW calculation involves adding the value of certain non-market activities and subtracting specific costs.\n\n1.  **Environmental Costs and Benefits:** GDP often increases with activities that harm the environment (e.g., production that pollutes). MEW subtracts the estimated costs of environmental degradation, such as pollution and resource depletion, to reflect the negative impact on welfare.\n2.  **The Value of Leisure Activity:** GDP does not account for the value of leisure. If people work fewer hours to enjoy more leisure time while maintaining the same level of output, their welfare has likely increased, but GDP would remain unchanged. MEW adds an imputed value for leisure time to capture this aspect of well-being.\n3.  **The Value of Unpaid Work:** A significant amount of productive activity, such as household chores, childcare, and volunteering, contributes directly to welfare but is not exchanged in the market and is therefore excluded from GDP.

A central criticism of GDP is its failure to account for the value of leisure and the negative externalities of environmental damage. The MEW was specifically developed to correct for these omissions. By including only unpaid work, this option represents an incomplete adjustment and does not accurately describe the calculation of MEW.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because, while it correctly includes adjustments for environmental costs, it omits the value of leisure and unpaid work. Both leisure time and non-market household production are significant contributors to an individual's standard of living and overall well-being. Excluding them would mean failing to capture a substantial portion of economic welfare that GDP ignores, which is contrary to the purpose of MEW.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it excludes the value of unpaid work. Non-market activities, such as household management and childcare, generate substantial value and are fundamental to societal well-being. A key innovation of the MEW framework is to estimate and add the value of this unpaid labour to provide a more comprehensive picture of economic welfare than GDP.

It is based on the \"law of one price,\" which posits that, in the absence of transaction costs and trade barriers, a standard basket of goods and services should cost the same in any two countries when prices are expressed in a common currency.

Indifference curves cannot intersect. If they were to cross, it would violate the axiom of transitivity and the assumption of non-satiation (that more of a good is always preferred).\n\nTo illustrate, assume two indifference curves, IC\u2081 and IC\u2082, intersect at point A. Let point B be another point on IC\u2081, and point C be another point on IC\u2082. According to the definition of an indifference curve, the consumer is indifferent between bundles A and B (A ~ B). Similarly, the consumer is indifferent between bundles A and C (A ~ C). The axiom of transitivity states that if A ~ B and A ~ C, then B ~ C.\n\nHowever, since points B and C lie on different indifference curves, they must represent different levels of satisfaction. Furthermore, it is possible to choose points B and C such that bundle C contains more of at least one good than bundle B (and no less of the other). The assumption of non-satiation dictates that the consumer would prefer bundle C to bundle B. This creates a logical contradiction: the consumer cannot both be indifferent between B and C and prefer C to B. Therefore, indifference curves can never cross.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. The range of indifference curves shows the combination of products a consumer can purchase with a given income.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes a **budget line** (or budget constraint), not an indifference curve. A budget line illustrates all possible combinations of two goods that a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of the goods. In contrast, a set of indifference curves (an indifference map) represents a consumer's preferences and shows which combinations provide equal or different levels of satisfaction, irrespective of income or prices. The optimal consumption choice is found where the highest possible indifference curve is tangent to the budget line, but the curves themselves do not represent affordability.\n\n**B. If an indifference curve is a downward-sloping straight line, the principle of diminishing marginal utility must be operating.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A downward-sloping straight-line indifference curve indicates that the two goods are **perfect substitutes**. This means the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) is constant. The consumer is always willing to trade one good for the other at a fixed rate, regardless of the quantities consumed. The principle of diminishing marginal utility, however, leads to a *diminishing* MRS. As a consumer has more of good X and less of good Y, they are willing to give up less and less of Y to obtain an additional unit of X. This diminishing MRS is what gives standard indifference curves their characteristic shape of being convex to the origin (bowed inwards), not a straight line.\n\n**D. The gap between indifference curves is always constant.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Indifference curves represent **ordinal utility**, not cardinal utility. Ordinal utility allows us to rank bundles of goods (e.g., any bundle on a higher indifference curve is preferred to any bundle on a lower one), but it does not measure the specific amount or magnitude of satisfaction. Consequently, the distance between indifference curves on a diagram has no economic meaning. We cannot say that the increase in utility from indifference curve 1 to 2 is the same as the increase from 2 to 3, even if they are drawn equidistant. The spacing is arbitrary and only serves to show the order of preference."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_183.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "3 negative externalities, such as air pollution due to car emissions, can cause damage to people\u2019s\nhealth in cities.\nwhich response is most likely to occur from this situation?\nacar manufacturers will automatically bear any external costs\nb- market failure will be resolved when private costs equal external costs\nc_ most people will decide to use buses rather than cars\nd some form of government intervention to improve economic efficiency", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nNegative externalities, such as pollution, represent a form of market failure. In a free market, the price of using a car reflects the private costs to the driver (fuel, maintenance, time) but does not include the external costs imposed on society (health issues from pollution, environmental damage). This leads to a divergence between the marginal private cost (MPC) and the marginal social cost (MSC), where MSC = MPC + Marginal External Cost. As a result, the market equilibrium quantity of car usage is higher than the socially optimal quantity, leading to an over-allocation of resources to car transport and a net welfare loss. To correct this market failure and improve economic efficiency by moving the market outcome closer to the social optimum, government intervention is typically required. This can take various forms, such as imposing taxes on fuel or emissions (Pigouvian taxes), implementing regulations (e.g., emission standards, low-emission zones), or subsidising alternatives like public transport.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. car manufacturers will automatically bear any external costs**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the defining characteristic of an externality is that its costs (or benefits) are *not* reflected in the market price and are borne by third parties, not the producers or consumers involved in the transaction. Car manufacturers, operating in their own self-interest, have no incentive to voluntarily or \"automatically\" internalise these external costs. Doing so would raise their production costs, making them less competitive. Action is typically required from an external body, such as the government, to force manufacturers or consumers to account for these costs.\n\n**B. market failure will be resolved when private costs equal external costs**\n\nThis statement misrepresents the condition for resolving market failure. Economic efficiency, or the social optimum, is achieved when the marginal social benefit (MSB) equals the marginal social cost (MSC). In the case of a negative externality, the market failure is resolved by ensuring that the decision-maker's private cost is aligned with the social cost. This means the consumer or producer must be made to pay a price that reflects both the private cost and the external cost (Price = MSC). The condition that \"private costs equal external costs\" has no theoretical basis for correcting the externality and would not lead to an efficient outcome.\n\n**C. most people will decide to use buses rather than cars**\n\nWhile a shift to public transport like buses is a potential *outcome* of policies designed to address the negative externality of car pollution, it is not a direct response that will occur on its own. Individual consumers will continue to make choices based on their private costs and benefits. Without a change in the relative costs\u2014for instance, through a tax on driving or a subsidy for buses\u2014there is no economic reason to expect a spontaneous, large-scale shift in behaviour.

The market has changed from an oligopoly to a monopoly.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the transformation of the market structure.\n\n1.  **Initial Market Structure (Oligopoly):** The market was initially characterized by the presence of \"two large firms\". A market structure dominated by a small number of large, interdependent firms is known as an oligopoly. In this case, it was a specific type of oligopoly called a duopoly.\n\n2.  **Resulting Market Structure (Effective Monopoly):** Following the merger, a single firm now controls 80% of the market. A pure monopoly exists when a single firm constitutes the entire market (100% market share). However, in economic terms, a firm with such a high degree of market concentration (well over 50%) is considered to have significant monopoly power. It can act as a price-maker and dominate the market with little regard for the competitive pressure from the much smaller \"fringe\" firms (the thousands of independent drivers who make up the remaining 20%). Therefore, the market has effectively become a monopoly, as the competitive dynamics are now dictated by one dominant player rather than the strategic interactions of a few.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The market has become monopolistically competitive.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A monopolistically competitive market consists of a large number of firms, each with a small market share and limited market power. While there are \"thousands of independent taxi drivers,\" the defining feature of the new market is the single firm with an 80% share.

This occurs at the profit-maximising level of output, where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). At this output (Q), the average revenue (AR) is equal to the average cost (AC). The diagram shows the AR curve is tangent to the AC curve at the profit-maximising output Q, indicating that the price (P) is exactly equal to the average cost. When total revenue (P x Q) equals total cost (AC x Q), the firm is covering all its explicit and implicit costs, which is the definition of normal profit. This long-run position is a result of the freedom of entry and exit in the market; any short-run abnormal profits would attract new firms, shifting the demand curve for existing firms to the left until only normal profits are made.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: It is allocatively efficient.**\nAllocative efficiency is achieved when resources are distributed in a way that maximises societal welfare. This occurs at the output level where the price (P) consumers are willing to pay is equal to the marginal cost (MC) of production. In the diagram, the firm produces at quantity Q, where MC = MR. At this quantity, the price P (determined by the AR curve) is clearly higher than the marginal cost (determined by the MC curve). Because P > MC, the value society places on the last unit produced is greater than the cost of the resources used to produce it, indicating an under-allocation of resources and thus, allocative inefficiency.\n\n**B: It is making abnormal losses.**\nAbnormal losses occur when a firm's average cost (AC) is greater than its average revenue (AR) at the profit-maximising level of output. This would mean the firm is not covering all its costs. The diagram shows that at the profit-maximising output Q, the average revenue (P) is exactly equal to the average cost, as the AR curve is tangent to the AC curve at this point. Therefore, the firm is not making abnormal losses.\n\n**C: It is making abnormal profits.**\nAbnormal profits (or supernormal profits) are earned when a firm's average revenue (AR) is greater than its average cost (AC) at the profit-maximising output. While a monopolistically competitive firm can earn abnormal profits in the short run, the freedom of entry in this market structure means new firms will be attracted by these profits. The entry of new firms increases competition and reduces the demand for the existing firm's product, shifting its AR curve to the left until it is tangent to the AC curve.

At this point, the revenue gained from producing one additional unit is exactly equal to the cost of producing it. If the firm chooses to produce beyond this point, up to where MR = 0, it means that for every additional unit produced after the MR=MC point, the marginal cost of that unit is greater than the marginal revenue it generates (since MC is always positive, and MR is falling towards zero). This will lead to a reduction in the firm's total profit. Therefore, a firm changing its aim from profit maximisation (MR=MC) to revenue maximisation (MR=0) is explicitly choosing to sacrifice some profit for another objective. The desire to gain more profits is not a correct explanation for this change in strategy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) The firm wishes to increase sales.**\nThis is a plausible reason for the change. The point where marginal revenue (MR) is zero corresponds to the point where total revenue is maximised. Therefore, a firm that changes its objective from maximising profit (producing at MR=MC) to producing where MR=0 is aiming to maximise its sales revenue. This strategy might be pursued to gain market share, build brand recognition, or deter potential competitors, even at the expense of lower profits.\n\n**B) The firm wishes to increase its output.**\nThis is a correct explanation. For a firm facing a downward-sloping demand curve, the profit-maximising output level (where MR=MC) is always lower than the revenue-maximising output level (where MR=0), assuming positive marginal costs. To move from the point where MR=MC to where MR=0, the firm must increase its production volume. This increase in output is a direct consequence of shifting from a profit-maximising to a revenue-maximising strategy.\n\n**C) The firm wishes to reduce prices.**\nThis is also a correct explanation. According to the law of demand, to sell a higher quantity of a good, a firm must lower its price. Since changing the production aim from MR=MC to MR=0 involves increasing output (as explained in B), the firm must necessarily reduce the price of its product to encourage consumers to buy the additional units.

The firm is able to keep the different market segments separate.**\n\nThis is a fundamental condition for third-degree price discrimination to be successful. Third-degree price discrimination involves dividing the total market into distinct sub-markets or segments, each with a different price elasticity of demand (PED), and charging a different price in each segment.\n\nFor this strategy to be profitable, the firm must be able to prevent consumers from moving between segments. Specifically, it must prevent 'seepage' or arbitrage, where consumers who are eligible for a lower price buy the product and resell it to those in a higher-priced segment. In the airline industry, this is achieved by making tickets non-transferable and requiring photo identification that matches the name on the ticket. This ensures that the segments (e.g., leisure travellers who book in advance and business travellers who book last minute) remain separate, allowing the airline to maintain different prices for each.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Consumers are able to buy cheaply and then sell the product at a higher price.**\n\nThis condition describes arbitrage. The ability of consumers to engage in arbitrage would make third-degree price discrimination impossible. If consumers in the low-price segment could resell the product to consumers in the high-price segment, the firm's attempt to charge a higher price to the second group would be undermined. The market would eventually converge to a single price, eliminating the price differential and the extra profit from discrimination. Therefore, a necessary condition for price discrimination is the *prevention* of arbitrage, not its existence.\n\n**B. Price elasticity of demand is the same for all consumers in the market.**\n\nThe entire rationale for a firm to practice third-degree price discrimination is to exploit differences in price elasticity of demand among different consumer groups. A profit-maximising firm will charge a higher price to the market segment with a more inelastic demand and a lower price to the segment with a more elastic demand. If the price elasticity of demand were the same for all consumers, there would be no basis for segmenting the market and no additional profit to be gained from charging different prices. The firm would maximise its profit by charging a single, uniform price to all consumers.\n\n**C. The firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve.**\n\nA firm facing a perfectly elastic demand curve is a price taker, characteristic of a perfectly competitive market structure. Such a firm has no market power and cannot influence the price of its product; it must accept the prevailing market price. A prerequisite for any form of price discrimination is that the firm must have some degree of monopoly or market power, which is represented by a downward-sloping demand curve. This power allows the firm to be a price maker and set different prices for different groups without losing all of its customers. Therefore, facing a perfectly elastic demand curve is inconsistent with the ability to price discriminate."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_188.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "8 what is not an example of a moral hazard?\na_ people with a higher risk of unemployment are more likely to undertake training.\nb_ people with free dental care are less likely to take care of their teeth with good oral hygiene.\nc_ people with insurance against car theft are more likely to park their car in high crime areas.\nd_ people with unemployment benefits are less likely to undertake retraining if they become\nunemployed.", "Chapter": 25, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThis scenario is an example of **adverse selection**, not moral hazard. Adverse selection occurs *before* a transaction, where individuals with a higher pre-existing risk are more likely to seek out a product or service to mitigate that risk. In this case, those who perceive a greater risk of unemployment (a pre-existing condition) are more likely to \"purchase\" training to improve their job security. This is a rational, risk-reducing action based on existing information, not a change in behaviour resulting from being insured against a risk.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. People with free dental care are less likely to take care of their teeth with good oral hygiene.**\nThis is a classic example of **moral hazard**. Moral hazard describes a change in behaviour *after* a contract or agreement is in place. Here, the provision of free dental care (the \"insurance\") reduces the personal financial cost of poor oral hygiene. Consequently, individuals have less incentive to take preventative measures (like diligent brushing and flossing), leading to riskier behaviour because they are insulated from the full negative consequences.\n\n**C. People with insurance against car theft are more likely to park their car in high crime areas.**\nThis is a clear illustration of **moral hazard**. After purchasing car insurance, the owner's behaviour changes. They may become less cautious about where they park because the financial loss from a potential theft will be covered by the insurance company. The insurance contract alters the individual's incentives, encouraging them to take on more risk than they would if they were uninsured.\n\n**D. People with unemployment benefits are less likely to undertake retraining if they become unemployed.**\nThis is another example of **moral hazard**. The unemployment benefits act as a form of insurance against job loss. Once a person is unemployed and receiving these benefits, the financial pressure to find a new job immediately is reduced. This can create a disincentive for the individual to invest time and effort in retraining, as the safety net of the benefits makes the state of unemployment less costly for them. This change in behaviour after the insured event (job loss) occurs is characteristic of moral hazard."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_189.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "9 in recent years, the fuel cost of operating a jet aircraft has declined. over the same period,\nimproved design has led to much quieter aircraft.\nhow would this affect the marginal private cost (mpc) and the marginal external cost (mec) of air\ntravel?\na adownward shift of both the mpc and the mec curves\nb  adownward shift of the mpc curve and a movement left along the mec curve\nc amovement left along both the mpc and the mec curves\nd amovement left along the mpc curve and a downward shift of the mec curve", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe marginal private cost (MPC) represents the cost to the producer (the airline) of producing one additional unit of output (e.g., one more flight). A decline in the fuel cost directly reduces the airline's cost of operation. Since this cost reduction applies at every level of output, it causes the entire MPC curve to shift downwards.\n\nThe marginal external cost (MEC) represents the cost imposed on third parties by the production of one additional unit of output. A major external cost of air travel is noise pollution affecting communities near airports. The introduction of quieter aircraft, due to improved design, reduces the amount of noise generated per flight. This diminishes the negative externality, lowering the external cost at every level of output. Consequently, the MEC curve also shifts downwards.\n\nTherefore, the decline in fuel costs shifts the MPC curve down, and the introduction of quieter aircraft shifts the MEC curve down.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: a downward shift of the MPC curve and a movement left along the MEC curve**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the downward shift of the MPC curve due to lower fuel costs. However, it incorrectly describes the effect on the MEC curve. A movement along the MEC curve would occur if the quantity of air travel changed while the external cost per flight remained the same. The scenario describes an improvement in technology (quieter aircraft) that fundamentally reduces the external cost at *every* level of output, which is represented by a downward shift of the entire MEC curve, not a movement along it.\n\n**C: a movement left along both the MPC and the MEC curves**\n\nThis option is incorrect because the changes described are not related to a change in the quantity of air travel, which would cause a movement along the curves. Instead, the scenario describes changes in the underlying determinants of cost. A fall in input prices (fuel) and an improvement in technology (quieter engines) both cause the respective cost curves (MPC and MEC) to shift, as the cost for any given quantity has now changed.\n\n**D: a movement left along the MPC curve and a downward shift of the MEC curve**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the downward shift of the MEC curve due to quieter aircraft.

It hires workers up to the point where the wage rate (W) is equal to the Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRP_L). The MRP_L curve represents the firm's demand for labour, and it is downward sloping due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. When a trade union successfully negotiates a higher wage, the cost of hiring each worker increases. To maintain profit maximisation, the firm will adjust its employment level. At the new, higher wage, the firm will move up along its fixed MRP_L curve to a new equilibrium. This new point corresponds to a lower quantity of labour demanded. Therefore, for a firm in a competitive market, an enforced wage increase will lead to a decrease in employment.\n\n**Explanation for Firm L (Monopsony Market):**\n\nA monopsony is a single buyer of labour. Unlike a competitive firm, a monopsonist faces an upward-sloping supply curve for labour, meaning it must offer a higher wage to attract more workers. This also means its Marginal Cost of Labour (MC_L) curve lies above the supply curve. The monopsonist maximises profit by hiring where MRP_L = MC_L, resulting in a lower level of employment and a lower wage than in a competitive market.\n\nWhen a trade union intervenes and sets a minimum wage above the monopsonist's original wage, the labour supply curve faced by the firm changes. It becomes horizontal at the new union wage, up to the point where it intersects the original supply curve. Over this range, the marginal cost of hiring an additional worker is now constant and equal to the union wage. This new MC_L is lower than the monopsonist's original MC_L curve. The firm will now hire workers up to the point where MRP_L equals this new, lower MC_L. This results in a higher level of employment. Essentially, the union's wage floor counteracts the monopsonist's power to suppress employment, leading to a situation where both wages and employment can increase (up to the competitive equilibrium level).\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A: employment will decrease (firm K), employment will decrease (firm L)**\n    This is incorrect because, in a monopsony market (Firm L), the introduction of a minimum wage by a trade union is likely to increase employment, not decrease it, by correcting the market failure caused by monopsony power.\n\n*   **C: employment will increase (firm K), employment will decrease (firm L)**\n    This is incorrect for both firms. For Firm K (competitive), a higher wage increases the cost of labour, leading to a reduction in the quantity of labour demanded and thus a decrease in employment. For Firm L (monopsony), employment is likely to increase.\n\n*   **D: employment will increase (firm K), employment will increase (firm L)**\n    This is incorrect because for a firm in a competitive market (Firm K), an increase in the mandatory wage rate will make labour more expensive, causing the firm to reduce employment to maximise profits."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_191.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "11 a backward-sloping supply curve of labour is one where, beyond a certain point, the supply of\nlabour\na decreases as the demand for labour rises.\nb_ increases as the demand for labour rises.\nc_ decreases as wages rise.\nd_ increases as wages rise.", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: C**\n\nA backward-sloping supply curve of labour demonstrates a situation where, after the wage rate surpasses a certain level, a further increase in the wage rate leads to a decrease in the quantity of labour supplied. This phenomenon is explained by the interplay of the income effect and the substitution effect of a wage change.\n\n*   **Substitution Effect:** A higher wage increases the opportunity cost of leisure. This incentivises individuals to substitute leisure time for work, thus increasing the hours they are willing to supply.\n*   **Income Effect:** A higher wage increases an individual's total income for a given number of hours worked. Assuming leisure is a normal good, as income rises, the individual will want to consume more of it, meaning they will choose to work fewer hours.\n\nAt lower wage rates, the substitution effect typically outweighs the income effect, resulting in a conventional upward-sloping supply curve. However, beyond a certain high wage level, the income effect may begin to dominate the substitution effect. At this point, individuals may have reached a target income level and prioritise additional leisure over additional income. Consequently, a rise in the wage rate prompts them to reduce their working hours, causing the labour supply curve to bend backward.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThe supply curve of labour illustrates the relationship between the quantity of labour supplied and the wage rate (the price of labour), not the demand for labour. While a rise in the demand for labour will typically cause the equilibrium wage rate to increase (a movement along the supply curve), the shape of the supply curve itself is determined by how workers respond to changes in the wage, not directly to changes in demand. Therefore, describing the supply of labour as decreasing in response to a rise in demand is conceptually incorrect.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis statement incorrectly links the supply of labour directly to the demand for labour. A labour supply curve maps the relationship between the wage rate and the quantity of hours workers are willing to supply. A change in the demand for labour is a shift of the demand curve, which leads to a change in the equilibrium wage and a corresponding movement along the given supply curve. The supply relationship itself is with the wage rate, not demand.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option describes the conventional, upward-sloping portion of the labour supply curve, not the backward-sloping section. At lower to moderate wage levels, the substitution effect of a wage increase is stronger than the income effect. This means that as wages rise, the higher opportunity cost of leisure incentivises individuals to work more hours.

This increases an individual's non-labour income. According to the labour-leisure trade-off model, this creates an income effect. As individuals' incomes rise, they can afford to consume more of all normal goods, including leisure. Consequently, some individuals may choose to work fewer hours, pursue education, engage in caregiving, or exit the labour force entirely, thereby reducing the overall supply of labour.\n\n*   **Improves equality:** By providing a basic income floor for every citizen, a UBI directly addresses poverty and income inequality. The transfer is universal, but its impact is progressive.

A UBI is a form of income redistribution, a core mechanism for improving equality by establishing an income floor.

Increasing the tax rates for the highest earners reduces their disposable income. The additional government revenue generated can be used to fund redistributive programmes. This directly narrows the gap between the highest and lowest incomes.\n2.  **Reduce indirect taxes:** Indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, are regressive. They take a larger proportion of income from lower-income households, as these households tend to spend a greater percentage of their income on goods and services. Reducing indirect taxes, therefore, provides proportionally more relief to the poor, increasing their real disposable income and purchasing power.\n3.  **Increase the value of state benefits:** State benefits, such as unemployment assistance, housing support, and social security payments, are a form of transfer payment. They directly supplement the income of the poorest and most vulnerable households. Increasing the value of these benefits raises the income floor and directly reduces the income gap.\n\nCollectively, these three policies create a powerful redistributive effect, making this the most effective combination.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **A: increase (top rates of income tax), increase (indirect taxes), increase (state benefits)**\n    This policy combination contains a contradictory measure. While increasing progressive income taxes and increasing state benefits would help reduce inequality, increasing indirect taxes would work against this goal. Because indirect taxes are regressive, an increase would disproportionately burden lower-income households, reducing their real disposable income and thus widening inequality. The contradictory nature of these policies makes this combination less effective than B.\n\n*   **C: reduce (top rates of income tax), increase (indirect taxes), reduce (state benefits)**\n    This combination of policies would actively *increase* income inequality. Reducing the top rates of income tax would increase the disposable income of the highest earners. Increasing regressive indirect taxes would place a heavier burden on lower-income households. Reducing the value of state benefits would directly lower the income of the poorest individuals. Every measure in this option widens the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n*   **D: reduce (top rates of income tax), reduce (indirect taxes), reduce (state benefits)**\n    This combination of policies would also likely lead to a significant *increase* in income inequality. Reducing top income tax rates benefits the wealthy, while reducing state benefits directly harms the poor, both actions widening the income gap. Although reducing regressive indirect taxes would help lower-income households, this effect is likely to be outweighed by the much larger, direct impact of lower taxes for the rich and reduced transfer payments for the poor.

This incentivises households to save less and spend more of their disposable income, leading to an increase in consumption (C). Furthermore, lower interest rates across the economy make it cheaper for firms to borrow funds to finance new projects and capital purchases, thus stimulating an increase in investment (I). As both consumption and investment are key components of aggregate demand, their increase will cause the AD curve to shift to the right, resulting in a higher level of real output and thus a larger national income.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. a fall in the prices of imported goods**\n\nA fall in the prices of imported goods is unlikely to lead to an increase in national income. While it increases the real income of consumers, it also encourages them to substitute domestically produced goods with cheaper imports. This would cause spending on imports (M) to rise. Since net exports (X-M) are a component of aggregate demand, an increase in M would lead to a decrease in net exports and consequently a fall in aggregate demand (a leftward shift of the AD curve), which would reduce national income. Although cheaper imported raw materials could lower production costs and increase short-run aggregate supply (SRAS), the negative impact on AD through increased import expenditure is typically more direct and significant.\n\n**C. a decrease in government spending**\n\nA decrease in government spending represents a contractionary fiscal policy. Government spending (G) is a direct component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + X - M). Therefore, a reduction in G will directly cause a decrease in aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the left. This leads to a lower equilibrium level of output and a fall in the size of the national income.\n\n**D. an increase in direct taxes**\n\nAn increase in direct taxes, such as income tax or corporation tax, is a form of contractionary fiscal policy. Higher income taxes reduce the disposable income of households, leading to a decrease in consumption (C). Similarly, higher corporation taxes reduce the post-tax profits available for firms to reinvest, leading to a decrease in investment (I). As both C and I are major components of aggregate demand, a reduction in both will cause aggregate demand to fall (shifting the AD curve to the left), resulting in a decrease in the size of the national income."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_196.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "16 which government policy is most likely to improve occupational mobility?\na_ decreased income tax rates\nb_ increased government spending on education and training\nc_ increased government spending on infrastructure\nd_ increased subsidies to firms to employ school leavers", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nOccupational mobility refers to the ability of a worker to change occupations or move between jobs that require different skills. The primary barrier to occupational mobility is often a lack of the necessary skills, qualifications, or training for a different role. Increased government spending on education and training directly addresses this barrier. By funding universities, vocational schools, and retraining programmes, the government enhances the human capital of the workforce. This equips workers with new, transferable skills, making it easier for them to transition from declining industries to growing ones or to move into higher-skilled positions. Therefore, this policy is the most direct and effective way to improve occupational mobility.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. decreased income tax rates**\nThis policy increases a worker's disposable income and can strengthen the financial incentive to work or seek a higher-paying job. However, it does not provide the worker with the actual ability or skills required to qualify for a different occupation. While a lower tax burden might motivate a worker to *want* to change jobs, it does not overcome the fundamental skills gap that prevents them from doing so. Thus, its effect on occupational mobility is indirect and less significant than policies that build human capital.\n\n**C. increased government spending on infrastructure**\nImprovements in infrastructure, such as transport networks (roads, railways) and communication systems, primarily enhance **geographical mobility**. This is the ease with which workers can move to different locations for work. While better transport might allow a worker to access a job in a different location (which could be a different occupation), the policy itself does not equip them with the skills to change their type of work. Its main impact is on reducing the friction of distance, not on overcoming skill-based barriers between occupations.\n\n**D. increased subsidies to firms to employ school leavers**\nThis policy is a targeted measure designed to reduce youth unemployment by lowering the cost to firms of hiring inexperienced workers. Its primary goal is to facilitate the entry of young people into the labour market, helping them gain their first job and initial work experience. While this experience is valuable for future career progression, the policy itself is not aimed at improving the ability of the general workforce to switch between different occupations. It is focused on a specific demographic at the start of their careers, not on the broader concept of occupational mobility for all workers."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_197.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "17 the table shows the marginal propensity to consume (mpc), marginal propensity to save (mps),\nmarginal rate of taxation (mrt) and marginal propensity to import (mpm) for a four-sector\neconomy.\n\n| vate]\nmpc 0.5\nmps 0.2\nmrt 0.2\nmpm 0.1\nwhat is the size of the multiplier?\na 1 b 2 cc 5 d 10", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe multiplier effect describes how an initial change in autonomous spending (such as investment or government expenditure) leads to a proportionately larger change in the final equilibrium national income.

For the multiplier to be 1, the marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW) would have to be 1 (since k = 1/MPW). This would imply that 100% of any new income is immediately withdrawn from the circular flow through savings, taxes, and imports. Based on the provided data, the MPW is 0.5 (0.2 + 0.2 + 0.1), not 1.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nA multiplier of 5 would imply a marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW) of 0.2 (since k = 1 / MPW \u2192 MPW = 1/k = 1/5 = 0.2). This result might be obtained by incorrectly considering only a single leakage, such as the marginal propensity to save (MPS = 0.2) or the marginal rate of taxation (MRT = 0.2), as the total MPW.

This figure is equal to the marginal propensity to import (MPM) given in the table. This calculation is incorrect as it neglects the other two forms of leakages from the circular flow of income: savings (MPS = 0.2) and taxation (MRT = 0.2).

This is represented by an outward shift of the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF). This expansion means the economy can produce a greater quantity and a wider variety of goods and services than before. In a free enterprise system, profit-seeking firms will utilise this enhanced capacity to cater to and create new consumer demands. This leads to innovation and diversification of products. Consequently, individuals (consumers) are presented with a broader range of goods and services, which increases their choices and can lead to a higher standard of living.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Future generations will be less well-off than present generations.**\n\nThis statement is contrary to the expected effects of increased productive capacity. An increase in productive capacity is the foundation of economic growth. Economic growth typically leads to higher real incomes, improved technology, and a greater availability of goods and services. This means that, all else being equal, future generations are likely to be *more* well-off, with a higher standard of living than present generations.\n\n**B. Increasing the production of one good cannot be done without decreasing the production of another.**\n\nThis statement describes the situation of an economy operating at full capacity *on* a fixed Production Possibility Frontier (PPF). At any given point on the PPF, resources are fully and efficiently employed, creating a trade-off (opportunity cost) between producing different goods. However, the question describes an *increase* in productive capacity, which means the entire PPF shifts outwards. This outward shift makes it possible to produce more of all goods, moving from a point on the original PPF to a new, previously unattainable point on the new PPF.\n\n**D. Rising levels of output will cause per capita incomes to equalise.**\n\nWhile an increase in productive capacity and output will likely raise the *average* per capita income, it does not inherently cause incomes to equalise. In a free enterprise economy, income distribution is determined by the market value of an individual's contribution to production (e.g., wages, profits, rent, interest) and their ownership of factors of production. Economic growth can, and often does, occur alongside stable or even widening income inequality, as the returns to capital, skills, and entrepreneurship may not be distributed evenly across the population. Income equalisation is typically a goal of government policy (e.g., progressive taxation and transfer payments), not an automatic outcome of market-led growth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_199.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "19 the accelerator principle refers to a relationship between investment and\na the level of gdp.\nb_ changes in gdp.\nc the level of interest rates.\nd_ changes in interest rates.", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe accelerator principle states that the level of net investment is directly related to the rate of change of national income (GDP). When an economy experiences growth, meaning GDP is increasing, firms must increase their capital stock (e.g., machinery, equipment, buildings) to meet the higher demand for goods and services. This increase in the capital stock is net investment. Therefore, a positive change in GDP induces a higher level of investment. Conversely, if the rate of GDP growth slows down, even if GDP is still rising, the level of net investment will fall. This creates a volatile and amplified relationship between changes in GDP and the level of investment spending.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. the level of GDP.**\nThe accelerator principle is concerned with the *change* in GDP, not its absolute level. An economy could have a very high but stagnant level of GDP. In this situation, firms would have no incentive to expand their productive capacity, as existing demand is not growing. Consequently, net investment (additions to the capital stock) would be close to zero, with firms only undertaking replacement investment to cover depreciation. The accelerator effect is only triggered by growth in output.\n\n**C. the level of interest rates.**\nThe relationship between investment and the level of interest rates is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics, but it is not the accelerator principle. According to standard investment theory, there is an inverse relationship between the level of interest rates and the level of investment. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and the opportunity cost of using retained funds for investment, thus discouraging investment projects. This describes the cost-of-capital effect on investment, whereas the accelerator principle describes the demand-driven effect.\n\n**D. changes in interest rates.**\nChanges in interest rates do affect investment. For instance, a fall in interest rates will lower the cost of capital and stimulate a higher level of investment, causing a movement along the investment demand curve. However, this is distinct from the accelerator principle. The accelerator model focuses on how changes in aggregate demand and output (proxied by changes in GDP) influence firms' decisions to invest in new capital, assuming a given cost of capital."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_200.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is likely to be the effect of an increase in the budget deficit?\na_anincrease in effective demand\nb_anincrease in unemployment\nc_ areduction in inflation\nd areduction in the volume of spending", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAn increase in the government's budget deficit occurs when government expenditure exceeds its tax revenue by a larger amount. This can be caused by an increase in government spending, a reduction in taxation, or a combination of both. These actions constitute an expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy is designed to increase aggregate demand (AD). An increase in government spending (G) is a direct injection into the circular flow of income, thereby increasing AD. A reduction in taxes (T) increases the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms, which stimulates consumption (C) and investment (I), both of which are key components of AD. The term 'effective demand' refers to the total demand for goods and services in an economy that is backed by the ability to pay; in macroeconomic terms, this is equivalent to aggregate demand. Therefore, an increase in the budget deficit directly leads to an increase in effective demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **B: an increase in unemployment**\n    An increase in the budget deficit stimulates aggregate demand. As demand for goods and services rises, firms are likely to increase their production levels. To do so, they will need to hire more labour, leading to a *decrease* in cyclical unemployment, not an increase.\n\n*   **C: a reduction in inflation**\n    An increase in the budget deficit leads to a rise in aggregate demand. In the AD/AS model, a rightward shift of the AD curve, particularly when the economy is operating near its full capacity, puts upward pressure on the general price level. This is known as demand-pull inflation. Consequently, an increased budget deficit is more likely to cause an *increase* in inflation, not a reduction.\n\n*   **D: a reduction in the volume of spending**\n    The \"volume of spending\" refers to the total expenditure in the economy, which is another term for aggregate demand. An increase in the budget deficit, through higher government spending or lower taxes, is explicitly intended to *increase* the overall volume of spending in the economy to stimulate economic activity.

The sale of resources like oil, minerals, or timber on international markets generates significant export revenue, boosting national income and government tax receipts.\n\nHowever, this policy does not necessarily promote economic development, which is a broader concept concerned with improvements in the standard of living, well-being, and capabilities of the population. Over-reliance on resource extraction can lead to several negative outcomes that hinder development:\n*   **Environmental Degradation:** Extraction processes often cause significant air and water pollution, deforestation, and habitat loss, which reduce the quality of life and can harm health.\n*   **Resource Depletion:** Finite resources are non-renewable. Basing an economy on their extraction is unsustainable in the long run, potentially leaving future generations with fewer opportunities.\n*   **Increased Inequality:** The wealth generated from natural resources is often concentrated in the hands of a small elite or multinational corporations, exacerbating income inequality rather than improving the welfare of the general population.\n*   **The 'Resource Curse' (Dutch Disease):** A boom in the natural resource sector can cause the country's currency to appreciate, making other sectors like manufacturing and agriculture less competitive internationally, thus harming economic diversification.\n\nTherefore, while GDP may rise, the overall standard of living and long-term economic health may stagnate or even decline.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. creating a more equal distribution of income and wealth**\nThis policy is a central component of economic development. Economic development is not just about increasing total income but also about ensuring the benefits of growth are shared widely.

An educated population leads to improved health outcomes, greater political stability, higher productivity, and increased earning potential for individuals. These are all key indicators of development. Furthermore, investment in education is a primary driver of long-term, sustainable economic growth, as it enhances the skills and productivity of the labour force.\n\n**D. introducing tighter controls on air pollution**\nThis policy is aimed at improving environmental quality and public health, which are core aspects of economic development.

The curve suggests that as tax rates increase from 0%, tax revenue will also increase. However, after a certain point on the curve, any further increase in the tax rate will cause a decline in total tax revenue. This is because excessively high tax rates can disincentivise work, saving, and investment, thereby shrinking the tax base (the total amount of income or profit that can be taxed).\n\nA policy of cutting direct taxes (such as income and corporation tax) is directly based on the logic of the Laffer curve. Proponents of this policy argue that if an economy is operating on the downward-sloping (or 'prohibitive') range of the curve, a cut in tax rates will boost incentives for individuals to work harder and for firms to invest and expand. This increase in economic activity would broaden the tax base to such an extent that it could lead to an increase in total tax revenue, despite the lower rate. This stimulus to the supply side of the economy\u2014encouraging more work and investment\u2014is a way to foster long-run economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. exchange rate depreciation**\nExchange rate depreciation is a fall in the value of a currency in a floating exchange rate system. It can stimulate economic growth by making a country's exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thus increasing net exports and aggregate demand. However, this is a mechanism of monetary or international trade policy, not fiscal policy. The Laffer curve is a concept exclusively related to fiscal policy, specifically the impact of tax rates on economic incentives and government revenue.\n\n**C. investment subsidies**\nInvestment subsidies are payments made by the government to firms to reduce the cost of purchasing new capital. Like a tax cut, this is a supply-side policy designed to encourage investment and thus economic growth. However, it is not based on the Laffer curve concept. The Laffer curve's core principle is the relationship between tax *rates*, the tax *base*, and tax *revenue*. A subsidy is a form of government spending or expenditure, not a change in the tax rate. While it aims for a similar outcome (more investment), its theoretical basis is different.\n\n**D. quantitative easing**\nQuantitative easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy tool where a central bank purchases long-term securities from the open market to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment.

This has several key consequences for the domestic economy.\n\n1.  **Impact on Imported Inflation:** When the domestic currency appreciates, it can purchase more of a foreign currency. This makes imported goods and raw materials cheaper in domestic currency terms. A reduction in the price of imported consumer goods directly lowers the Consumer Price Index (CPI), while cheaper imported raw materials reduce production costs for domestic firms. This reduction in cost-push inflationary pressure means that **imported inflation falls**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Impact on Unemployment:** The change in the exchange rate affects the price of exports and imports.\n    *   **Exports** become more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded for exports.\n    *   **Imports** become cheaper for domestic buyers, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded for imports.\n\n    The **Marshall-Lerner condition** states that if the sum of the price elasticities of demand for exports and imports is greater than one (|PEDx + PEDm| > 1), a currency appreciation will lead to a worsening of the current account balance. This is because the fall in export revenue will be greater than the fall in import expenditure (or import expenditure will rise), causing the value of net exports (X-M) to decrease.\n\n    Net exports (X-M) is a key component of aggregate demand (AD), where AD = C + I + G + (X-M). A decrease in net exports will cause a leftward shift in the AD curve. This reduction in aggregate demand leads to a fall in real output (real GDP). As firms reduce their production levels to match the lower demand, they will require fewer workers, leading to an increase in cyclical (demand-deficient) unemployment. Therefore, **unemployment rises**.\n\nCombining these two outcomes, an exchange rate appreciation, given the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, leads to a fall in imported inflation and a rise in unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A: falls, falls:** While imported inflation does fall, unemployment would not.

This is because average incomes are low, meaning a very large proportion of income must be spent on basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. With a high marginal propensity to consume, there is little disposable income left for saving. This scarcity of domestic savings creates a significant obstacle to financing investment, contributing to a \"vicious cycle of poverty\" where low savings lead to low investment, which in turn leads to slow economic growth and persistently low incomes.\n\nThese countries are also typically characterized by a **low capital-output ratio**. The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital stock (e.g., machinery, infrastructure) needed to produce a unit of output. In low-income countries, production methods are predominantly labor-intensive, relying more on human effort than on sophisticated capital equipment. Because the economy is not capital-intensive, the total value of capital stock is small relative to the level of national output. This results in a low capital-output ratio compared to high-income, capital-intensive economies.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: high saving ratio, low capital-output ratio**\n\nThis option is incorrect because low-income countries are defined by low, not high, saving ratios. The fundamental challenge of poverty means that the majority of income is allocated to immediate consumption, severely limiting the capacity for individual and national savings.\n\n**C: low saving ratio, high capital-output ratio**\n\nWhile this option correctly identifies the saving ratio as low, it incorrectly describes the capital-output ratio as high. A high capital-output ratio is a feature of a capital-intensive economy, where a large amount of capital is used relative to output. Low-income economies are, by their nature, labor-intensive.

Low-income countries typically exhibit a low saving ratio due to low per capita income and a low capital-output ratio due to the labor-intensive structure of their economies.

This process involves the greater integration of national economies through the reduction of trade barriers, advancements in transportation and communication technologies, and increased flows of capital and labour. A central feature of this globalisation has been a dramatic **increase**, not decrease, in the volume and value of international trade. Organisations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and numerous regional trade agreements have facilitated this expansion, making \"decreased international trade\" the one trend that has definitively not accompanied global economic growth.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a depletion of non-renewable resources**\nThis statement is incorrect because global economic growth has, in fact, been a major driver of the depletion of non-renewable resources. Economic growth is fundamentally linked to increases in production and consumption. These activities require vast inputs of energy and raw materials, such as fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) and minerals (iron ore, copper). As these resources are finite, their accelerated extraction and use to fuel economic expansion directly contribute to their depletion.\n\n**C. growing urbanisation**\nThis statement is incorrect as growing urbanisation has been a significant and consistent feature accompanying global economic growth. As economies develop, they typically undergo a structural transformation, shifting from agricultural-based activities to industrial and service-based sectors. These sectors are predominantly located in cities, creating job opportunities and higher potential wages that attract populations from rural areas. This migration from the countryside to cities is the essence of urbanisation, a trend that has strongly correlated with economic growth worldwide over the past several decades.\n\n**D. increased atmospheric pollution**\nThis statement is incorrect because, on a global scale, economic growth has been associated with increased atmospheric pollution. The industrial processes, energy consumption, and transportation activities that underpin economic growth have historically relied heavily on the combustion of fossil fuels. This releases significant quantities of greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide) and other pollutants into the atmosphere. While some developed nations have made progress in decoupling growth from emissions through technology and regulation, the rapid industrialisation of many large developing economies has contributed to a net increase in global atmospheric pollution over the last 25 years.

It ranges from 0 to 1. A Gini coefficient of 0 signifies perfect equality, where every individual in the economy has the exact same income. Conversely, a Gini coefficient of 1 represents perfect inequality, where a single individual holds all the income, and everyone else has none. Therefore, a change in the Gini coefficient that brings it closer to zero indicates that income is being distributed more equally among the population. This reflects a decrease in the gap between the highest and lowest earners.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) It has moved closer to one.**\nMoving closer to a Gini coefficient of one indicates an increase, not a decrease, in income inequality. A value of one represents the highest possible level of inequality. Thus, a country whose Gini coefficient is rising towards one is experiencing a more unequal distribution of its income.\n\n**C) It has moved from negative to positive.**\nThe Gini coefficient is, by its standard definition, a non-negative value. It is calculated as the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of perfect equality.

Globalisation has led to the development of complex, long-distance supply chains where the production and distribution of goods involve multiple countries. Consequently, nations become highly reliant on one another for finished products, components, and raw materials.

The smooth functioning of one country's infrastructure, in this case, a canal in Egypt, is vital for the economic stability of many others.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: cheaper products for consumers**\nWhile cheaper products can be a consequence of globalisation due to factors like comparative advantage and economies of scale, the Suez Canal blockage does not illustrate this. In fact, the event demonstrates the opposite effect. The disruption to supply chains and the resulting shortages would lead to an increase in shipping costs and a reduction in the supply of goods, ultimately causing prices to rise for consumers, not fall.\n\n**B: greater choice of products for consumers**\nA greater choice of products is a well-established benefit of globalisation, as consumers gain access to goods from all over the world. However, the event described highlights a vulnerability of this system rather than the benefit itself. The blockage led to product shortages, which temporarily *reduced* the choice available to consumers in many markets.

The relationship between them is key:\n1.  As long as marginal utility (MU) is positive, each additional unit consumed adds to the total utility (TU), causing TU to increase. This occurs as consumption rises from 1 to 5 units. Although the MU is diminishing (each new unit adds less satisfaction than the previous one), it is still a positive addition.\n2.  When marginal utility is zero, total utility is at its maximum. This happens at the 5th unit, the point of satiation.\n3.  When marginal utility becomes negative, consuming an additional unit leads to disutility, meaning it subtracts from total satisfaction. This causes total utility to fall. This occurs when consumption moves from the 5th to the 6th unit.\n\nTherefore, as consumption increases from 1 to 6 units, total utility first rises (from unit 1 to 5) and then falls (from unit 5 to 6).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It falls continuously.**\nThis is incorrect. Total utility only falls when marginal utility is negative. Between quantities 1 and 5, the marginal utility is positive. This means that each extra unit consumed during this period adds to total utility, causing it to rise, not fall. A continuous fall would only happen if marginal utility were negative for all units consumed after the first.\n\n**B. It falls and then rises.**\nThis option describes the inverse of the correct relationship. Total utility falls only when marginal utility is negative and rises when marginal utility is positive. The consumption sequence shows positive marginal utility first (from unit 1 to 5), causing total utility to rise, followed by negative marginal utility (from unit 5 to 6), causing total utility to fall.\n\n**C. It rises continuously.**\nThis is incorrect because it ignores the effect of negative marginal utility. While total utility does rise as long as marginal utility is positive (from 1 to 5 units), it begins to fall once marginal utility becomes negative. The consumption of the 6th unit yields negative marginal utility (disutility), which reduces the total utility from its peak at 5 units. Therefore, the rise is not continuous over the entire range."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_212.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "2 anindifference curve is typically drawn with a convex shape.\nwhich economic concept explains the reason for this convex shape?\na allocative efficiency\nb_ diminishing marginal rate of substitution\nc_ pareto optimality\nd the equi-marginal principle", "Chapter": 14, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\nThe convex shape of a typical indifference curve is a direct graphical representation of the principle of the **diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS)**. The MRS measures the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility.\n\nAn indifference curve is convex to the origin because as a consumer consumes more of one good (say, good X on the horizontal axis) and less of another (good Y on the vertical axis), the marginal utility they derive from each additional unit of good X decreases. Simultaneously, the marginal utility of good Y increases as it becomes scarcer in their consumption bundle. Consequently, the consumer is willing to give up progressively fewer units of the now-scarce good Y to obtain one more unit of the now-abundant good X. This changing, diminishing trade-off is reflected in the slope of the indifference curve, which becomes flatter as one moves down along the curve, creating the characteristic convex shape.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\n\n**Allocative efficiency** is an economic outcome where resources are allocated in a way that maximises societal welfare. This state is typically achieved when the price paid by consumers for a good or service is equal to the marginal cost of producing it (P = MC). While consumer preferences (represented by indifference curves) are a fundamental component of determining overall societal welfare, allocative efficiency is a concept of market-level or economy-wide optimality. It describes an efficient state of the market, not the underlying psychological principle of consumer preference that determines the shape of an individual's indifference curve.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: C**\n\n**Pareto optimality**, or Pareto efficiency, describes a situation in an economy where it is impossible to reallocate resources to make any one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off. It is a criterion for judging the efficiency of resource distribution among different economic agents. The shape of an indifference curve, however, is determined by the preferences of a single consumer, independent of the welfare of others. While the concept of Pareto optimality uses indifference curves (for example, in an Edgeworth box diagram to find the contract curve), it does not explain the reason for their convex shape.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThe **equi-marginal principle** states that a rational consumer will maximise their total utility by allocating their expenditure so that the marginal utility per unit of currency spent is equal for all goods consumed (MUx/Px = MUy/Py). This principle explains how a consumer makes an optimal choice and reaches equilibrium, given their budget constraint and their set of indifference curves. It determines the specific point of tangency between the budget line and the highest possible indifference curve. Therefore, the equi-marginal principle explains the consumer's optimal consumption bundle, not the inherent shape of the indifference curves themselves, which is based on preferences alone."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_213.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "3 what is most likely to increase the principal\u2014agent problem?\na ensuring the actions of agents are known by the managers\nb linking the rewards of managers with the profitability of the firm\nc removing from managers the opportunity to hold shares\nd preparing contracts that compel agents to work in the interest of the principal", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe principal-agent problem occurs when the interests of a principal (e.g., shareholders) and an agent (e.g., a manager) are not aligned. This is often due to asymmetric information, where the agent has more information about their actions than the principal. Removing the opportunity for managers to hold shares in the company they manage severs a crucial link that aligns their interests with those of the shareholders. Share ownership gives managers a direct financial stake in the long-term success of the firm. If the firm performs well and its share price increases, the manager's personal wealth also increases. Without this incentive, managers may be more inclined to pursue their own objectives, such as maximising short-term bonuses, enjoying corporate perks, or adopting less risky strategies to protect their own employment, even if these actions do not maximise shareholder value. This divergence of interests intensifies the principal-agent problem.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: ensuring the actions of agents are known by the managers**\n\nThis statement describes increased monitoring. Monitoring is a key strategy used to *reduce* the principal-agent problem. By making the agent's actions more transparent to the principal (or their representatives), it becomes more difficult for the agent to act against the principal's interests without being detected. This reduces the information asymmetry that is central to the problem.\n\n**B: linking the rewards of managers with the profitability of the firm**\n\nThis describes the use of incentive schemes, such as performance-related pay or profit-sharing. These schemes are designed specifically to *solve* the principal-agent problem by aligning the financial interests of the agent (manager) with the goals of the principal (shareholders). When a manager's reward is directly tied to the firm's profitability, they are motivated to make decisions that increase profits, which is the primary objective of the shareholders.\n\n**D: preparing contracts that compel agents to work in the interest of the principal**\n\nThis refers to the use of formal, binding contracts to define the agent's duties and performance expectations. Such contracts are a fundamental tool for mitigating the principal-agent problem. They legally obligate the agent to act in a certain way and can specify penalties for failing to do so.

As demonstrated above, the average fixed cost is not constant; it falls as output rises. For AFC to be constant, the Total Fixed Cost would have to increase in direct proportion to output, which would contradict the definition of a fixed cost.\n\n**C) Average variable cost falls.**\nThis is incorrect.

This has three main effects:\n\n1.  **Average Costs:** Improved technology allows firms to produce the same quantity of output using fewer inputs, or more output with the same inputs. This lowers the cost per unit of production. Consequently, the average total cost (ATC) curve for firms in industry X will shift downwards, from ATC\u2081 to ATC\u2082.\n2.  **Market for X:** As production becomes cheaper and more profitable at any given price, firms are willing and able to supply a greater quantity to the market. This results in an increase in market supply, which is represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve from S\u2083 to S\u2084.\n3.  **Production Possibility Frontier (PPF):** The PPF illustrates the maximum combination of goods an economy can produce. Since the technological improvement is specific to industry X, the economy's capacity to produce good X increases. The capacity to produce good Y remains unchanged. This causes the PPF to pivot outwards along the horizontal axis (good X), moving from the original curve P\u2085 to the new frontier P\u2087.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly identifies that average costs will fall (ATC\u2081 to ATC\u2082). However, it incorrectly suggests that the market supply curve will shift to the left (from S\u2084 to S\u2083), which represents a decrease in supply. A reduction in production costs leads to an *increase* in supply. Furthermore, it incorrectly identifies the new production possibility frontier as P\u2086. P\u2086 represents a technological improvement in the production of good Y, not good X, as only the maximum output on the Y-axis has increased.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly states that average costs will rise (from ATC\u2082 to ATC\u2081). A technological improvement leads to a *decrease* in production costs, not an increase. While the shift in the market supply curve (S\u2083 to S\u2084) is correctly identified as an increase in supply, this is inconsistent with the premise of rising costs. Additionally, the choice of P\u2086 as the new production possibility frontier is incorrect, as this reflects an improvement in the technology for producing good Y, not good X.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect on two of the three points. First, it suggests that average costs will rise (ATC\u2082 to ATC\u2081), which is the opposite of what occurs following a technological improvement. Second, it suggests that market supply will decrease (S\u2084 to S\u2083), whereas lower costs would cause supply to increase.

In this case, the coffee restaurant chain (a retailer at the end of the supply chain) has purchased a coffee bean farm (a primary producer at the beginning of the supply chain). The restaurant chain is integrating \"backwards\" towards its sources of raw materials. This strategic move allows the firm to gain control over its supply of coffee beans, potentially reducing costs, ensuring quality, and securing a consistent supply.\n\n---\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. horizontal integration**\n\nHorizontal integration involves the acquisition of, or merger with, a competitor operating at the same stage of the supply chain. For this to be an example of horizontal integration, the coffee restaurant chain would have needed to purchase another coffee restaurant chain.

For this strategy to be effective, the ability to segment the market is a prerequisite. This separation can be based on various observable characteristics such as age (e.g., child vs. adult movie tickets), geographical location (e.g., different prices for a car model in Europe and North America), or time of purchase (e.g., peak vs. off-peak train fares). Without the ability to divide customers into these separate sub-markets, the firm cannot apply different prices and would have to charge a single price to all consumers.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. All consumers and producers must be in the same geographical location.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While price discrimination can occur within a single geographical location (e.g., student discounts at a local cinema), it is not a necessary condition. In fact, geographical separation is a common basis for creating separate markets for third-degree price discrimination. For instance, a pharmaceutical company may sell the same drug at a higher price in a high-income country and a lower price in a low-income country. Therefore, consumers and producers do not need to be in the same location; what is necessary is the ability to keep the markets separate to prevent arbitrage (resale).\n\n**C. Each separate market must have identical price elasticities of demand.**\nThis is the opposite of a necessary condition for profitable price discrimination. The primary incentive for a firm to engage in third-degree price discrimination is the existence of *different* price elasticities of demand (PED) among the separated market groups. A firm maximises its profit by charging a higher price to the group with a more inelastic demand (consumers are less responsive to price changes) and a lower price to the group with a more elastic demand (consumers are more responsive to price changes). If all market segments had identical PEDs, there would be no benefit to charging different prices, and a single uniform price would be optimal.\n\n**D. Price undercutting is required to enter a monopolistic market.**\nThis statement describes a competitive strategy for market entry, not a condition for price discrimination. Price undercutting is a tactic a firm might use to gain market share from incumbent rivals, particularly in an oligopolistic market structure. Third-degree price discrimination, by contrast, is a strategy employed by a firm that already possesses significant market power (like a monopolist).

In this scenario, the economic decision is made by the car drivers who choose to switch to motorcycles. Therefore, any benefit that directly accrues to these specific individuals is considered a private benefit. A faster journey for those who switched is a direct, personal gain resulting from their decision to use a motorcycle, which can often navigate through traffic more quickly than a car.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: faster journeys for those who continued to go by car**\n\nThis is an example of a positive externality, also known as an external benefit. An external benefit is a positive effect that an activity imposes on an uninvolved third party. The individuals who continued to go by car did not make the decision to switch, but they benefit from the reduced traffic congestion caused by others switching. Because the benefit is enjoyed by those who were not party to the economic decision, it is an external, not a private, benefit.\n\n**C: increased safety for cyclists**\n\nThis is also an external benefit. Cyclists are third parties to the decision made by car drivers. If fewer cars on the road lead to a safer environment for cyclists, this is a positive side-effect of the switch to motorcycles. The benefit does not accrue to the individuals who made the decision (the motorcyclists), but to another group (cyclists).\n\n**D: reduced levels of air pollution for pedestrians**\n\nThis is another clear example of a positive externality. Pedestrians benefit from the improved air quality resulting from fewer cars being on the road. They are third parties who did not participate in the decision to switch from cars to motorcycles.

Valuing these effects (e.g., the cost of air pollution or the benefit of a scenic view) is inherently difficult and subjective. The methods used, such as contingent valuation, involve estimation and surveys, which can be imprecise. A high proportion of such external effects means a larger part of the CBA is based on these uncertain valuations, reducing its overall accuracy.\n\n2.  **High Percentage of Future Costs and Benefits:** Costs and benefits that are expected to occur far into the future are subject to significant uncertainty. Forecasting future economic conditions, technological changes, and social preferences is inherently speculative. Furthermore, to make future values comparable to present ones, they must be discounted to a present value. The choice of the social discount rate is a critical and often controversial decision. A small change in the discount rate can have a large impact on the present value of long-term costs and benefits, potentially altering the outcome of the analysis. A high percentage of future values, therefore, introduces greater uncertainty and reliance on a subjective discount rate, which reduces the accuracy of the CBA.\n\nWhen both of these conditions are met, the reliability of the CBA is significantly compromised.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: high | low\n\nThis option suggests a high proportion of external costs and benefits but a low percentage of future costs and benefits. While a high proportion of externalities does reduce the accuracy of a CBA due to the difficulty of their valuation, having most costs and benefits occur in the present or near future (a low percentage in the future) actually *increases* accuracy. Current costs and benefits are more certain and do not require discounting over long, uncertain periods. Because one factor reduces accuracy while the other enhances it, this scenario is not the most likely to cause the greatest reduction in accuracy compared to when both factors contribute to inaccuracy.\n\n#### C: low | high\n\nThis option suggests a low proportion of external costs and benefits but a high percentage of future costs and benefits. A high percentage of future costs and benefits reduces accuracy due to forecasting uncertainty and the sensitivity of the analysis to the chosen discount rate. However, a low proportion of externalities *increases* accuracy, as most costs and benefits are private and can be more easily and objectively measured using market data. The presence of this accuracy-enhancing factor means this combination is less likely to reduce overall accuracy than the combination in option A, where both factors contribute to inaccuracy.\n\n#### D: low | low\n\nThis option suggests both a low proportion of external costs and benefits and a low percentage of future costs and benefits. These are, in fact, the conditions under which a cost-benefit analysis is *most likely to be accurate*. A low proportion of externalities means the analysis relies primarily on directly measurable private costs and benefits. A low percentage of future effects means there is less reliance on uncertain long-term forecasts and controversial discount rates.

A Pareto improvement is a reallocation of resources that makes at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off. This is the exact definition provided in option C. An economic state is considered **Pareto optimal** (or Pareto efficient) when no further Pareto improvements can be made. At this point, it is impossible to reallocate resources to make one person better off without necessarily making at least one other person worse off. Therefore, any change that benefits someone without harming anyone else is, by definition, a step towards achieving Pareto optimality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** The presence of a negative externality signifies a market failure and a state of **Pareto inefficiency**. A negative externality occurs when an economic activity imposes a cost on a third party, reducing their utility. This means resources are misallocated because the social costs of the activity are higher than the private costs. The existence of such an externality is a condition that moves an economy *away* from Pareto optimality, as it creates a situation where it is possible to make people better off (e.g., by reducing the externality) without making others worse off.\n\n*   **B:** Non-rivalry is a characteristic of a good, specifically a public good, where one individual's consumption does not reduce the availability of the good for others. While the efficient provision of public goods is a component of an overall Pareto optimal economy, the mere existence of a non-rival good does not constitute a movement towards optimality. In fact, due to the free-rider problem, non-rival goods are often under-provided by the market, leading to a Pareto inefficient outcome. The characteristic itself is static; it is not a \"movement\" or a reallocation of resources.\n\n*   **D:** This scenario describes a trade that makes one nation better off *at the expense* of another. This directly violates the condition for a Pareto improvement, which stipulates that **no one** can be made worse off. A situation where one party's gain is another party's loss is not a move towards Pareto optimality. In contrast, mutually beneficial voluntary trade, where both parties gain, is a classic example of a Pareto improvement.

For a given equilibrium wage rate, the economic rent is the area above the supply curve and below the wage rate. Therefore, the short-run economic rent is the sum of areas X and Y. Transfer earnings in the short run are the area below the short-run supply curve, which includes area Z.\n\nIn the long run, the supply of labour becomes more elastic as workers have more time to acquire skills, retrain, or relocate. This is shown by the flatter 'long run' supply curve. At the same equilibrium, the long-run economic rent is now only area X, as this is the area above the new, more elastic long-run supply curve. The transfer earnings in the long run are the area below the long-run supply curve, which now comprises areas Y and Z.\n\nComparing the two situations, area Y was part of the economic rent in the short run but has become part of the transfer earnings in the long run.

In the short run, area Y is economic rent, while area Z is part of the transfer earnings. The question asks for the area that *turns from* economic rent *to* transfer earnings.

Government policies can increase MPL by improving the quality of labour itself (human capital) or by increasing the quantity and quality of other factors of production that labour works with, particularly capital.\n\n1.  **Better Education:** Government investment in education and training enhances the skills, knowledge, and efficiency of the workforce. A more educated and skilled worker is capable of producing more output in a given period, using resources more effectively, and adapting to new technologies more quickly. This direct improvement in the quality of labour, or human capital, raises the marginal productivity of labour. Therefore, introducing better education is a valid policy.\n\n2.  **Tax Allowances for Capital Goods:** Providing tax allowances (such as investment tax credits or accelerated depreciation) reduces the after-tax cost of purchasing capital goods for firms. This creates a strong incentive for firms to invest in more and newer machinery, technology, and equipment. When workers are equipped with more advanced and efficient capital, their output per hour increases significantly. This process, known as capital deepening, means that each worker has more capital to work with, directly boosting their productivity. Consequently, the marginal productivity of labour rises.\n\nSince both policies contribute to increasing the marginal productivity of labour, option D is the correct answer.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** This option is incorrect because it dismisses two effective policies for raising the marginal productivity of labour. Both improving human capital (via education) and increasing physical capital (via tax incentives) are standard methods for enhancing labour productivity.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect because it fails to recognise the impact of education on labour productivity. A fundamental driver of productivity growth is the improvement of human capital, which is a primary outcome of better education and training.\n\n*   **C:** This option is incorrect because it overlooks the complementary relationship between capital and labour. Providing workers with more and better tools (capital) is a critical way to increase their output and, therefore, their marginal productivity.

The national minimum wage acts as a wage floor, establishing the lowest legal hourly rate an employer can pay. By removing this protection, firms may be able to lower the wages of their least-skilled workers, especially in markets with an excess supply of labour. This would cause the incomes of the lowest-paid workers to fall. Relative poverty is measured in relation to the median income of a country. As the incomes of the poorest individuals decrease while the median income remains unchanged or falls by less, the income gap widens. Consequently, a greater number of people will fall below the relative poverty line (e.g., 60% of median income), thereby increasing the rate of relative poverty.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. increasing means-tested benefit levels**\nThis action would likely decrease relative poverty. Means-tested benefits are transfer payments made by the government specifically to individuals and households with low income and assets. Increasing the level of these benefits directly raises the disposable income of the poorest members of society, bringing their income closer to the median income. This narrows the income distribution at the lower end and reduces the incidence of relative poverty.\n\n**B. increasing the power of trade unions**\nThis action would likely decrease relative poverty. Trade unions engage in collective bargaining on behalf of workers to secure higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. An increase in their power would likely lead to more successful wage negotiations, particularly benefiting workers in lower- and middle-income brackets. This would raise the incomes of these workers, reducing income inequality and thereby decreasing relative poverty.\n\n**C. making the tax system more progressive**\nThis action would likely decrease relative poverty. A progressive tax system is one where the average tax rate rises with income. Making the system *more* progressive involves increasing taxes on higher earners at a faster rate than on lower earners. This policy is a key tool for income redistribution. The increased tax revenue from the wealthy can be used to fund public services or increase transfer payments to the poor, while the lower tax burden on low-income households increases their disposable income. Both effects work to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, thus decreasing relative poverty."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_224.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "14 which policy is not designed to correct a market failure?\na government provision of healthcare\nb price controls on large firms\nc regulations to limit smoke pollution\nd introducing import quotas", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nIntroducing import quotas is a form of trade protectionism, not a policy designed to correct a market failure. The primary objective of an import quota is to shield domestic producers from foreign competition by restricting the quantity of a specific good that can be imported. Rather than correcting an existing market failure, such a policy typically introduces market distortions. By limiting supply, quotas raise the domestic price of the good, reduce consumer surplus, and create a deadweight loss, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. This moves the market away from the efficient outcome that would be achieved under free trade.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. government provision of healthcare**\nThis policy is designed to correct market failures associated with healthcare. Healthcare is often considered a **merit good**, a good that generates positive externalities (e.g., a healthier population reduces the spread of disease and increases productivity) and is likely to be under-consumed if left to the free market. Individuals may not fully perceive the long-term benefits or may be unable to afford care. Government provision or subsidisation aims to increase consumption to the socially optimal level, thereby correcting for this under-provision and addressing the positive externalities.\n\n**B. price controls on large firms**\nThis policy is intended to correct the market failure caused by **monopoly or oligopoly power**. Large firms with significant market power can set prices well above their marginal cost, leading to an allocatively inefficient outcome, a reduction in consumer welfare, and a deadweight loss to society. Price controls, such as price ceilings, are a form of regulation used to limit the ability of these firms to exploit their market power, with the goal of bringing prices closer to a competitive level and improving allocative efficiency.\n\n**C. regulations to limit smoke pollution**\nThis policy directly addresses the market failure of **negative externalities**. Smoke pollution is a classic example of a negative externality of production, where the social cost of an economic activity (e.g., manufacturing) exceeds the private cost borne by the producer. In an unregulated market, this leads to an overproduction of the good and an excessive level of pollution. Regulations, such as emission standards or pollution caps, force firms to internalise the external costs, aiming to reduce production and pollution to the socially optimal level."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_225.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "15 to control the cost of living, governments have sometimes imposed a maximum price on certain\ngoods that is below the free market price.\nwhat is often an undesirable side effect of such a policy?\na accelerating general inflation\nb_anincrease in profits above normal profits\nc_anincrease in the stocks of unsold goods held by firms\nd shortages of the good", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA maximum price, also known as a price ceiling, is a government-imposed price control that sets the highest price that can be charged for a good or service. For this policy to be effective or \"binding,\" it must be set below the free-market equilibrium price.\n\nAt this lower, legally-mandated price, the law of demand dictates that the quantity demanded for the good will increase, as consumers are willing and able to purchase more at a lower price. Conversely, the law of supply indicates that the quantity supplied by producers will decrease. This is because the lower price reduces producers' revenue and profit margins, diminishing their incentive and ability to supply the good.\n\nThe result is a situation where the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied (Qd > Qs). This gap is defined as a shortage or excess demand. Consumers want to buy more of the good than firms are willing to sell at the controlled price, leading to an undesirable side effect of scarcity, queues, and potential for black markets.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: accelerating general inflation**\nA price ceiling is a microeconomic policy tool applied to a specific market, often with the goal of curbing price increases for that particular good (e.g., rent control, price caps on fuel). It is intended to combat inflation in a specific sector, not cause it. General inflation is a macroeconomic phenomenon, representing a sustained increase in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy. A price ceiling on a few goods is highly unlikely to accelerate economy-wide inflation.\n\n**B: an increase in profits above normal profits**\nImposing a maximum price below the market equilibrium forces firms to sell their product for less than they otherwise would. This directly reduces the revenue per unit sold. Lower revenue, assuming costs remain the same, leads to a reduction in profit margins. Therefore, a price ceiling makes it more difficult for firms to earn profits, and it certainly does not lead to an increase in profits above the normal level (supernormal profits).\n\n**C: an increase in the stocks of unsold goods held by firms**\nAn increase in the stocks of unsold goods is known as a surplus or excess supply. A surplus occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded (Qs > Qd).

Such decisions involve substantial financial outlay and are based on firms' expectations of future demand and profitability. If an increase in national income is perceived as permanent, it signals a long-term, sustained rise in aggregate demand. This gives firms the confidence that the higher demand for their products will persist, making it profitable to expand their productive capacity by investing in new capital. This relationship is central to the accelerator theory of investment, which posits that the level of net investment is determined by the rate of change of national income. A permanent change provides the necessary justification for long-term capital expenditure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. when firms have spare production capacity**\nIf firms have spare (or excess) production capacity, it means their existing capital stock is not being fully utilised. In this situation, an increase in demand resulting from a rise in national income can be met by simply using the idle machinery and equipment more intensively. Firms will not need to purchase new capital goods until this spare capacity is fully exhausted. Therefore, the existence of spare capacity weakens, or at least delays, the inducement to invest following a rise in national income.\n\n**B. when firms use labour-intensive production**\nInvestment is defined as spending on capital goods. In firms that use labour-intensive production methods, output is increased primarily by employing more labour rather than by acquiring more machinery. While some complementary capital may be needed, the main response to a sustained increase in demand will be to hire more workers. The link between a rise in national income and *capital* investment is therefore weaker than in capital-intensive industries, where an increase in output directly requires more machines.\n\n**D. when the increase in income is regarded as temporary**\nFirms will not undertake significant and costly investment in new capital goods if they believe the rise in demand is only temporary. Investment projects have long lifespans, and their profitability depends on sustained future revenues. If the increase in demand is expected to be short-lived, firms will find it unprofitable to expand capacity that may soon become redundant. Instead, they are more likely to meet the temporary surge in demand by running down inventories, increasing overtime for the existing workforce, or hiring temporary workers."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_227.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "17. what is a function of money?\na_ lt can be divided into small units.\nbit can be easily carried.\nc_ itis a standard of deferred payment.\nd_itis widely accepted.", "Chapter": 26, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nA key function of money is to serve as a standard of deferred payment. This means that money provides a standard measure for making payments that are due at a future date. It allows for the creation of debt and credit, as the value of future obligations (such as loan repayments or salary payments) can be expressed and settled in monetary terms. This function is essential for the smooth operation of modern economies, facilitating borrowing, lending, and investment. It is one of the four primary functions of money, along with being a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It can be divided into small units.**\nThis describes divisibility, which is a *characteristic* or *property* of good money, not one of its fundamental economic functions. Divisibility means that money can be broken down into smaller denominations to facilitate transactions of varying values. For example, a dollar can be divided into cents. While essential for practical use, it is a feature that enables money to perform its functions effectively, rather than being a function itself.\n\n**B. It can be easily carried.**\nThis describes portability, which is another *characteristic* of good money, not a function. Portability ensures that money can be conveniently transported and transferred between individuals. Modern forms of money like currency notes and digital funds are highly portable.

It is widely accepted.**\nThis describes general acceptability, which is a crucial *characteristic* of money. For any item to serve as money, it must be widely accepted by people in exchange for goods and services. This confidence is what underpins its role as a medium of exchange.

The scenario describes such a structural shift: the move to working from home permanently reduces demand for ancillary services in city centres, such as coffee shops and retailers.\n\nConsequently, workers in these sectors (e.g., baristas, retail staff) become unemployed. Their job losses are not due to a temporary downturn in the economy (cyclical unemployment) or the normal process of changing jobs (frictional unemployment). Instead, their skills are no longer in demand in their previous industries and locations. These workers are structurally unemployed and may need to retrain or relocate to find work in growing sectors of the economy. Therefore, a permanent shift to working from home would most likely lead to an increase in structural unemployment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: Frictional unemployment will decrease.**\nFrictional unemployment is the short-term unemployment experienced by individuals who are in the process of moving between jobs. A major economic disruption, such as the one described, would likely lead to more people searching for jobs simultaneously, potentially lengthening the search process. It would not reduce the 'friction' in the labour market; if anything, the large-scale displacement of workers would likely increase frictional unemployment in the short term, not decrease it.\n\n**B: The geographical mobility of labour will increase.**\nGeographical mobility of labour refers to the ability and willingness of workers to move to different locations to take up jobs. While it is true that a widespread shift to remote work could increase the *effective* geographical mobility of labour (as a worker could take a job with a company in another city without physically moving), this is a broader consequence of the work-from-home trend itself, not the most direct result of the *closure of businesses*. The question focuses on the result of this trend, which includes business closures and the subsequent job losses. The most direct impact of these closures on the labour market is the creation of a specific type of unemployment.\n\n**D: Voluntary unemployment will increase.**\nVoluntary unemployment occurs when individuals choose not to accept a job at the prevailing wage rate. The scenario describes a situation where workers lose their jobs due to business closures, which is a form of *involuntary* unemployment.

Increasing taxes on the labour force would reduce the disposable income of workers, potentially lowering consumption and aggregate demand. Furthermore, higher taxes could create a disincentive to work, possibly shrinking the labour supply further. This policy does not aim to boost production or growth; it is a measure to reallocate resources to support a growing retired population, and it may even have a negative impact on economic growth."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_230.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "20 other things remaining equal, what will reduce the level of national income in an economy?\na _afall in planned savings\nba fall in the marginal propensity to import\nc_anincrease in the average propensity to consume\nd  areduction in the level of defence expenditure", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA reduction in the level of defence expenditure will reduce the level of national income. Defence expenditure is a component of government spending (G), which is a key component of aggregate demand (AD). The aggregate demand in an economy is calculated as AD = C + I + G + (X - M). A reduction in defence spending leads to a direct decrease in G, thereby reducing the overall level of aggregate demand. This initial decrease in spending will have a multiplied effect on the economy, causing a larger final reduction in the equilibrium level of national income. This is because the initial fall in government spending reduces the income of firms and households, leading to subsequent rounds of reduced consumption and investment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a fall in planned savings**\nA fall in planned savings would lead to an increase, not a reduction, in the level of national income. Savings are a leakage from the circular flow of income. When households decide to save less of their income, they are, by definition, choosing to consume more (since Income = Consumption + Savings). An increase in consumption (C) raises aggregate demand (AD), which stimulates economic activity and leads to a higher equilibrium level of national income.\n\n**B. a fall in the marginal propensity to import (MPM)**\nA fall in the marginal propensity to import (MPM) would increase the level of national income. The MPM represents the proportion of any additional income that is spent on imported goods and services. Imports (M) are a leakage from the circular flow of income. A lower MPM means that for any given increase in income, less is spent on foreign goods and more is spent on domestic goods. This strengthens the multiplier effect (k = 1 / (sum of marginal propensities to withdraw)). A larger multiplier means that any initial injection of spending will lead to a larger final increase in national income. Therefore, a fall in the MPM would tend to raise, not reduce, national income.\n\n**C. an increase in the average propensity to consume (APC)**\nAn increase in the average propensity to consume (APC) would lead to an increase in national income. The APC is the proportion of total income that is spent on consumption (C/Y). If the APC increases, it means that at any given level of national income, a larger fraction is being consumed. This directly increases the consumption component (C) of aggregate demand (AD). An increase in aggregate demand leads to a higher equilibrium level of national income through the multiplier process."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_231.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "21 what, according to the accelerator principle, will cause the level of investment to fall?\na adecrease in confidence\nb= adecrease in the rate of growth of national income\nc_anincrease in the price of capital equipment\nd_anincrease in the rate of interest", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe accelerator principle posits a direct relationship between the level of net investment and the rate of change of national income (or aggregate demand). Investment is undertaken by firms to increase their capital stock, which is the machinery, equipment, and buildings used to produce goods and services.\n\nAccording to this principle, for net investment to be positive, national income must be growing. Firms invest to expand their productive capacity to meet the anticipated increase in demand. The key insight of the accelerator is that the *level* of investment depends not on the *level* of national income, but on its *rate of growth*.\n\nIf the rate of growth of national income slows down (e.g., from 5% per year to 2% per year), national income is still increasing, but at a slower pace. Consequently, firms will need less additional capital than before to meet this smaller increase in demand. As a result, the level of net investment will fall. If the growth rate of national income becomes zero or negative, net investment will fall to zero or become negative (disinvestment), as firms will not need to expand capacity and may even reduce it.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a decrease in confidence**\nWhile a decrease in business confidence (what Keynes termed \"animal spirits\") will certainly cause a fall in the level of investment, this is not explained by the accelerator principle. A fall in confidence makes firms more pessimistic about future profitability and less willing to commit to new capital projects, regardless of the current rate of growth in national income. The accelerator model specifically isolates the effect of changes in national income on investment, assuming other factors like confidence are constant.\n\n**C: an increase in the price of capital equipment**\nAn increase in the price of capital equipment raises the cost of investment. This would make some investment projects less profitable or unprofitable, leading to a decrease in the overall level of investment. This effect is related to the Marginal Efficiency of Capital (MEC) theory, which compares the expected rate of return from an investment to the cost of capital. However, the accelerator principle, in its basic form, does not focus on the price of capital; it focuses on the level of investment induced by changes in output.\n\n**D: an increase in the rate of interest**\nAn increase in the rate of interest is a primary determinant of investment, but its effect is distinct from the accelerator principle. A higher interest rate increases the cost of borrowing funds to finance investment or raises the opportunity cost of using retained profits for investment. In either case, it makes investment less attractive and leads to a lower level of investment. This relationship is a cornerstone of standard investment theory, but the accelerator principle specifically describes investment that is induced by growth in national income, not by changes in the interest rate."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_232.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w23_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "22 what is measured on the vertical axis of the phillips curve?\na the rate of change of real wages\nb_ the rate of change of take-home pay\nc the rate of inflation\nd the rate of interest", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe modern Phillips curve depicts the short-run inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. The vertical axis of the Phillips curve graph measures the rate of inflation, typically as an annual percentage change in a price index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The horizontal axis measures the unemployment rate. The downward-sloping shape of the short-run Phillips curve suggests that policymakers face a trade-off: to achieve a lower rate of unemployment, the economy may have to tolerate a higher rate of inflation, and conversely, policies aimed at reducing inflation may lead to a temporary increase in unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: the rate of change of real wages**\n\nThis is incorrect. The original study by A.W. Phillips in 1958 did examine the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of *nominal* (or money) wages. However, the model was later modified by economists like Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow to show the link between unemployment and price inflation, as this relationship was considered more relevant for macroeconomic policy. The rate of change of *real* wages (which is the change in nominal wages adjusted for inflation) is a measure of the change in purchasing power and is not the variable plotted on the vertical axis of either the original or the modern Phillips curve.\n\n**B: the rate of change of take-home pay**\n\nThis is incorrect. Take-home pay, or disposable income, is the income remaining after taxes and other mandatory deductions have been subtracted from gross wages. While related to wage levels, it is also directly affected by changes in fiscal policy, such as alterations in income tax rates. The Phillips curve is a macroeconomic model that isolates the relationship between unemployment and the general rate of inflation (or wage inflation), not the post-tax income of individuals.\n\n**D: the rate of interest**\n\nThis is incorrect. The rate of interest is a crucial macroeconomic variable, representing the cost of borrowing. However, it is not measured on either axis of the Phillips curve. The relationship between the interest rate and other variables, such as national income or the quantity of money, is shown in different economic models like the IS-LM framework or the money market diagram.

For instance, between 2013 and 2016, both FDI and GDP growth followed a general downward trend, suggesting a possible positive correlation. However, in the period from 2012 to 2013, FDI inflows increased significantly (from approx. 1.0% to 2.25% of GDP), while the GDP growth rate actually decreased (from approx. 2.2% to 2.0%), indicating an inverse relationship. This inconsistency, where the variables sometimes move in the same direction and at other times in opposite directions, demonstrates a weak overall correlation.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect because it posits a consistent positive relationship that is not supported by the data. A clear counterexample is the period from 2012 to 2013. During this time, FDI as a percentage of GDP rose sharply, but this was accompanied by a slight fall in the GDP growth rate, not an improvement. This directly contradicts the claim that increases in FDI are in line with improvements in GDP growth.\n\n**C:** This statement is falsified by the data. It suggests that falling FDI is associated with stable GDP growth. However, during the period of the sharpest decline in FDI, from 2008 to 2010, GDP growth was highly volatile, not stable. It plummeted from approximately 3.0% to -1.5% and then rebounded to 3.0%. Similarly, the decline in FDI from 2013 to 2016 was accompanied by a declining, and therefore unstable, GDP growth rate.\n\n**D:** This statement is incorrect. The diagram shows that in 2009, South Africa experienced negative GDP growth of approximately -1.5%. However, the FDI graph shows that during that same period, there were still significant positive inflows of FDI, amounting to roughly 2.5% of GDP.

It encompasses not only increases in income but also enhancements in the quality of life. This includes factors such as improved health outcomes (e.g., higher life expectancy), better educational attainment (e.g., higher literacy rates and school enrolment), greater access to essential goods and services, and a general increase in living standards. Therefore, an improvement in the average citizen's quality of life is the most direct and comprehensive indicator that genuine economic development has occurred, as it reflects the ultimate goal of economic progress.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. an appreciation in the country's currency**\nA currency appreciation, an increase in the value of a currency relative to others, is not a reliable indicator of economic development. While it can be a sign of a strong economy attracting foreign investment, it can also be caused by factors such as high interest rates or speculation, which may not translate into broad-based improvements in living standards. Furthermore, a strong currency can be detrimental to development by making a country's exports more expensive and less competitive, potentially leading to job losses in key industries.\n\n**C. an improvement in the country's trade balance**\nAn improvement in the trade balance (i.e., a smaller deficit or a larger surplus) is not a definitive sign of economic development. A country could achieve a trade surplus by suppressing domestic demand and consumption, which would lower the quality of life for its citizens. Conversely, a developing country may run a trade deficit by importing essential capital goods and technology needed for long-term investment and industrialisation.

While economic growth is often a necessary condition for economic development, it is not sufficient. Growth can occur without development if its benefits are not widely distributed. For instance, real GDP could rise due to increased production in a specific sector (e.g., oil extraction) that benefits only a small elite, while inequality worsens and there are no corresponding improvements in public services like health and education for the general population.

While governments typically aim for a low and stable rate of *inflation* (a slow rise in prices) rather than *deflation* (a fall in prices), the control of the general price level is a fundamental macroeconomic objective. Among the given choices, this is the only one that represents a macroeconomic aim rather than a policy tool.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: an increase in monopoly regulation**\n\nThis is a **microeconomic policy**, not a macroeconomic aim. Monopoly regulation targets specific firms or markets to promote competition, prevent consumer exploitation, and improve allocative efficiency.

The primary sector involves the extraction and harvesting of raw materials, such as agriculture, fishing, and mining. In low-income countries, a large proportion of the population is employed in this sector, and it constitutes a significant share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Economic development is often associated with a structural shift from the primary to the secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (services) sectors.\n*   **Gini coefficient value:** This is typically **high**. The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of income or wealth distribution, with a value of 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. Low-income economies often exhibit significant income inequality due to factors such as a concentration of land and capital ownership, a large informal sector, and weak or regressive tax systems and social safety nets.

A key aspect of this mandate is providing short-term financial assistance to member countries that are experiencing balance of payments problems. A balance of payments deficit occurs when a country's total payments to foreign countries exceed its total receipts from them. This can lead to a depletion of a country's foreign currency reserves, potentially causing a currency crisis and economic instability. The IMF provides loans to help these countries manage their external debt, stabilize their currencies, and restore conditions for sustainable economic growth. These loans are typically conditional on the borrowing country implementing specific economic reforms (structural adjustment policies) designed to address the root causes of their financial difficulties.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. to advise countries that are experiencing trade disagreements**\nThis is the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO), not the IMF. The WTO provides a forum for negotiating trade agreements and has a formal dispute settlement mechanism to resolve trade disagreements between member countries. While the IMF may provide economic advice that touches on trade policy as part of its surveillance or lending programmes, its primary mandate is financial and monetary stability, not the adjudication of trade disputes.\n\n**B. to help charities providing emergency assistance to countries in need**\nThe IMF is an intergovernmental financial institution that deals directly with the governments and central banks of its member countries. It does not provide funding to private charities or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

At this lower world price `P_W`, the quantity demanded by domestic consumers is determined by the intersection of the price line `P_W` and the domestic demand curve `D_domestic`, which is `Q_4`. Simultaneously, the quantity supplied by domestic producers is determined by the intersection of the price line `P_W` and the domestic supply curve `S_domestic`, which is `Q_1`. Imports are the difference between the total quantity demanded and the quantity supplied by domestic producers. Therefore, the quantity of imports after the removal of the tariff is the total demand `Q_4` minus the domestic supply `Q_1`, which is represented by the range `Q_1Q_4`.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: `Q_1Q_2`\n\nThis range represents the decrease in the quantity supplied by domestic producers as a result of the tariff removal. Before the tariff was removed, at price `P_W + T`, domestic firms supplied `Q_2`. After the removal, at the lower price `P_W`, they supply `Q_1`. The difference, `Q_2 - Q_1`, is the contraction in domestic output, not the total volume of imports.\n\n#### C: `Q_2Q_3`\n\nThis range represents the quantity of imports *before* the tariff was removed.

Even with the advantages of low wages and low-cost land, a lack of reliable infrastructure can render a manufacturing investment unprofitable and unfeasible.\n\n*   **Transport Infrastructure:** Manufacturing requires the movement of raw materials to the factory and finished goods to markets. Poor roads, inefficient ports, and inadequate railways increase transportation costs and lead times, eroding the cost advantages of cheap labour and land.\n*   **Energy Infrastructure:** Manufacturing processes are often energy-intensive. An unreliable electricity supply, characterised by frequent power outages, can halt production, damage machinery, and necessitate costly investments in private generators.\n*   **Communication Infrastructure:** Modern manufacturing relies on sophisticated logistics and supply chain management, which require reliable telecommunications and internet services for coordination with suppliers, distributors, and headquarters.\n\nIn essence, the additional operational costs, delays, and risks associated with poor infrastructure can easily outweigh the savings from lower factor costs (labour and land), thus deterring foreign investment in manufacturing.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. if the country creates genuine independence for their central bank**\n\nThis circumstance would typically *attract*, not deter, foreign investment. An independent central bank is associated with greater macroeconomic stability. It can pursue monetary policy, such as controlling inflation, without direct political interference. This leads to a more predictable economic environment, lower inflation risk, and greater currency stability, all of which reduce the risks for foreign investors and make the country a more attractive destination for investment.\n\n**B. if the country embarks on a programme of privatisation**\n\nA programme of privatisation generally *encourages* foreign investment. Privatisation involves transferring state-owned assets to the private sector. This can create new investment opportunities for foreign firms, either through direct acquisition of former state enterprises or by opening up previously closed sectors to competition. It also signals a government's commitment to market-oriented reforms, which is viewed favourably by international investors.\n\n**D. if the country permits repatriation of profits**\n\nThe ability to repatriate profits is a fundamental requirement for foreign investors. Repatriation is the process of converting foreign currency earnings back into the home currency of the investing company. If a country restricts or prohibits the repatriation of profits, it creates a significant disincentive for foreign direct investment, as firms would be unable to realise the returns on their investment.

Mathematically, it is the slope (or gradient) of the total utility curve.\n\nAt point C, the total utility curve reaches its maximum point. At the peak of any curve, the slope of the tangent line is zero. Since the slope of the total utility curve represents marginal utility, it follows that marginal utility is equal to zero at the point where total utility is maximized. This is also known as the point of satiation, beyond which consuming more of the good would lead to a decrease in total utility.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** At point A, the total utility curve is upward sloping, indicating a positive gradient. Therefore, marginal utility is positive. This means that consuming an additional unit of the good at this stage increases the consumer's total utility. The curve at this point is also convex, suggesting that marginal utility is not only positive but also increasing.\n\n*   **B:** At point B, the total utility curve continues to slope upwards, meaning its gradient is still positive. Consequently, marginal utility is positive, although it is likely diminishing (as indicated by the curve becoming less steep, i.e., concave, after the inflection point which occurs between A and B). This aligns with the law of diminishing marginal utility, where each additional unit consumed provides less additional utility than the previous one, but total utility still increases.\n\n*   **D:** At point D, the total utility curve is downward sloping, which signifies a negative gradient. Therefore, marginal utility is negative. This implies that consuming additional units beyond the satiation point (C) actually reduces the consumer's total satisfaction, leading to disutility. It is important to note that at point D, it is the *total* utility that has fallen to zero, not the *marginal* utility."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_242.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "2 what is a characteristic of an indifference curve?\na it will remain concave to the origin of the diagram.\nb it will remain convex to the origin of the diagram.\nc_ it can intersect other indifference curves at any point.\nd_ the lower the indifference curve, the greater the satisfaction attainable.", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\nAn indifference curve is typically convex to the origin. This shape reflects the principle of the diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS). The MRS is the rate at which a consumer is willing to give up a quantity of one good (e.g., good Y) to obtain one additional unit of another good (e.g., good X), while maintaining the same level of overall satisfaction (utility).\n\nAs a consumer moves down along an indifference curve, they possess more of good X and less of good Y. Due to the law of diminishing marginal utility, the additional satisfaction gained from each new unit of good X decreases, while the satisfaction lost from each given-up unit of good Y increases. Consequently, the consumer is willing to sacrifice progressively fewer units of the now-scarcer good Y to obtain an additional unit of the more abundant good X. This diminishing trade-off results in the curve's slope becoming flatter as one moves from left to right, creating the characteristic convex (bowed inward) shape.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n*   **A. It will remain concave to the origin of the diagram.**\n    A curve that is concave to the origin would bow outwards. This would imply an *increasing* marginal rate of substitution. An increasing MRS would mean that as a consumer acquired more of good X, they would be willing to give up progressively *more* of good Y to get an additional unit of X. This contradicts the standard assumption of diminishing marginal utility and is not a characteristic of typical indifference curves.\n\n*   **C. It can intersect other indifference curves at any point.**\n    A fundamental property of indifference curves is that they can never intersect. Each indifference curve represents a distinct and constant level of utility. If two curves were to intersect, the point of intersection would represent a single combination of goods that simultaneously provides two different levels of satisfaction. This is a logical impossibility and violates the assumption of transitivity in consumer preferences (i.e., if bundle A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C, then A must be preferred to C).\n\n*   **D. The lower the indifference curve, the greater the satisfaction attainable.**\n    This statement is incorrect. It reverses the relationship between the position of an indifference curve and the level of satisfaction. Based on the \"non-satiation\" assumption (more is preferred to less), a higher indifference curve (one further from the origin) represents a greater level of satisfaction. This is because any point on a higher curve corresponds to a bundle containing more of at least one good, and no less of the other, compared to a point on a lower curve.

In economics, a cost is a sacrifice or negative outcome resulting from a decision. While the legal safety standards for vehicles would not change, the overall *level* of safety experienced by commuters would decrease. Motorcycles offer significantly less physical protection to the rider than cars, which have features like a steel frame, airbags, and seatbelts. An increase in the number of motorcycles on the road would statistically lead to a higher number of severe injuries and fatalities in the event of accidents. This increased risk to human life and health is a significant cost that must be weighed against the potential benefits.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. reduced travel times**\n\nThis is incorrect because reduced travel times are a primary **benefit**, not a cost, of easing traffic congestion. If more people switch to motorcycles, which take up less space and can maneuver more easily through traffic, overall congestion would likely decrease. This would allow all road users, including those still in cars, to reach their destinations faster. A saving in time is a positive economic outcome.\n\n**B. reduced car emissions**\n\nThis is incorrect as it represents a **benefit**, specifically a positive externality or social benefit. With 10% of drivers switching from cars to motorcycles, there would be fewer cars on the road. This would lead to a direct reduction in the total volume of emissions produced by cars, contributing to better air quality and reducing environmental damage. This is a positive outcome, not a cost.\n\n**D. reduced traffic queues**\n\nThis is incorrect because, similar to reduced travel times, it is a significant **benefit** of the proposed change. Reduced traffic queues are a direct indicator of decreased traffic congestion.

Increasing returns to scale occur when a given percentage increase in all factors of production (inputs) leads to a larger percentage increase in output. This increased efficiency means that the cost per unit of output (the average cost) decreases as the firm expands its scale of production. Common sources of economies of scale include technical economies (e.g., use of more specialised and efficient machinery), financial economies (e.g., access to cheaper finance), and managerial economies (e.g., employing specialist managers).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in total fixed cost**\nThis is incorrect because the concept of fixed costs is specific to the short run, a period where at least one factor of production is fixed. The LRAC curve depicts the long run, a timeframe in which all factors of production are variable. Therefore, there are no fixed costs in the long-run analysis. A change in technology or input prices would shift the entire LRAC curve, rather than cause a movement along it.\n\n**C. internal diseconomies of scale**\nInternal diseconomies of scale (or decreasing returns to scale) occur when the long-run average cost of production increases as output increases. This is represented by the upward-sloping portion of the LRAC curve, which would be the section *after* point Y. Diseconomies of scale typically arise from challenges in managing and coordinating a very large-scale operation, leading to inefficiencies and rising per-unit costs.

This integration affects the firm's costs of production but not the market demand for its final product.\n\n*   **Effect on Average Cost (AC):** The problem states that the takeover makes component parts cheaper for Firm X. Component parts are a key input in the production process. A reduction in the price of inputs lowers the firm's total cost of production for any given quantity of output. Consequently, the average cost (Total Cost / Quantity) also decreases. On the diagram, a decrease in average cost is shown by a downward shift of the AC curve. Therefore, the original average cost curve, AC\u2081, shifts down to AC\u2082.\n\n*   **Effect on Average Revenue (AR):** The average revenue curve is also the firm's demand curve. It reflects the relationship between the price of the product and the quantity demanded by consumers. The takeover of a component supplier is a supply-side change that affects the firm's internal cost structure. It does not directly influence the external factors that determine market demand, such as consumer tastes, incomes, or the prices of substitute and complementary goods. Therefore, the demand for Firm X's electronic goods, and hence its average revenue curve, remains unchanged at its original position, AR\u2081.\n\nCombining these two effects, the new average cost curve is AC\u2082 and the new average revenue curve is AR\u2081.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **A: AC\u2081, AR\u2083:** This option is incorrect. It suggests that average costs remain unchanged (AC\u2081) and average revenue increases (AR\u2083). Costs would decrease due to cheaper components, so AC\u2081 is wrong.

This concept, part of behavioural theories of the firm, is particularly relevant for small, family-owned businesses like LMN Ltd. The scenario explicitly states that the owners aim for a \"minimum acceptable level of performance.\" This wording directly aligns with the principle of satisficing.

The description of LMN Ltd's objective as achieving a \"minimum acceptable level of performance\" is contrary to the principle of maximisation. A maximising firm would always seek to increase profits further if possible, whereas LMN Ltd is content with reaching a predetermined, satisfactory threshold.\n\n**C - Revenue Maximising:**\nRevenue maximisation is an objective where a firm aims to maximise its total revenue, which occurs at the output level where marginal revenue is zero (MR=0). This is often pursued to increase a firm's size or market share, sometimes at the expense of profitability.

The average cost at this point is $80.\n\nWhen the firm makes a permanent decision to increase output to 3000 computers per week, it will adjust its scale to the new optimal level. To find the new long-run average cost, we look at the LRAC curve at an output of 3000. The diagram shows that the LRAC of producing 3000 computers is $40. This corresponds to the minimum point of a new, larger-scale plant represented by SRAC\u2082.\n\nThe change in the average cost is the difference between the initial long-run average cost and the new long-run average cost:\nInitial Average Cost (at 2000 units) = $80\nNew Long-Run Average Cost (at 3000 units) = $40\nChange in Average Cost = $80 - $40 = $40.\nTherefore, the average cost decreases by $40.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: $20**\nThis value represents the change in average cost in the *short run*.

The absence of significant barriers to entry is a key feature that it shares with perfect competition. This means that new firms can easily enter the market if they are attracted by the prospect of supernormal profits. In the long run, this ease of entry ensures that any supernormal profits are competed away, and firms will only earn normal profits. Conversely, if firms are making losses, some will exit the market, which continues until the remaining firms are making normal profits.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **B: identical products:** This is a characteristic of perfect competition, not monopolistic competition. The \"monopolistic\" aspect of monopolistic competition arises precisely because firms sell differentiated products. These products are close substitutes but are not identical, differing in aspects like branding, quality, design, or location. This differentiation gives each firm a degree of market power.\n\n*   **C: price takers:** Firms that are price takers must accept the prevailing market price. This is a feature of perfect competition, where products are identical and each firm is too small to influence the market. In contrast, firms in monopolistic competition are price makers (or price searchers). Due to product differentiation, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve and has some control over the price it charges.\n\n*   **D: small number of buyers and sellers:** A small number of sellers is the defining characteristic of an oligopoly. In an oligopoly, firms are interdependent and must consider the strategic reactions of their rivals. Monopolistic competition, however, features a *large* number of sellers, each with a relatively small market share.

In large firms, particularly public limited companies, the owners (the principals, i.e., shareholders) delegate the day-to-day running of the company to professional managers (the agents). This separation creates a potential conflict of interest. The principals' primary objective is typically profit maximisation to increase their dividends and the value of their shares. However, the agents may have different objectives, such as maximising their own salaries, benefits, job security, or the size of the firm ('empire building'), which do not necessarily align with profit maximisation. This misalignment of incentives, where the agent may act in their own self-interest rather than the best interest of the principal, is the essence of the principal-agent problem.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: contestable markets**\nA contestable market is defined by low barriers to entry and exit, which means that the threat of new competition forces incumbent firms to behave competitively. This concept relates to market structure and the level of competition *between* firms. The separation of ownership and control, however, is an issue of internal firm governance concerning the relationship *within* a firm. The structure of a firm's ownership and management does not cause a market to be contestable, nor does market contestability cause this separation.\n\n**B: diseconomies of scale**\nDiseconomies of scale occur when a firm's long-run average costs increase as its output expands beyond a certain point. This is typically caused by managerial and coordination issues that arise from excessive size, such as communication breakdowns, duplication of effort, and loss of employee morale. While both the separation of ownership and control and diseconomies of scale are often associated with large firms, the former is not the cause of the latter. Diseconomies of scale are an operational issue related to the technical challenges of managing large-scale production, not a governance issue stemming from the specific relationship between owners and managers.\n\n**D: prisoner's dilemma**\nThe prisoner's dilemma is a concept from game theory that describes a situation where two rational parties, acting in their own self-interest, do not achieve the optimal outcome. It is commonly used to model the strategic interdependence of firms in an oligopoly, explaining why collusion can be difficult to maintain. This concept analyses the behaviour *between* competing firms, whereas the separation of ownership and control deals with the relationship *within* a single firm.

While both are government interventions aimed at influencing economic outcomes, they operate through different mechanisms. Taxation works indirectly by altering market incentives. By imposing a tax on cigarettes, the government increases their price, which is intended to reduce the quantity demanded. This is a market-based policy because it still allows individuals the choice to purchase cigarettes, but makes that choice more expensive.\n\nRegulation, in contrast, involves direct government control over an activity through rules, laws, or standards. It typically involves commands and controls, such as prohibiting an action, mandating a certain behaviour, or requiring a license to operate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a ban on cocaine consumption:** A ban is a direct prohibition on an activity.

Private marginal costs increase.**\n\nA government subsidy paid to the producers of a good or service, such as a rural school bus service, acts as a payment that reduces the firm's cost of production for each unit supplied. The firm's supply curve is determined by its private marginal cost (MPC) of production. The subsidy effectively shifts this supply curve downwards (or to the right), as the cost to the firm of supplying each additional journey is lower.\n\nWhen the government removes this subsidy, this effect is reversed. The firm no longer receives the payment and must now bear the full cost of providing each additional unit of the service. Consequently, the private marginal cost of production increases for every level of output. This is represented graphically as an upward (or leftward) shift of the supply curve.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Deadweight loss decreases.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A rural school bus service is likely considered a merit good that generates positive externalities (e.g., ensuring access to education for all children, reducing traffic congestion from parents driving). In the presence of positive externalities, the free market equilibrium quantity is less than the socially optimal quantity, resulting in a deadweight loss (DWL) of welfare. A subsidy is a corrective measure designed to increase consumption towards the socially optimal level, thereby *reducing* this deadweight loss. Removing the subsidy would cause the quantity supplied and consumed to fall, moving the market further away from the social optimum and thus *increasing* the deadweight loss.\n\n**C. Private marginal benefit decreases.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The private marginal benefit (MPB) reflects the satisfaction or utility that consumers (in this case, families using the bus service) receive from consuming an additional unit of the service. It is represented by the demand curve. The removal of a subsidy paid to producers affects the costs of supply, not the inherent value or benefit that consumers place on the service. The demand curve and the private marginal benefit remain unchanged.\n\n**D. Social marginal costs decrease.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The social marginal cost (SMC) represents the total cost to society of producing one more unit of a good or service. This includes the private costs of the producer (labour, fuel, vehicle maintenance) and any external costs imposed on third parties. A subsidy is a transfer payment from the government to the producer. It alters who bears the private cost but does not change the real resource cost to society of providing the bus service.

In the labour market, assuming the demand for labour remains constant, a rightward shift in the supply curve for labour will lead to a surplus of workers at the original equilibrium wage rate. This surplus creates downward pressure on wages, as there is greater competition among workers for available jobs. Consequently, the average wage rate will either grow more slowly, stagnate, or fall. The pattern shown in the graph, where wage growth decelerates from positive to negative, is consistent with a significant increase in the supply of labour.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in the supply of labour**\nA decrease in the supply of labour, ceteris paribus, would mean that there are fewer workers available for employers to hire. This would increase competition among firms for a smaller pool of labour, leading to upward pressure on wages. Firms would need to offer higher wages to attract and retain the necessary employees. This would result in an increase, not a decrease, in the growth of average earnings, which is the opposite of the trend depicted.\n\n**B. a decrease in the interest rate**\nA decrease in the interest rate is an expansionary monetary policy tool. It lowers the cost of borrowing for firms and consumers, stimulating investment and consumption, which in turn increases aggregate demand. To meet this higher demand for goods and services, firms would increase their demand for labour. An increase in the demand for labour, with supply held constant, would bid up the price of labour, leading to higher average wages and a positive or accelerating wage growth rate. This contradicts the observed pattern of falling wage growth.\n\n**C. an increase in productivity**\nAn increase in labour productivity means that each worker produces more output per unit of time. This raises the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labour. Since a firm's demand for labour is derived from the MRP, an increase in productivity will lead to an increase in the demand for labour. As with a decrease in the interest rate, this increased demand would exert upward pressure on wages, causing average earnings to rise. This is inconsistent with the pattern of decelerating and negative wage growth shown."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_254.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "14 the table shows the output of chairs at a factory when different numbers of workers are\nemployed.\nfrumberofwoies | o | 1] 2 [sia] s |\nwhen will diminishing marginal returns to labour set in?\na when the second worker is employed\nb_ when the third worker is employed\nc_ when the fourth worker is employed\nd_ when the fifth worker is employed", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal returns states that as a firm adds successive units of a variable factor of production (in this case, labour) to a fixed factor of production (e.g., machinery or factory space), the marginal product, or the additional output from each new unit of the variable factor, will eventually decrease.\n\nTo identify when diminishing returns set in, we must first calculate the marginal product of labour (MPL) for each additional worker.\n\n*   **Marginal Product of the 1st worker:** 7 - 0 = 7 chairs\n*   **Marginal Product of the 2nd worker:** 17 - 7 = 10 chairs\n*   **Marginal Product of the 3rd worker:** 26 - 17 = 9 chairs\n*   **Marginal Product of the 4th worker:** 34 - 26 = 8 chairs\n*   **Marginal Product of the 5th worker:** 40 - 34 = 6 chairs\n\nInitially, the marginal product increases from 7 to 10. This is a period of increasing marginal returns. However, when the third worker is employed, the marginal product falls from 10 to 9. This is the point at which diminishing marginal returns begin. Therefore, diminishing returns set in with the employment of the third worker.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: when the second worker is employed**\n\nThis is incorrect because employing the second worker leads to *increasing* marginal returns, not diminishing returns. The first worker adds 7 chairs to the total output, while the second worker adds 10 chairs (17 - 7). Since the marginal product increased (from 7 to 10), the factory is experiencing the benefits of specialisation and division of labour, which enhance productivity at this stage.\n\n**C: when the fourth worker is employed**\n\nWhile it is true that the firm is experiencing diminishing marginal returns when the fourth worker is employed (the marginal product is 8, which is less than the 9 produced by the third worker), this is not the point at which they *set in*. The onset of diminishing returns occurred earlier, with the third worker, whose marginal product (9) was the first to be lower than the preceding worker's (10). The question asks for the point where this trend begins.\n\n**D: when the fifth worker is employed**\n\nThis is incorrect because diminishing marginal returns had already begun much earlier. The fifth worker adds 6 chairs to the total output, which is less than the 8 chairs added by the fourth worker. This indicates that the trend of diminishing returns is continuing, but it did not start with the fifth worker.

The MRP curve, therefore, represents the firm's short-run demand curve for labour.\n\n1.  **Initial Equilibrium:** The problem can be analysed by assuming an initial equilibrium point. A logical starting point is the intersection of the initial MRP curve (MRP\u2081) and the initial wage, which we can take as W\u2081. At this point, the firm employs L\u2081 units of labour. This point (L\u2081, W\u2081) is also shown to be on the long-run demand curve (D), reinforcing its status as a stable initial equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Effect of Exogenous Shocks:** The question introduces two changes to this initial situation:\n    *   First, a fall in capital investment per worker reduces the productivity of labour. This causes the MRP curve to shift inwards from MRP\u2081 to MRP\u2082. At any given wage, the firm would now demand less labour than before.\n    *   Second, the wage rate falls from W\u2081 to W\u2082. A lower wage, in isolation, would encourage the firm to hire more labour.\n\n3.  **New Equilibrium:** The firm's new profit-maximising level of employment is found where the new wage (W\u2082) intersects the new MRP curve (MRP\u2082). By tracing the horizontal line from W\u2082 across to the MRP\u2082 curve and then down to the horizontal axis, we find that the new level of labour employed is L\u2082.\n\n4.  **Net Change:** The amount of labour employed changes from the initial level of L\u2081 to the new level of L\u2082. As can be seen from the diagram (where L\u2082 is to the right of L\u2081 on the horizontal axis), this represents an increase in employment. The positive effect of the lower wage on labour demand was stronger than the negative effect of the reduced capital.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: It falls from L\u2083 to L\u2082.**\n    This is incorrect. For employment to fall from L\u2083 to L\u2082, the initial position would have to be at employment level L\u2083. In the diagram, L\u2083 corresponds to a wage of W\u2082 on the *original* MRP\u2081 curve. If the firm was at this point and the MRP curve shifted to MRP\u2082, employment would indeed fall to L\u2082. However, the question states that wages *fall*, implying the initial wage was higher than W\u2082, making (L\u2083, W\u2082) an inconsistent starting point for the scenario described.\n\n*   **C: It increases from L\u2082 to L\u2083.**\n    This is incorrect. The final equilibrium point, after the shift to MRP\u2082 and the wage fall to W\u2082, is at employment level L\u2082. L\u2083 is an employment level associated with the *original* MRP\u2081 curve. Once the fall in capital causes the curve to shift to MRP\u2082, the MRP\u2081 curve is no longer relevant to the firm's hiring decisions. The new equilibrium must be on the new MRP\u2082 curve.\n\n*   **D: It remains the same at L\u2081.**\n    This is incorrect. For employment to remain at L\u2081, the new equilibrium point would have to be where the new wage (W\u2082) intersects the vertical line at L\u2081. However, the diagram shows that at wage W\u2082, the new MRP\u2082 curve dictates an employment level of L\u2082. The firm will only hire L\u2081 labour at wage W\u2081 on the MRP\u2081 curve, or at a higher wage (not shown) on the MRP\u2082 curve."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_256.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "16 which statement about money is correct?\na _ it consists solely of deposits held by commercial banks.\nb it functions as a medium of exchange.\nc_ its monetary value equals its production costs.\nd_ it operates only when there is a double coincidence of wants.", "Chapter": 26, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\nOne of the essential functions of money is to act as a medium of exchange. This means it is a widely accepted intermediary used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods and services. By using money, an economy can move beyond the limitations of a barter system, where transactions require a \"double coincidence of wants.\" As a medium of exchange, money simplifies transactions, promotes economic efficiency, and allows for greater specialisation and division of labour.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: It consists solely of deposits held by commercial banks.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the money supply is composed of more than just commercial bank deposits. A narrow measure of the money supply (M1) typically includes physical currency in circulation (notes and coins) as well as demand deposits (chequing accounts). Broader measures of money (M2, M3) include these components plus other less liquid assets like savings deposits and time deposits. Therefore, stating that money consists *solely* of bank deposits is an inaccurate and incomplete definition.\n\n**C: Its monetary value equals its production costs.**\nThis statement is incorrect for modern economies that use fiat money. Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. Its value is derived from supply and demand, the stability of the issuing government, and the public's faith in its acceptance. The cost to produce a banknote or a coin is significantly less than its face value (monetary value). The concept described, where monetary value is tied to intrinsic value, applies to commodity money (e.g., gold or silver coins), which is not the primary form of money in use today.\n\n**D: It operates only when there is a double coincidence of wants.**\nThis statement is incorrect; in fact, it describes the condition that money is designed to eliminate. A \"double coincidence of wants\" is a requirement for a barter system, where for a transaction to occur, each party must have a good or service that the other party desires. Money solves this problem by acting as a universally accepted medium of exchange. An individual can sell their goods for money and then use that money to buy the goods they desire from someone else, without needing to find a specific trading partner whose wants align perfectly with their own."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_257.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "17 in country x, unemployment is rising at the same time as the number of job vacancies is\nincreasing.\nwhat is the most likely reason for this?\na_ economic growth is falling.\nb_ economic growth is rising.\nc geographical mobility of labour is rising.\nd occupational immobility of labour is rising.", "Chapter": 24, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe scenario describes a situation where there is a simultaneous increase in both unemployment and job vacancies. This points to a mismatch between the supply of and demand for labour, which is the hallmark of structural unemployment.\n\nOccupational immobility of labour occurs when workers lack the necessary skills, qualifications, or experience to move from one type of job to another. If occupational immobility is rising, it means that the skills gap between the unemployed workforce and the requirements of available jobs is widening. For instance, an economy might be shifting from manufacturing to technology-based services. This would lead to redundancies for factory workers (increasing unemployment) while creating new roles for software developers (increasing job vacancies). Because the redundant factory workers do not possess the skills to fill the new tech roles, both unemployment and vacancies rise concurrently. Therefore, rising occupational immobility is the most direct and likely cause of this economic phenomenon.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Economic growth is falling.**\nFalling economic growth, or a recession, leads to cyclical (or demand-deficient) unemployment. In this situation, a decrease in aggregate demand causes firms to reduce production and lay off workers, thus increasing unemployment. However, a key feature of a recession is that firms also reduce hiring and create fewer new positions. This would lead to a *decrease* in the number of job vacancies, which directly contradicts the situation described in the question where job vacancies are increasing.\n\n**B) Economic growth is rising.**\nRising economic growth typically leads to an increase in aggregate demand. In response, firms expand production and seek to hire more workers, which causes the number of job vacancies to increase. This is consistent with one part of the scenario. However, this increased demand for labour should lead to a *decrease* in unemployment, particularly cyclical unemployment. While rising economic growth might be occurring, it does not, by itself, explain why unemployment is also rising. The core issue is not a lack of jobs, but the inability to fill them, which rising growth alone does not address.\n\n**C) Geographical mobility of labour is rising.**\nGeographical mobility refers to the ability of workers to move from one region to another to take up employment. If geographical mobility were *rising*, it would mean that workers are becoming *more* willing and able to relocate to areas where job vacancies exist. This would help to match unemployed individuals with available jobs, thereby *reducing* unemployment, not increasing it. Therefore, rising geographical mobility would alleviate the problem described, not cause it."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_258.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "18 an increase in which variable affecting labour markets is most likely to reduce the natural rate of\nunemployment?\na the level of unemployment benefit\nb_ the militancy of trade unions\nc_ the national minimum wage\nd the participation on training courses", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment (NRU) is the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium. It consists of frictional and structural unemployment. An increase in participation in training courses directly tackles structural unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills possessed by the unemployed and the skills demanded by employers for available jobs. By undertaking training, workers can acquire new, more relevant skills, making them more adaptable and employable. This reduces the skills mismatch, allows them to fill vacant positions more easily, and thereby lowers the level of structural unemployment, leading to a reduction in the overall natural rate of unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Options Explained:\n\n*   **A: the level of unemployment benefit:** An increase in the level or duration of unemployment benefits would likely *increase* the natural rate of unemployment. Higher benefits reduce the opportunity cost of being unemployed, which can lower the incentive for individuals to actively search for and accept a new job. This can prolong the period of job searching, increasing frictional unemployment and thus raising the NRU.\n\n*   **B: the militancy of trade unions:** An increase in the militancy of trade unions would likely *increase* the natural rate of unemployment. More powerful or militant trade unions can use their collective bargaining power to negotiate wages above the market-clearing equilibrium level. This creates a situation of real-wage unemployment, a form of structural unemployment, where the quantity of labour supplied exceeds the quantity demanded by firms at the artificially high wage rate. This raises the NRU.\n\n*   **C: the national minimum wage:** An increase in the national minimum wage, if set above the market equilibrium wage for low-skilled workers, is likely to *increase* the natural rate of unemployment. A higher minimum wage acts as a price floor in the labour market. Firms may respond by reducing their demand for low-skilled labour, as it has become more expensive.

It describes a state of resource allocation where it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off. While economic efficiency is a desirable outcome, achieving a specific state of Pareto optimality is not a direct or practical aim of macroeconomic policy. Macroeconomic policies, such as fiscal and monetary policy, operate on aggregate variables like GDP, inflation, and unemployment. These policies often involve trade-offs that benefit some groups in the economy while potentially harming others (e.g., raising interest rates to curb inflation benefits savers but increases costs for borrowers). Therefore, macroeconomic interventions are not typically designed to meet the strict conditions of Pareto optimality.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. economic development:**\nEconomic development is a fundamental and broad long-term objective of macroeconomic policy. It goes beyond mere economic growth (an increase in real GDP) to encompass qualitative improvements in the standard of living, such as better education, healthcare, infrastructure, and greater economic freedom. Governments use a combination of fiscal, monetary, and supply-side policies to create an environment conducive to sustainable economic development.\n\n**B. exchange rate stability:**\nMaintaining a stable exchange rate is a key macroeconomic objective for many governments, particularly in economies that are highly open to international trade and capital flows. A volatile exchange rate can create uncertainty for importers and exporters, discourage foreign direct investment, and contribute to price instability (e.g., imported inflation). Central banks may use monetary policy or direct intervention in foreign exchange markets to manage and stabilise the value of their currency.\n\n**D. satisfactory balance of payments:**\nAchieving a satisfactory or sustainable balance of payments position is a classic aim of macroeconomic policy. This typically means avoiding large, persistent current account deficits, which could lead to a depletion of foreign reserves, a rapid depreciation of the currency, and an unsustainable build-up of external debt. Conversely, large, persistent surpluses can also be problematic.

This corresponds to point **F** on the expectations-augmented Phillips curve diagram, where the economy is on both the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC) and a short-run Phillips curve (SRPC 1). At this point, unemployment is at the natural rate of unemployment (NRU), and the actual rate of inflation equals the expected rate of inflation.\n\n**1. Short-Run Impact (Movement from F to J):**\nAn increase in aggregate demand (from AD1 to AD2) leads to a higher price level and higher real output in the short run. The rise in real output corresponds to a fall in the unemployment rate. As the increase in AD was unanticipated, inflation expectations remain unchanged in the immediate short term. Consequently, the economy moves along the existing short-run Phillips curve (SRPC 1) to a point of lower unemployment and higher actual inflation. This movement is represented by the shift from point **F** to point **J**. At point J, the unemployment rate is below the NRU, and the actual inflation rate is higher than the expected inflation rate.\n\n**2. Long-Run Adjustment (Movement from J to K):**\nThe position at J is not sustainable in the long run. Because the actual inflation rate is now higher than what was expected, economic agents (workers and firms) will revise their inflation expectations upwards. As they negotiate new contracts, they will demand higher nominal wages to compensate for the higher anticipated inflation. This increase in wage costs causes the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to shift to the left, and correspondingly, the short-run Phillips curve shifts upwards from SRPC 1 to SRPC 2. This upward shift reflects the new, higher expected rate of inflation. As the SRPC shifts, the unemployment rate rises back towards the NRU. The economy eventually settles at a new long-run equilibrium at point **K**, which lies on the LRPC and the new, higher SRPC 2. At point K, unemployment has returned to the NRU, but both actual and expected inflation are at a permanently higher level.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence of events is a short-run movement from F to J, followed by a long-run adjustment from J to K.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A) F to G to H:**\nThis path is incorrect. The initial movement from F to G represents a rise in unemployment and a fall in inflation along SRPC 1. This would be caused by a decrease, not an increase, in aggregate demand. The subsequent move to H implies a downward revision of inflation expectations, which is inconsistent with the effects of an expansionary demand-side shock.\n\n**B) F to G to K:**\nThis path is incorrect because the initial movement from F to G signifies an economic contraction (higher unemployment), which contradicts the stated increase in aggregate demand.\n\n**C) F to J to H:**\nThis path is partially correct in the short run but incorrect in the long run. The movement from F to J correctly shows the short-run impact of an increase in aggregate demand. However, the subsequent adjustment from J to H is incorrect. A move to H would mean that inflation expectations have fallen (shifting the SRPC down to SRPC 3), leading to a new long-run equilibrium with lower inflation. This is the opposite of what would happen; the higher inflation at J causes expectations to rise, not fall."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_263.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "23 how could high interest rates increase a country\u2019s rate of inflation?\na by increasing the current borrowing costs of business\nb by increasing the current borrowing costs of government\nc by increasing the foreign exchange rate of the currency\nd by increasing the opportunity cost of spending", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nHigh interest rates can lead to cost-push inflation by increasing the borrowing costs for businesses. Many firms rely on loans and overdrafts to finance their day-to-day operations (working capital) and investment projects. When the central bank raises interest rates, the cost for commercial banks to borrow money increases, and this higher cost is passed on to businesses in the form of higher interest rates on their loans. This raises firms' costs of production. To maintain their profitability, businesses may pass these additional costs on to consumers by increasing the prices of their goods and services. A widespread increase in prices across many industries due to rising production costs is known as cost-push inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Options Explained\n\n**B. by increasing the current borrowing costs of government:** While higher interest rates do increase the cost for the government to borrow and service its national debt, this does not typically cause inflation. An increase in government spending on debt interest might lead to a larger budget deficit. However, to counteract this, a government is more likely to reduce spending in other areas or increase taxes, both of which would reduce aggregate demand and exert downward, not upward, pressure on inflation.\n\n**C. by increasing the foreign exchange rate of the currency:** Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign financial investment, known as 'hot money' flows, as investors seek higher returns. This increases the demand for the country's currency, causing its foreign exchange rate to appreciate. A stronger currency makes imported goods and raw materials cheaper. This lowers the domestic price level and reduces costs for businesses that rely on imports, thereby decreasing inflationary pressures, not increasing them.\n\n**D. by increasing the opportunity cost of spending:** Higher interest rates increase the return on savings, which in turn increases the opportunity cost of consumption and investment. Faced with a higher reward for saving, both consumers and businesses are incentivised to postpone spending and save more instead. This reduction in consumption and investment leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, which helps to reduce demand-pull inflation, rather than increase it. This is the primary mechanism through which central banks use high interest rates to combat inflation."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_264.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "24 what is most likely to influence subsequent increases in national income as a result of a\ngovernment policy of reduced interest rates?\na marginal cost\nb_ marginal efficiency of capital\nc_ marginal product\nd_ marginal utility", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe **marginal efficiency of capital (MEC)** is the expected rate of return on the last or marginal unit of capital added to the capital stock. According to Keynesian investment theory, a rational firm will undertake an investment project only if its MEC is greater than or equal to the market rate of interest. The interest rate represents the cost of borrowing funds to finance the investment.\n\nWhen a government enacts a policy of reduced interest rates, it lowers the cost of borrowing for firms. This means that investment projects that were previously unprofitable (because their MEC was lower than the old, higher interest rate) now become profitable. As a result, firms increase their level of investment spending. This increase in investment is an injection into the circular flow of income, which increases aggregate demand and leads to a multiplied increase in the national income. Therefore, the MEC is the key determinant that influences how much investment, and consequently national income, will increase in response to a fall in interest rates.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Marginal Cost**\n\nMarginal cost (MC) is the additional cost incurred in producing one more unit of a good or service. While a change in interest rates can affect a firm's financing costs and thus its overall cost structure, MC is primarily concerned with short-run production decisions (i.e., how much to produce with existing capital). The decision to invest in *new* capital\u2014the primary channel through which lower interest rates stimulate national income\u2014is a long-run decision based on a comparison of the expected return of that capital (the MEC) against the cost of financing it (the interest rate), not on the marginal cost of current production.\n\n**C. Marginal Product**\n\nMarginal product (MP) refers to the additional output generated by adding one more unit of a factor of production (such as labour or capital), holding all other inputs constant. While the marginal product of capital is a component in calculating the MEC, it is not the deciding factor itself. The marginal product is a physical measure (e.g., extra cars produced), whereas the MEC is a financial measure (a percentage rate of return). The investment decision is a financial one, directly comparing the expected monetary return (MEC) with the monetary cost of capital (the interest rate).\n\n**D. Marginal Utility**\n\nMarginal utility is the additional satisfaction or benefit a consumer derives from consuming one more unit of a good or service. This is a core concept in the theory of consumer behaviour and demand. While lower interest rates may encourage consumers to spend more and save less, thereby increasing the consumption component of national income, marginal utility itself explains how consumers allocate their spending among different goods to maximise satisfaction. It does not explain the firm's investment decision, which is the direct link between interest rates and capital formation, a critical driver of changes in national income."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_265.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_31.pdf", "questionText": "25 which policy to reduce a current account deficit on the balance of payments could be described\nas an expenditure-switching policy?\na adecrease in government spending\nb adecrease in the exchange rate of the country\u2019s currency\nc_anincrease in domestic income taxes\nd_anincrease in domestic interest rates", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAn expenditure-switching policy is a macroeconomic tool designed to correct a current account deficit by altering the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods and services. This encourages both domestic and foreign consumers to shift their spending away from foreign-produced goods and towards domestically-produced goods.\n\nA decrease in the exchange rate of the country's currency (a depreciation or devaluation) makes imports more expensive in the domestic currency. Consequently, domestic consumers and firms are incentivised to switch their expenditure from imported goods to cheaper domestic alternatives. Simultaneously, the country's exports become cheaper in terms of foreign currencies, making them more competitive and attractive to foreign buyers, who then switch their spending towards these exports. This dual effect of reducing import expenditure and increasing export revenue directly addresses the current account deficit by switching the pattern of global spending.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: a decrease in government spending\n\nA decrease in government spending is a form of contractionary fiscal policy. Its primary effect is to reduce aggregate demand (AD) within the economy. By lowering AD, national income falls, which in turn leads to a reduction in the demand for all goods and services, including imports. This type of policy is classified as an **expenditure-reducing** (or expenditure-dampening) policy because it works by lowering the overall level of spending in the economy, rather than by changing the relative prices to encourage a switch in spending patterns.\n\n#### C: an increase in domestic income taxes\n\nAn increase in domestic income taxes is another form of contractionary fiscal policy. It reduces the disposable income of households, leading to a decrease in consumption, a key component of aggregate demand. Similar to a cut in government spending, the resulting fall in aggregate demand and national income reduces the overall demand for imports. Therefore, this is also an **expenditure-reducing** policy, not an expenditure-switching one, as it curbs total spending rather than redirecting it.\n\n#### D: an increase in domestic interest rates\n\nAn increase in domestic interest rates is a form of contractionary monetary policy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, which tends to reduce both consumer spending and business investment. This dampens aggregate demand, lowers national income, and consequently reduces demand for imports. Like options A and C, this is an **expenditure-reducing** policy.

Tied aid is a grant or loan that is given on the condition that the recipient country uses the funds to purchase goods and services from the donor country. This is highly restrictive for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Limits Choice:** The recipient country is prevented from seeking the best value for money on the global market. It must buy from the donor, even if other countries offer better quality products at a lower price.\n2.  **Reduces Aid Value:** Because the recipient may be forced to pay higher prices for goods and services from the donor country, the real value of the aid is significantly diminished.\n3.  **Distorts Markets:** It can lead to the import of inappropriate technology or goods that do not suit the recipient's needs or level of development. It can also undermine local producers in the recipient country who cannot compete with the subsidised imports.\n\nTherefore, tying grants to the purchase of donor country goods is a prime example of a restrictive condition placed on foreign aid.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: food aid in the event of natural catastrophes such as severe drought**\nThis describes **humanitarian aid**, which is provided in response to emergencies to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. While there are logistical conditions for its delivery, this type of aid is generally not considered \"restrictive\" in an economic policy sense. Its provision is conditional on the existence of a crisis, not on the recipient country adhering to specific economic or trade policies dictated by the donor.\n\n**C: loans that are repaid over a long period at a low rate of interest**\nThis describes a **concessional loan** (or \"soft loan\"). These terms are deliberately made more favourable than those available on commercial markets. The long repayment period and low-interest rate are designed to reduce the debt-servicing burden on the low-income country.

This is a multidimensional concept that includes not only material wealth (e.g., real GDP per capita) but also non-material factors such as health, education, and environmental quality. An increase in the number of doctors directly enhances the provision of healthcare services. This leads to improvements in key health indicators, such as higher life expectancy, lower infant and maternal mortality rates, and better management of diseases. A healthier population is not only a direct improvement in well-being but also contributes to a more productive workforce, which can foster economic growth and further raise material living standards. Therefore, an increase in the number of doctors is a direct and significant cause of rising living standards.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nGold reserves are assets held by a country's central bank. In modern economic systems based on fiat currency, the value of a nation's currency is not directly tied to its gold holdings. While large gold reserves can contribute to financial stability and international confidence, an increase in these reserves does not directly translate into an improved quality of life for the general population. The reserves are not used to produce consumer goods or services, nor do they directly increase household incomes. The resources used to acquire more gold could have been invested in other areas, such as infrastructure or education, which would have a more direct and substantial impact on living standards.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAn increase in the number of people per house indicates greater housing density or overcrowding. This is typically viewed as a negative indicator of living standards. Overcrowded living conditions can lead to a lower quality of life, reduced privacy, increased stress, and a higher risk of the spread of communicable diseases. It often reflects a shortage of affordable housing or low-income levels, forcing more people to share limited space. Consequently, an increase in this metric signals a *decline*, not a rise, in living standards.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAn increase in the money supply, if not matched by a proportional increase in the economy's output of goods and services (real GDP), will lead to inflation. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level, which reduces the purchasing power of money. If individuals' nominal incomes do not rise as fast as prices, their real incomes fall, meaning they can afford fewer goods and services. This represents a decrease in material living standards.

The high-income country benefits by addressing a seasonal labour shortage in its agricultural sector. This ensures that crops are harvested, preventing economic losses for producers and maintaining food supply for consumers. The low-income country benefits because its citizens find employment opportunities and earn wages that are typically higher than those available domestically. These wages are often sent back home as remittances, which represent a significant source of foreign currency and income for the low-income country, improving the living standards of the workers' families.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option does not illustrate a mutual benefit. For the low-income country, corrupt practices and the failure to fulfil contracts are significant disadvantages that deter foreign investment and harm its economic reputation. They represent a cost and a risk, not a benefit of trade. While increased infrastructure investment from a high-income country would be a benefit, the scenario described for the low-income country is a negative factor that undermines trade relationships.\n\n**B:** This combination describes a situation of economic distress and potentially predatory lending, not mutual benefit. A low-income country experiencing \"liquidity problems\" is facing an economic challenge, not reaping a benefit from trade.

A rational consumer allocates their spending across different goods and services to the point where the marginal utility derived from the last dollar spent on each item is equal. This can be expressed by the formula:\n\n**MUx / Px = MUy / Py**\n\nWhere:\n*   **MUx** is the marginal utility of the last unit of good X.\n*   **Px** is the price of good X.\n*   **MUy** is the marginal utility of the last unit of good Y.\n*   **Py** is the price of good Y.\n\nThe ratio **MU/P** represents the marginal utility per dollar. If this ratio is not equal across all goods, a consumer can increase their total utility by reallocating their spending. For example, if MUx/Px > MUy/Py, the consumer gets more satisfaction from the last dollar spent on X than on Y. They should therefore buy more of X and less of Y. This continues until the equality is restored, at which point total utility is maximised, and there is no incentive to change the spending pattern.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: to obtain the same total utility from each commodity**\n\nThis is incorrect. A consumer's goal is to maximise their *overall* total utility from all goods consumed, not to equalise the total utility derived from each individual good. Consumers typically spend very different amounts on various goods and, as a result, derive vastly different levels of total utility from them. For instance, the total utility a consumer gets from their housing over a year will almost certainly be much greater than the total utility they get from consuming salt, yet their spending pattern can still be optimal.\n\n**B: to obtain the same total utility per $ spent on each commodity**\n\nThis is incorrect because consumer optimisation decisions are based on marginal analysis, not on total or average figures. This option describes equating the *average* utility per dollar (Total Utility / Price). However, a rational consumer makes decisions based on the satisfaction gained from the *next* or *last* unit consumed. The law of diminishing marginal utility dictates that the satisfaction from each additional unit decreases. Therefore, the relevant metric for allocating the next dollar of spending is the marginal utility it will provide, not the average utility of all dollars spent so far.\n\n**C: to obtain the same utility from the last unit of each commodity**\n\nThis is incorrect because it fails to account for the different prices of commodities. Equating the marginal utility from the last unit of each good (MUx = MUy) is only optimal if all goods have the same price. If goods have different prices, a consumer must consider the utility gained relative to the cost. For example, if the last unit of a car provides the same marginal utility as the last can of soda, the consumer has clearly not maximised their utility, as the car costs thousands of times more. The consumer must weigh marginal utility against price to make a rational choice."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_272.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "2 which feature of indifference curve theory is most likely to apply in reality?\na_ the consumer can express preferences between all possible combinations of goods.\nb the consumer has a limited income to spend.\nc_ the consumer will always behave rationally.\nd the consumer will always get positive utility from having more of the goods.", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe statement that a consumer has a limited income to spend is the most realistic feature of indifference curve theory. This concept is represented by the budget line (or budget constraint) and reflects the fundamental economic problem of scarcity. In the real world, virtually all consumers face financial limitations. Their income is finite, while their wants are potentially infinite. This scarcity of resources forces consumers to make choices and trade-offs, which is the central focus of consumer choice theory. The budget constraint is not merely a theoretical assumption but a tangible and universal reality for consumers.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The consumer can express preferences between all possible combinations of goods.**\nThis is a core assumption of indifference curve theory known as the axiom of *completeness*. It posits that a consumer can compare any two bundles of goods and decide whether they prefer one to the other or are indifferent between them. While this assumption is necessary to construct a complete indifference map, it is unlikely to hold true in reality. The modern economy offers a vast and complex array of goods and services, and it is cognitively impossible for a consumer to have considered, let alone ranked, all possible combinations.\n\n**C. The consumer will always behave rationally.**\nThis is the assumption of *rationality*, which underpins traditional microeconomic models. A rational consumer is defined as one who makes consistent choices (transitivity) and aims to maximize their total utility given their budget constraint. However, the field of behavioural economics has provided substantial evidence that real-world consumers often deviate from this model. Their decisions can be influenced by psychological biases, emotions, social pressures, and imperfect information, leading to behaviour that is not strictly rational in the economic sense.\n\n**D. The consumer will always get positive utility from having more of the goods.**\nThis assumption is known as *non-satiation*, or the \"more is better\" principle. It states that a consumer will always prefer a bundle with more of at least one good, holding the quantity of other goods constant. While this is often true, it is not an absolute rule. The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests that as consumption of a good increases, the additional satisfaction gained from each extra unit decreases. Eventually, a point of satiation can be reached where consuming more provides no extra utility or can even lead to negative utility (disutility).

The social benefit of consumption is therefore greater than the private benefit. In this case, the consumption is the act of motorbike riders wearing helmets. While wearing a helmet provides a private benefit to the rider (increased safety), it also generates a positive effect on a third party: society as a whole, via the healthcare system. Fewer and less severe head injuries from motorbike accidents mean a reduced need for publicly funded or collectively insured emergency services, hospital beds, and long-term rehabilitative care. This reduction in the burden on the healthcare system frees up scarce medical resources for other patients and reduces the cost to taxpayers or insurance premium payers. This benefit to society is a classic example of a positive externality of consumption.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** Expenses incurred on surveillance to ensure compliance represent a cost of implementing and enforcing the government's policy, not a benefit. An externality can be negative (a cost) or positive (a benefit), but this option describes a cost, not a positive benefit. Furthermore, this cost is associated with the government's regulation rather than being a direct spillover effect from the act of consuming helmets.\n\n**C:** The increased life expectancy of motorbike riders is a **private benefit**, not an externality. This is the direct benefit received by the individual consumer (the rider) from wearing a helmet. An externality, by definition, is a spillover effect on a third party\u2014someone other than the consumer or producer. While increased safety is the primary goal of the policy, it represents the internal, private gain to the user, not an external, social gain.\n\n**D:** Increased profits for helmet manufacturers represent a **private benefit** to the producers, not a positive externality.

The price is then determined by the average revenue (AR) or demand curve at that quantity.\n\nAn increase in a firm's fixed costs affects the total cost of production. Specifically, it raises the average total cost (AC), causing the AC curve to shift upwards. However, fixed costs, by definition, do not change with the level of output. Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost from producing one additional unit of output. Since fixed costs do not vary with output, a change in fixed costs has no impact on the firm's marginal cost.\n\nConsequently, the MC curve does not shift. The MR curve, which is derived from the demand curve, is also unaffected. As the profit-maximising condition (MR=MC) still occurs at the same point of intersection between the unchanged MR and MC curves, the profit-maximising level of output remains **unchanged**.\n\nBecause the output level is unchanged and the demand (AR) curve has not shifted, the price that the firm charges also remains **unchanged**.\n\nProfit is calculated as Total Revenue (TR) minus Total Cost (TC). Since both price and output are unchanged, Total Revenue (Price x Quantity) is also unchanged. However, the increase in fixed costs leads to a higher Total Cost for any given level of output.

A change in fixed costs does not affect the marginal cost (MC) or marginal revenue (MR) curves.

Profit would fall due to higher costs, not rise.\n\n**B: price rise, output fall, profit fall**\nThis is incorrect. While profit does fall, the reasoning regarding price and output is flawed. An increase in fixed costs does not alter the firm's profit-maximising output or price in the short run, as it does not affect the marginal cost of production or the demand conditions. The firm continues to produce where MR=MC, which occurs at the same output and price as before the cost change.\n\n**C: price unchanged, output rise, profit rise**\nThis is incorrect. Output would not rise. The profit-maximising output is determined by the intersection of the MC and MR curves, neither of which shifts due to a change in fixed costs.

The bus company is engaging in a form of price discrimination known as inter-temporal price discrimination.\n\nIt segments its market based on the time of purchase. Customers who plan ahead and book their tickets one month in advance are likely to be more price-sensitive (have a higher price elasticity of demand). They are rewarded with a lower price. Conversely, customers who purchase tickets closer to the departure date often have more urgent or inflexible travel needs and are therefore less price-sensitive (have a lower price elasticity of demand). The company charges these customers a higher price. By charging different prices based on the timing of the purchase, the monopoly can capture more consumer surplus and maximise its total revenue.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Minimum pricing:**\nMinimum pricing refers to a price floor, typically set by a government or regulatory body, below which a good or service cannot be legally sold. It is not a pricing strategy employed by a firm itself to maximise profit. The purpose of a minimum price is usually to protect producers' incomes or to discourage the consumption of certain goods (e.g., demerit goods like alcohol). The scenario describes a pricing decision made by the company, not a government-imposed restriction.\n\n**B. Predatory pricing:**\nPredatory pricing is an anti-competitive strategy where a firm deliberately sets its prices at a very low level, often below its average variable costs, with the intention of driving competitors out of the market. Once the competition has been eliminated, the firm can raise its prices to monopoly levels. This strategy is irrelevant in this scenario because the bus company is already a monopoly and has no competitors to drive out.\n\n**D. Price leadership:**\nPrice leadership is a pricing strategy that occurs in an oligopolistic market structure, where there are a few dominant firms. One firm, typically the largest or most efficient, acts as the \"price leader\" by initiating price changes, which are then followed by the other firms in the market.

This occurs at the output level where the marginal social benefit (MSB) of consumption is equal to the marginal social cost (MSC) of production.\n\nIn the given diagram, the free market equilibrium occurs at point X, where the marginal private benefit (MPB) equals the marginal private cost (MPC). However, the marginal social cost (MSC) curve lies above the marginal private cost (MPC) curve, indicating the presence of a negative externality in production (e.g., pollution). This means the full cost to society of producing the good is higher than the cost borne by the private firms.\n\nAt the market equilibrium quantity (corresponding to point X), the MSC is greater than the MSB. This signifies overproduction and a misallocation of resources, leading to a deadweight welfare loss.\n\nTo achieve allocative efficiency, the market must move to the socially optimal equilibrium, which is where the MSC curve intersects the MSB curve. This point is at a lower quantity and a higher price compared to the market equilibrium at X. Therefore, to correct this market failure, production and consumption must decrease, and the price must increase to reflect the full social cost of production.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. a decrease in production and no change in price**\nWhile a decrease in production is necessary to move towards the socially optimal quantity, a change in price is also required. To reduce the quantity supplied and demanded, the price must rise. A higher price signals the true social cost to consumers, leading them to demand less, and it incentivises producers to supply less. A constant price would not achieve the new, allocatively efficient equilibrium.\n\n**C. an increase in consumption and a decrease in production**\nThis statement is internally inconsistent for a market in equilibrium, as the quantity consumed must equal the quantity produced. Furthermore, the problem identified is overproduction due to a negative externality. Correcting this requires a *decrease* in both production and consumption, not an increase in consumption.\n\n**D. an increase in price and no change in production**\nAn increase in price is a necessary component of the adjustment to allocative efficiency. However, the fundamental problem is that the market is producing too much of the good from a social perspective. Therefore, production must decrease.

Markets will become more efficient.**\n\nA subsidy is a form of government intervention that distorts the price signals in a free market. While the *objective* of subsidising green energy is to correct a market failure\u2014specifically, the under-provision of goods with positive externalities\u2014the subsidy itself does not make the market mechanism more efficient. Instead, it alters the market outcome.\n\nFrom the perspective of private costs and benefits, a subsidy drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive. This moves the market away from the privately efficient equilibrium (where marginal private cost equals marginal private benefit). While this intervention may lead to a more *socially* efficient outcome by increasing the production of green energy closer to the socially optimal level, the statement that the *market itself* becomes more efficient is incorrect. Government intervention, by definition, interferes with the free market mechanism and can risk creating government failure if the subsidy is not set at the correct level, potentially leading to a new misallocation of resources.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is cheaper to use the plentiful supply of coal.**\n\nThis is a valid comment an economist might make. A key part of the economic debate around energy transition involves comparing the private costs of different energy sources. If the marginal private cost of producing electricity from coal is lower than from solar or wind, this presents a significant economic argument against subsidies for renewables, as it implies that resources are being diverted to higher-cost production methods. Economists frequently analyse these cost comparisons when evaluating energy policies.\n\n**C. The value of the positive externalities cannot be estimated.**\n\nThis is a valid and common comment in economics. Green energy generates positive externalities, such as cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved public health. The primary economic justification for a subsidy is to account for these external benefits. However, assigning an accurate monetary value to these benefits is extremely challenging. This valuation problem is a significant hurdle in determining the optimal size of the subsidy. Therefore, an economist pointing out the difficulty or impossibility of precisely estimating the value of these externalities is making a valid point.\n\n**D. The value of the negative externalities cannot be estimated.**\n\nThis is also a valid economic comment. The argument for subsidising green energy is often linked to reducing the use of fossil fuels, which create significant negative externalities (e.g., pollution, climate change). A key aspect of calculating the appropriate subsidy for a clean alternative involves understanding the social cost of the polluting good it replaces. Just like with positive externalities, placing a precise monetary value on the damage caused by pollution and climate change is fraught with difficulty and uncertainty. Highlighting this measurement problem is a central and valid part of the economic discussion on environmental policy."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_282.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "12 in which situation is the introduction of a minimum wage most likely to raise employment\nopportunities as well as wages?\na firms face intense competition both at home and abroad.\nb_ labour costs are a high proportion of the total cost of the firm.\nc_ the minimum wage is not high enough to lower the profits of the firms.\nd the minimum wage introduced in monopsony is less than the marginal revenue productivity\n(mrp) of the last worker employed.", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn a monopsony labour market, there is a single dominant buyer of labour. This firm faces the entire upward-sloping market supply curve of labour. To hire an additional worker, the monopsonist must offer a higher wage, and this higher wage must be paid to all existing workers as well. Consequently, the Marginal Cost of Labour (MCL) is greater than the wage (which is the Average Cost of Labour, ACL). A profit-maximising monopsonist will hire labour up to the point where the Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRP) equals the Marginal Cost of Labour (MCL = MRP). The wage is then determined by the supply curve at that level of employment. This results in a wage that is below the MRP of the last worker employed (Wage < MRP).\n\nIf a minimum wage is introduced that is above the original monopsony wage but below the MRP of the last worker, the firm's cost structure changes. The marginal cost of hiring an additional worker becomes constant at the level of the minimum wage, up to the point where the minimum wage line intersects the labour supply curve. Since this new marginal cost (the minimum wage) is lower than the original MCL, and still below the MRP of workers who were not previously hired, it becomes profitable for the firm to expand employment. The firm will now hire more workers, up to the point where the MRP equals the new, lower marginal cost (the minimum wage). Therefore, in this specific scenario, a minimum wage can lead to both higher wages and higher employment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Firms face intense competition both at home and abroad.**\nThis describes a competitive market. In a competitive labour market, firms are wage-takers, and the wage is determined by the intersection of market demand and supply. If a minimum wage is introduced above this equilibrium level, it acts as a price floor. At this higher wage, the quantity of labour supplied will exceed the quantity of labour demanded, leading to a surplus of labour, which is unemployment. Therefore, in a competitive market, a minimum wage is expected to decrease employment, not raise it.\n\n**B. Labour costs are a high proportion of the total cost of the firm.**\nThis condition affects the price elasticity of demand for labour. According to the Marshall-Hicks laws of derived demand, the demand for labour will be more elastic (i.e., more responsive to wage changes) when labour costs form a larger proportion of the firm's total costs. If a minimum wage raises the wage rate, firms with high labour costs will be more incentivised to reduce employment significantly, either by substituting capital for labour or by reducing output, in order to control their costs. This would lead to a larger fall in employment, not an increase.\n\n**C. The minimum wage is not high enough to lower the profits of the firms.**\nA minimum wage that is effective (i.e., set above the existing market wage) will necessarily increase the firm's labour costs. All else being equal, an increase in costs will lead to a decrease in profits. It is the specific market structure of monopsony, not the effect on profits, that creates the conditions under which employment might rise. Even in the monopsony case where employment increases, the firm's monopsony profits are reduced because it is now paying a higher wage. Thus, this statement does not accurately describe the mechanism for increasing employment and is likely an incorrect premise."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_283.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "13 the diagram shows a firm\u2019s initial marginal revenue product of labour curve (mrp,).\nmarginal revenue\nproduct of labour ~\nmrp,\nmrp2\n2 labour hours\n\nwhat could cause the curve to shift to mrp2?\na _afall in the wage rate\nb a fall in the price of the final product\nc_ arise in the wage rate\nd arise in the price of the final product", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe marginal revenue product of labour (MRP) is the additional revenue a firm generates by employing one more unit of labour. It is calculated by multiplying the marginal physical product of labour (MPP) by the marginal revenue (MR) from selling the additional output: MRP = MPP \u00d7 MR. In a perfectly competitive product market, marginal revenue is equal to the price (P) of the final product, so the formula becomes MRP = MPP \u00d7 P.\n\nA shift in the MRP curve is caused by a change in one of its determinants: MPP or MR (price). The shift from MRP\u2081 to MRP\u2082 is a leftward or inward shift, indicating that for any given quantity of labour, the marginal revenue product is now lower. A fall in the price of the final product directly reduces the MR (or P) component of the MRP calculation. This means that even if labour productivity (MPP) remains the same, the revenue generated from each worker's output is lower. Consequently, the entire MRP curve shifts to the left.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a fall in the wage rate**\n\nA change in the wage rate does not shift the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve. The MRP curve represents the firm's demand for labour, showing the value of each additional worker to the firm. The wage rate represents the marginal cost of labour (MCL). A firm hires labour up to the point where MRP = MCL. A fall in the wage rate would lower the marginal cost of labour, leading to a movement *down along* the existing MRP\u2081 curve, as the firm would find it profitable to hire more labour hours at the lower cost. It does not change the underlying productivity or the revenue generated by each worker, so the curve itself does not shift.\n\n**C. a rise in the wage rate**\n\nSimilar to a fall in the wage rate, a rise in the wage rate causes a movement *along* the MRP curve, not a shift of the curve. A higher wage rate increases the marginal cost of labour. In response, a profit-maximising firm would reduce its employment of labour, moving upwards and to the left along the MRP\u2081 curve.

This is the optimal level of employment because any additional worker hired beyond this point would cost more to employ than the revenue they generate, thus reducing total profit.\n\nLet's analyse the firm's decision for each additional worker:\n*   **1st worker:** MRP (\u00a350) > MCL (\u00a330). Hiring this worker adds \u00a320 to the firm's profit.\n*   **2nd worker:** MRP (\u00a340) > MCL (\u00a330). Hiring this worker adds a further \u00a310 to the firm's profit.\n*   **3rd worker:** MRP (\u00a330) = MCL (\u00a330). The revenue generated by this worker exactly covers their cost. The firm will employ this worker to reach the profit-maximising quantity where MRP = MCL.\n*   **4th worker:** MRP (\u00a320) < MCL (\u00a330). Hiring this worker would result in a loss of \u00a310 on that unit of labour, reducing the firm's total profit.\n\nTherefore, the firm will maximise its profit by employing 3 units of labour.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nEmploying only 1 unit of labour would not be profit-maximising. While the first worker is profitable (MRP of \u00a350 > MCL of \u00a330), the firm can increase its total profit further. The second worker also contributes positively to profit, as their MRP (\u00a340) is greater than their MCL (\u00a330). A profit-maximising firm will continue to hire as long as MRP > MCL, so stopping at one worker would mean forgoing additional, achievable profit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nEmploying only 2 units of labour is also sub-optimal. After hiring the second worker, the firm has the opportunity to hire a third. For the third worker, the MRP (\u00a330) is equal to the MCL (\u00a330). According to the profit-maximisation rule (MRP = MCL), the firm should employ this worker. While this worker does not add to the total profit, they do not subtract from it either. Failing to hire this third worker means the firm has not fully exhausted all profitable or non-loss-making employment opportunities, and has thus not reached its profit-maximising equilibrium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nEmploying 4 units of labour would lead to a reduction in the firm's total profit. The condition for profit maximisation is to employ workers up to the point where MRP \u2265 MCL. For the fourth worker, the MRP is \u00a320, while the MCL is \u00a330. Since the cost of this worker exceeds the revenue they generate (MCL > MRP), hiring them would decrease the firm's overall profit by \u00a310.

This policy can have an immediate effect on reducing income inequality in the short run. By mandating a minimum level of pay, it directly increases the earnings of the lowest-paid workers, provided they remain employed. This action compresses the wage distribution from the bottom up, thus narrowing the gap between the lowest and higher earners. The implementation of such a policy, from legislation to enforcement, can occur relatively quickly, making it an effective short-run tool. While economists debate the potential for negative employment effects if the minimum wage is set too high, its primary and most immediate impact is the increase in income for low-wage workers.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. Increase the general sales tax/VAT rate on luxury goods.**\nThis policy aims to make the tax system more progressive, as luxury goods are disproportionately consumed by high-income individuals. While it can be implemented in the short run, its effect on income inequality is indirect. It reduces the disposable income of the wealthy and generates government revenue. However, the reduction in inequality then depends on how this revenue is redistributed to lower-income groups, which is a secondary step. It does not directly increase the pre-tax income of the poor, unlike a minimum wage.\n\n**C. Invest heavily in schools and education programmes.**\nInvesting in education is a fundamental policy for reducing long-term inequality. It improves human capital, enhances skills, and increases the future earning potential of individuals, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This can lead to a more equitable distribution of income over time by reducing the wage gap between skilled and unskilled labour. However, the effects of such investments are realised only in the long run, as it takes many years for educated individuals to enter and progress within the labour force. Therefore, it is not a short-run solution.\n\n**D. Stimulate economic growth through skills and productivity training.**\nSimilar to investment in education, skills and productivity training is a supply-side policy aimed at enhancing human capital. While training programmes may be of a shorter duration than formal schooling, their impact on income inequality is not immediate. There is a time lag between the implementation of training schemes, the completion of training by workers, and the subsequent rise in their productivity and wages. This makes it a medium- to long-run policy, rather than a measure for reducing inequality in the short run."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_286.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "16 when buying a car, salma agrees to pay half of the cost now and the other half in six months\ntime.\nwhich function of money does this illustrate?\na divisibility\nb_ durability\nc standard of deferred payment\nd - store of value", "Chapter": 26, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: C. standard of deferred payment**\n\nThe function of money as a standard of deferred payment means it is a widely accepted way to value and settle a debt in the future.

It means that money can be divided into smaller denominations to facilitate transactions of various values. While Salma paying \"half\" the cost implies the total price is divisible, the core economic principle illustrated by the six-month delay in the final payment is not divisibility.

The agreement to pay later is an abstract financial arrangement and has no connection to the physical robustness of the currency itself.\n\n**D. store of value**\nThe store of value is the function of money that allows it to hold its purchasing power over time, enabling saving. For money to act as a standard of deferred payment, it must be a reliable store of value; otherwise, creditors would be unwilling to accept future payments due to the risk of inflation eroding the money's worth. However, the scenario specifically highlights the *agreement to settle a debt in the future*, which is the precise definition of the standard of deferred payment.

An increase in labour mobility reduces both frictional and structural unemployment, thus lowering the NRU.\n\nLabour mobility refers to the ease with which workers can move between different occupations (occupational mobility) and geographical locations (geographical mobility).\n\n*   **Impact on Frictional Unemployment:** Higher geographical mobility allows unemployed workers to move more easily to regions where jobs are available, shortening their job search time.\n*   **Impact on Structural Unemployment:** Higher occupational mobility, often facilitated by retraining schemes and transferable skills, allows workers from declining industries to transition into growing sectors. This reduces the mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the skills demanded by employers.\n\nBy making the labour market more flexible and efficient, an increase in labour mobility leads to a lower natural rate of unemployment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: when there is a decline in the education levels of workers**\nThis is incorrect. A decline in the education levels of the workforce would likely lead to a greater skills mismatch between what workers can offer and what employers need. This would worsen structural unemployment, which is a component of the natural rate of unemployment. Consequently, a decline in education levels would cause the natural rate of unemployment to rise, not fall.\n\n**B: when there is an increase in income tax rates**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in income tax rates reduces the net, after-tax wage for workers. This can create a disincentive to work, as the reward from employment is diminished. This may lead some individuals to extend their job search in the hope of a higher pre-tax wage, or even to leave the labour force altogether. This would tend to increase frictional unemployment and therefore raise the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n**D: when there is a rise in the rate of state unemployment benefits**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in the generosity of unemployment benefits lowers the opportunity cost of being unemployed. With a higher safety net, unemployed individuals may feel less pressure to accept the first available job offer and may choose to search for a longer period to find a more suitable or better-paying position. This extension of the average job search period increases frictional unemployment, causing the natural rate of unemployment to rise."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_288.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "18 acountry has increasing productivity and falling unemployment.\nwhat can be concluded from this information?\na_ economic efficiency has increased.\nb_ interest rates have increased.\nc_ taxation has increased.\nd_ the labour force has increased.", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nEconomic efficiency refers to the optimal use of scarce resources to produce goods and services. It encompasses two main types: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency.\n\n1.  **Increasing Productivity:** Productivity is a measure of output per unit of input (e.g., output per worker per hour). An increase in productivity means that the economy is generating more output from the same amount of resources, or the same output with fewer resources. This is a direct indicator of an increase in **productive efficiency**. It causes an outward shift in the country's long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve and its production possibility frontier (PPF), signifying a greater potential output for the economy.\n\n2.  **Falling Unemployment:** Unemployment represents idle labour resources. A fall in unemployment signifies that more of the available labour force is being actively used in production. This means the economy is moving from a point inside its production possibility frontier (PPF) closer to the frontier itself. This movement represents a reduction in inefficiency and a better utilisation of existing resources.\n\nSince both increasing productivity and falling unemployment indicate that the country is using its resources more effectively and producing more output, it can be definitively concluded that the country's overall economic efficiency has increased.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B. Interest rates have increased.**\nWhile it is possible that interest rates have increased, this is not a necessary conclusion. A growing economy, characterised by falling unemployment, may lead to demand-pull inflation. In response, a central bank might raise interest rates as part of a contractionary monetary policy to curb inflation. However, the increase in productivity shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right, which can counteract inflationary pressures. If the growth is primarily supply-led and non-inflationary, the central bank would have no reason to raise interest rates. Therefore, an increase in interest rates is a possible policy response, not a direct consequence that can be concluded from the information given.\n\n**C. Taxation has increased.**\nThere is no direct logical connection that allows one to conclude that taxation has increased. While a growing economy with more people employed will lead to higher total tax *revenue* for the government (more income and profits to tax), this does not mean that tax *rates* have increased. In fact, the economic growth might have been stimulated by a *decrease* in taxation (expansionary fiscal policy). The observed changes could be entirely independent of any change in tax policy.\n\n**D. The labour force has increased.**\nFalling unemployment does not necessarily mean the labour force has grown. The labour force is defined as the sum of employed and unemployed people. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force. Unemployment can fall for several reasons:\n*   Unemployed individuals find jobs (increasing employment).\n*   Unemployed individuals leave the labour force (e.g., due to retirement, returning to education, or becoming discouraged workers).\nIt is possible for unemployment to fall even if the labour force is shrinking or remains constant. For example, if the rate of job creation is higher than the growth rate of the labour force, unemployment will fall. Conversely, if people leave the labour force faster than jobs are being lost, unemployment can also fall. Therefore, an increase in the labour force cannot be concluded."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_289.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "19 the diagram shows full employment, national income, and expenditure (amd). the economy is in\nequilibrium at j.\namd (c+i1+g+x-m),\nk\n!

This shortfall is the combined effect of all components: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (X-M).

This has direct and predictable consequences for the government's fiscal position.\n\n*   **Effect on Tax Revenue:** Tax revenue is a function of the tax base (e.g., income, profits, consumption) and the tax rate. An increase in unemployment means fewer people are earning incomes, leading to a fall in revenue from income taxes. The deficiency in aggregate demand also implies that firms' sales and profits are lower, which reduces revenue from corporation taxes. Furthermore, as incomes fall, consumer spending typically decreases, leading to lower revenue from indirect taxes such as VAT or sales tax. Since the tax base shrinks while tax rates remain constant, total tax revenue will **decrease**.\n\n*   **Effect on Government Expenditure:** A significant component of government expenditure consists of transfer payments, such as unemployment benefits. When unemployment rises, more individuals become eligible for and claim these benefits. Assuming the rate of unemployment benefit per person is unchanged, the increase in the number of claimants will automatically lead to a rise in total government spending on these benefits.

In the short run, this growth is primarily driven by an increase in aggregate demand (AD). To meet this higher demand and increase production, firms need to utilise more factors of production. Labour is a key factor of production, and the demand for it is a derived demand\u2014it is derived from the demand for the goods and services that labour helps to produce. Consequently, as firms expand their output, they will hire more workers, leading to a rise in employment levels and a fall in cyclical unemployment. This direct, positive relationship between short-run economic growth and employment is a fundamental macroeconomic principle.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: balance of payments surplus**\n\nThis is unlikely. Economic growth leads to higher average incomes and increased purchasing power for consumers and firms. With more disposable income, households tend to increase their consumption of all goods and services, including those produced abroad (imports). A rise in expenditure on imports, assuming exports remain constant or grow more slowly, will worsen the current account of the balance of payments. This makes a current account deficit more likely, or a surplus less likely, not the other way around.\n\n**C: lower inflation**\n\nThis is incorrect as there is typically a short-run trade-off between economic growth and inflation. Short-run economic growth, driven by rising aggregate demand, puts upward pressure on the general price level. As the economy's total demand outstrips its ability to supply, firms may raise prices in response to both higher demand and potentially rising costs of scarcer resources. This phenomenon is known as demand-pull inflation. The relationship is often illustrated by the short-run Phillips Curve, which shows an inverse correlation between unemployment (which falls with growth) and inflation (which rises). Therefore, higher, not lower, inflation is the more probable outcome.\n\n**D: stronger exchange rate**\n\nThe effect of economic growth on the exchange rate is ambiguous and not guaranteed. There are two conflicting pressures. On one hand, higher incomes lead to increased demand for imports, which increases the supply of the domestic currency on foreign exchange markets, causing it to depreciate (weaken). On the other hand, a growing economy may attract foreign direct investment, and central banks might raise interest rates to control inflation, attracting short-term capital inflows ('hot money'). Both of these would increase the demand for the domestic currency, causing it to appreciate (strengthen). The net effect is uncertain, making a stronger exchange rate a possible but not the *most likely* outcome compared to higher employment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_292.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "22 which argument for lowering income tax rates is always valid?\na it boosts economic activity.\nb it promotes the incentive to work.\nc_ it reduces the budget deficit.\nd_ it reduces the incentive to evade taxes.", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nLowering income tax rates reduces the potential financial gain from successfully evading taxes. Tax evasion is a cost-benefit decision for some individuals and firms, where the benefit is the amount of tax avoided and the cost is the potential penalty if caught, discounted by the probability of detection. A lower tax rate directly reduces the benefit side of this equation. For any given level of enforcement and penalties, a smaller potential gain makes the risk of evasion less attractive. Therefore, the incentive to engage in illegal tax evasion is always reduced when tax rates are lowered.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It boosts economic activity.**\nThis argument is not always valid. While lower income tax rates increase disposable income, which can stimulate consumption and aggregate demand, the overall effect is uncertain. If households and firms lack confidence in the economy, they may choose to save the extra income rather than spend or invest it. Furthermore, if the tax cut leads to a larger government budget deficit, it may be financed by borrowing, which can drive up interest rates and \"crowd out\" private investment, counteracting the initial stimulus. The net effect on economic activity depends on these and other behavioural and macroeconomic factors.\n\n**B. It promotes the incentive to work.**\nThis is not always the case due to the conflicting income and substitution effects. A lower income tax rate increases the net, after-tax wage, which is the reward for working.\n*   **The substitution effect:** This makes leisure relatively more expensive, encouraging individuals to substitute work for leisure, thus increasing the incentive to work more hours.\n*   **The income effect:** With a higher net wage, individuals can achieve their target income by working fewer hours. If leisure is a normal good, they may choose to \"purchase\" more leisure by working less.\nThe overall impact on the incentive to work depends on which effect dominates. For some individuals, particularly those at higher income levels, the income effect may outweigh the substitution effect, leading them to work less. This concept is illustrated by the backward-bending supply curve of labour.\n\n**C. It reduces the budget deficit.**\nThis argument is generally not valid and is often the opposite of what occurs. A budget deficit is the shortfall between government spending and tax revenue. Ceteris paribus, lowering income tax rates reduces government revenue, thereby increasing the budget deficit. The argument that a tax cut could reduce the deficit is based on the Laffer Curve, which posits that if tax rates are prohibitively high, a rate cut could stimulate so much economic activity that the tax base expands enough to generate higher total tax revenue.

The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure that represents income or wealth inequality within a nation or social group. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 signifies perfect equality (every individual has the same income) and 1 signifies perfect inequality (one individual holds all the income, and everyone else has none). Therefore, a decrease in the Gini coefficient indicates that the distribution of income has become more equal.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: a faster rate of economic growth**\nA faster rate of economic growth, measured by the percentage increase in real GDP, does not necessarily indicate a more equal distribution of income. The relationship between growth and inequality is complex. Economic growth can lead to rising inequality if the benefits are concentrated among the highest earners. Conversely, it is possible for growth to be inclusive, benefiting lower-income groups and reducing inequality. However, the rate of growth itself is a measure of the increase in total output, not its distribution among the population. A country can experience rapid growth alongside worsening income inequality.\n\n**B: a higher Human Development Index**\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index that measures a country's average achievements in three key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life (life expectancy), knowledge (years of schooling), and a decent standard of living (Gross National Income per capita). While a higher HDI generally signifies a higher level of development, it does not directly measure income distribution. The GNI per capita component is an average and can mask significant disparities in income. A country's HDI could improve due to gains in education or health, even while income inequality worsens. While there is an Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), the standard HDI itself is not a measure of income equality.\n\n**D: a lower tax/GDP ratio**\nThe tax/GDP ratio measures the total tax revenue as a percentage of a country's GDP. This ratio indicates the extent to which the government controls the economy's resources. A lower tax/GDP ratio does not indicate a more equal income distribution. In fact, it could suggest the opposite. Governments often use tax revenue to fund social programs and transfer payments (e.g., unemployment benefits, pensions) that redistribute income from higher earners to lower earners. A lower tax take may limit the government's ability to perform this redistributive function. Furthermore, the impact of taxation on inequality depends on the tax structure (i.e., whether it is progressive, proportional, or regressive), not just the overall level of taxation."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_295.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_32.pdf", "questionText": "25 in 2018, the united states (us) government introduced tariffs on a wide range of imports from\nchina.\nwhich type of policy was the us government adopting?\na expenditure-reducing\nb_ expenditure-switching\nc expansionary monetary\nd_contractionary monetary", "Chapter": 27, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nExpenditure-switching policies are designed to alter the pattern of a country's spending, encouraging a switch from foreign-produced goods and services to domestically produced ones. Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, are a primary tool of this policy type. By increasing the price of imports, tariffs make domestically produced substitutes relatively cheaper and more attractive to consumers and firms. This incentivises a shift in expenditure away from imports and towards domestic output, aiming to improve the current account balance by reducing import expenditure and boosting demand for local goods.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: expenditure-reducing\n\nExpenditure-reducing policies aim to decrease the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy. These policies, which include contractionary fiscal measures (e.g., increased income taxes, reduced government spending) and contractionary monetary measures (e.g., higher interest rates), work by reducing the total spending power of households, firms, and the government. While a tariff might lead to a minor reduction in real income due to higher prices, its primary objective is not to reduce total expenditure but to change its composition. The goal is to redirect spending, not to curtail it overall.\n\n#### C: expansionary monetary\n\nExpansionary monetary policy involves actions taken by a central bank to increase the money supply and lower interest rates. The objective is to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing, investment, and consumption, thereby increasing aggregate demand. Introducing tariffs is a form of trade policy enacted by the government, not the central bank. It is unrelated to the management of the money supply or interest rates and is therefore not a monetary policy.\n\n#### D: contractionary monetary\n\nContractionary monetary policy involves a central bank reducing the money supply or increasing interest rates to curb inflation by dampening aggregate demand. This makes borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, thus reducing spending and investment. The implementation of tariffs is a fiscal and trade policy tool used by the government. It does not involve the central bank and is not a mechanism for controlling the money supply or interest rates.

The US company is receiving money from Brazil. Any transaction that leads to an inflow of foreign exchange is a credit (+) item in the BoP.\n\nThe transaction is recorded in the **current account**. The current account measures the flow of goods, services, primary income, and secondary income. Primary income (or net factor income from abroad) includes the returns on factors of production, such as interest, profits, and dividends.

Therefore, this dividend receipt is a credit entry in the primary income component of the US current account.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a credit in the capital account**\n\nThis is incorrect. While the transaction is a credit (an inflow of funds), it does not belong in the capital account. The capital account (under modern IMF definitions) records capital transfers (e.g., debt forgiveness) and the acquisition or disposal of non-produced, non-financial assets (e.g., patents, copyrights). Dividend payments are a return on a financial investment, which is an income flow, not a capital transfer. They are correctly classified under primary income in the current account.\n\n**C. a debit in the capital account**\n\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the transaction is an inflow of funds to the US, so it is a credit, not a debit. A debit represents an outflow of funds. Secondly, as explained above, dividend payments are recorded in the current account, not the capital account.\n\n**D. a debit in the current account**\n\nThis is incorrect because the transaction is a credit, not a debit.

A deliberate, official increase in this fixed value is called a **revaluation**. Therefore, the combination of depreciation for a decrease in a floating rate and revaluation for an increase in a fixed rate is the correct terminology.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly uses the term 'appreciation' for a fixed rate increase.

Imports are a debit (negative entry) on the current account. By minimising these imports, the net effect of the factory's production on the trade balance is maximised.\n*   **High income elasticity of demand (YED) for electric cars outside country N (1.5):** The batteries produced are exported to be used in electric cars sold abroad. A YED greater than 1 (income elastic) signifies that as incomes rise in other countries, the quantity demanded for electric cars (and thus the batteries from country N) will increase by a proportionately larger amount. Assuming global economic growth, this leads to strong and sustained growth in export revenues for country N.

A low percentage of domestically supplied raw materials (10%) means that 90% must be imported, creating a large debit on the current account. Furthermore, a low YED of 0.5 (income inelastic) means that as global incomes rise, export demand will grow by a smaller proportion, limiting the growth of export revenue. This combination of high imports and slow export growth is least likely to improve the current account.\n\n*   **B: 10% raw materials supplied by N; YED of 1.5**\n    While the high YED of 1.5 is favourable for export revenue growth, this positive effect would be significantly counteracted by the high cost of importing 90% of the necessary raw materials. The large debit on the current account from imports would diminish, and could potentially outweigh, the credit from growing exports.\n\n*   **C: 90% raw materials supplied by N; YED of 0.5**\n    This scenario is favourable in terms of minimising import costs, as 90% of raw materials are sourced domestically.

The straight diagonal line represents perfect equality, where each percentile of the population holds the same percentile of total income. The further the Lorenz curve bows away from this line, the greater the degree of inequality.\n\nThe shift of the Lorenz curve from L\u2081 to L\u2082 indicates an increase in income inequality. The area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve (the Gini coefficient area) has become larger. We must identify the policy change that would not cause, and is indeed counter to, this trend.\n\nMaking the income tax system more progressive would lead to a more equal distribution of post-tax income. A progressive tax system is one where higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in tax than lower earners. Making it *more* progressive, for instance by increasing the top marginal tax rates, would take a greater share of income from the wealthiest individuals and, through government spending and transfers, redistribute it or reduce the post-tax income gap. This would decrease income inequality, causing the Lorenz curve to shift closer to the line of perfect equality (i.e., from L\u2082 towards L\u2081), not further away. Therefore, this is the least likely cause of the observed shift.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Capital gains tax has been reduced.**\nCapital gains are profits from the sale of assets like stocks or property. Ownership of such assets is heavily concentrated among high-income and wealthy households. Reducing the tax on capital gains would disproportionately benefit the rich, increasing their disposable income relative to the rest of the population. This would lead to a more unequal distribution of income and cause the Lorenz curve to shift outwards, from L\u2081 to L\u2082, representing greater inequality.\n\n**C. Inheritance tax has been reduced.**\nInheritance tax is levied on the transfer of wealth from one generation to the next. It is a tool for reducing the concentration of wealth. Reducing or eliminating this tax allows large estates to be passed on intact, which perpetuates and exacerbates wealth and income inequality over time. This policy would contribute to a more unequal distribution, consistent with a shift of the Lorenz curve from L\u2081 to L\u2082.\n\n**D. The tax-free allowance has been decreased for everyone.**\nA tax-free allowance (or personal allowance) is the amount of income an individual can earn before paying any income tax. While a decrease affects everyone, it has a regressive effect. The value of this allowance is proportionally much greater for low-income earners than for high-income earners. Decreasing the allowance would increase the tax burden on lower earners by a larger percentage of their income compared to higher earners, thus widening the gap in disposable income and increasing inequality.

This leads to a more efficient allocation of global resources, increasing total world output. As a result, countries can experience economic growth, leading to higher average incomes. Furthermore, globalisation increases competition between firms, which can drive down prices for consumers. It also provides consumers with a greater variety and quality of goods and services. The combination of higher real incomes, lower prices, and greater choice leads to an overall increase in the material standard of living.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Absolute advantage replaces comparative advantage as the basis for trade.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The theory of comparative advantage is the fundamental principle that explains the gains from international trade. It posits that countries should specialise in producing goods where they have a lower opportunity cost, even if another country has an absolute advantage in all goods. Globalisation deepens and expands trade based on comparative advantage; it does not replace this principle. Firms and countries specialise more intensely in their areas of comparative advantage to compete in the global market.\n\n**B. Firms' supply chains are shortened.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Globalisation is characterised by the development of complex and geographically extensive global supply chains. Firms source raw materials, components, and services from various countries to minimise costs and maximise efficiency. This process leads to the lengthening and increased complexity of supply chains, not their shortening. For example, a single product may be designed in one country, have its components manufactured in several others, be assembled in yet another, and then be distributed worldwide.\n\n**C. Trade is less likely to suffer from international economic shocks.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Globalisation increases the economic interdependence between countries. While this can offer benefits, it also means that economies are more vulnerable to the transmission of international economic shocks. A recession, financial crisis, or supply disruption (such as from a natural disaster or pandemic) in one major economy can rapidly spread through trade and financial linkages to the rest of the world, causing widespread disruption.

This occurs when the marginal utility per unit of currency spent on each product is equal. This is known as the Equimarginal Principle.\n\nThe standard formula for this principle, for two goods Y and Z, is:\n**MU_Y / P_Y = MU_Z / P_Z**\n\nThis equation states that the additional utility gained from the last dollar spent on product Y is equal to the additional utility gained from the last dollar spent on product Z.\n\nBy cross-multiplying this standard formula, we can rearrange it algebraically:\n(MU_Y / P_Y) * (P_Y * P_Z) = (MU_Z / P_Z) * (P_Y * P_Z)\nThis simplifies to:\n**MU_Y \u00d7 P_Z = MU_Z \u00d7 P_Y**\n\nThis rearranged equation is mathematically equivalent to the original principle and therefore correctly represents the condition for consumer equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: when MU_Y = MU_Z**\nThis condition is incorrect because it fails to account for the prices of the products. A rational consumer's decision is based on the utility gained *relative to the cost* of the good. For example, if both goods provided the same marginal utility (e.g., 10 utils), but product Y cost \u00a31 and product Z cost \u00a32, the consumer would gain more utility per pound by purchasing Y. They would continue to substitute Y for Z until the marginal utility per pound equalised, at which point MU_Y would be lower than MU_Z. Thus, simply equating marginal utilities does not lead to utility maximisation unless the prices happen to be identical.\n\n**B: when MU_Y \u00d7 P_Y = MU_Z \u00d7 P_Z**\nThis equation does not represent the consumer equilibrium condition. It incorrectly relates marginal utility and price. Following the logic of the Equimarginal Principle, a consumer is interested in the utility per unit of currency (MU/P), not the utility multiplied by the currency (MU x P). This formula has no economic basis for describing consumer choice and is inconsistent with the principle of utility maximisation.\n\n**D: it is not possible to tell from the information available**\nThis is incorrect because the information provided is precisely what is required to define the condition for consumer equilibrium.

A fundamental property of standard indifference curves is that they **cannot** intersect. If two indifference curves were to cross, it would violate the axiom of transitivity in consumer preferences.\n\n**Explanation of the Flaw:**\n*   **Transitivity** is a key assumption about consumer preferences, stating that if a consumer is indifferent between bundle A and bundle B, and also indifferent between bundle B and bundle C, then they must be indifferent between bundle A and bundle C.\n*   Let's assume two indifference curves, IC\u2081 and IC\u2082, intersect at point X. Let Y be another point on IC\u2081 and Z be another point on IC\u2082.\n*   By definition of an indifference curve, the consumer is indifferent between X and Y (as they are both on IC\u2081). Similarly, the consumer is indifferent between X and Z (as they are both on IC\u2082).\n*   According to the axiom of transitivity, if the consumer is indifferent between X and Y, and also between X and Z, they must be indifferent between Y and Z.\n*   However, Y and Z lie on two different indifference curves, which, by definition, represent different levels of utility. For instance, if IC\u2082 is a higher curve than IC\u2081, bundle Z must provide more utility than bundle Y. This contradicts the conclusion from transitivity that the consumer should be indifferent between Y and Z.\n*   Because an intersection leads to this logical contradiction, indifference curves cannot intersect.\n\n---\n### Explanation of Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Indifference curves are usually convex to the origin of the diagram.**\nThis statement is correct. The convexity of an indifference curve reflects the principle of the **diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS)**. The MRS is the rate at which a consumer is willing to give up a quantity of one good to obtain one more unit of another good, while maintaining the same level of utility. As a consumer moves down along an indifference curve, they possess more of the good on the horizontal axis and less of the good on the vertical axis. The diminishing MRS means that the consumer is willing to give up fewer and fewer units of the scarce good to obtain an additional unit of the abundant good. This changing trade-off results in a curve that bows inward toward the origin.\n\n**C. The consumer always prefers a higher indifference curve to a lower one.**\nThis statement is correct. It is based on the **axiom of non-satiation**, which assumes that \"more is better.\" A higher indifference curve (one that is further from the origin) represents combinations of goods that provide a higher level of total utility or satisfaction. Any bundle of goods on a higher curve contains more of at least one good, and no less of the other, compared to any bundle on a lower curve. Therefore, a rational consumer aiming to maximise utility will always prefer to be on the highest possible indifference curve.\n\n**D. The slope of the indifference curve represents the marginal rate of substitution.**\nThis statement is correct. The slope of the indifference curve at any given point measures the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade the good on the vertical axis for the good on the horizontal axis. This rate is precisely the definition of the **marginal rate of substitution (MRS)**. Since indifference curves are downward sloping, the slope is a negative value. The MRS is the absolute value of this slope (MRS = |\u0394Y/\u0394X|), representing the ratio of the marginal utility of the good on the horizontal axis to the marginal utility of the good on the vertical axis (MRS = MUx / MUy)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_303.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "3 a firm increases its production.\nwhen will this result in allocative efficiency?\na when the cost of producing the last extra unit equals the value the consumers place on it\nb_ when the cost of producing the last extra unit is at a minimum\nc_ when the total cost of production equals the value that consumers place on the total product\nd_ when the total revenue reaches a maximum", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAllocative efficiency is a state in an economy where production represents consumer preferences. Specifically, every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing it.\n\n\"The cost of producing the last extra unit\" is the definition of **Marginal Cost (MC)**. \"The value the consumers place on it\" refers to the **Marginal Benefit (MB)**, which is represented by the price (P) consumers are willing to pay for that last unit.\n\nTherefore, the condition for allocative efficiency is **P = MC**. This ensures that society's resources are allocated optimally. If P > MC, it means consumers value an additional unit more than it costs to produce, so output should be increased. If P < MC, the cost of the last unit exceeds its value to consumers, so output should be reduced. Allocative efficiency is achieved only when the production level is such that P = MC.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**B. when the cost of producing the last extra unit is at a minimum**\n\nThis describes the minimum point of the Marginal Cost (MC) curve. This point is significant as it indicates where diminishing marginal returns begin to set in, causing the cost of producing each additional unit to rise. However, this is not the condition for allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency (P = MC) can occur at any point along the upward-sloping portion of the MC curve, depending on the market price. Furthermore, this condition is also distinct from productive efficiency, which is achieved at the minimum point of the Average Total Cost (ATC) curve, not the MC curve.\n\n**C. when the total cost of production equals the value that consumers place on the total product**\n\nEconomic efficiency is determined by decisions made at the margin, not by comparing total values. Allocative efficiency requires comparing the cost and benefit of the *last* unit produced, not the sum of all units. It is possible for total value to equal total cost while the market is allocatively inefficient. For instance, a firm might have produced past the efficient point (where MC > P), destroying value on the final units produced, which could coincidentally lead to total cost equalling total value, while failing to maximize overall societal welfare.\n\n**D. when the total revenue reaches a maximum**\n\nA firm's total revenue is maximised at the level of output where Marginal Revenue (MR) is equal to zero. This is a specific business objective (revenue maximisation) and is not equivalent to allocative efficiency (P = MC). For any firm with market power that faces a downward-sloping demand curve, price is always greater than marginal revenue (P > MR).

The firm will continue to increase production.\n*   At an output of 3, MR (45) = MC (45). This is the profit-maximising level of output.\n*   At an output of 4, MR (25) < MC (95). Producing the fourth unit would reduce total profit.\n\nOnce the profit-maximising output (Q=3) is identified, we can calculate the total supernormal profit. Supernormal profit is the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC). It can be calculated using the formula: Total Profit = (Average Revenue (AR) - Average Total Cost (ATC)) \u00d7 Quantity (Q).\n\nAt an output of 3 units:\n*   Average Revenue (AR) = 85\n*   Average Total Cost (ATC) = 75\n*   Quantity (Q) = 3\n\nTotal Supernormal Profit = (85 - 75) \u00d7 3 = 10 \u00d7 3 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the firm's total supernormal profit at the profit-maximising level of output is 30.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. -15**\n\nThis value represents the firm's profit (in this case, a loss) at an output level of 1 unit. At this level, Average Revenue (125) is less than Average Total Cost (140), leading to a loss per unit of 15. The total loss is (125 - 140) \u00d7 1 = -15. However, this is not the profit-maximising level of output, as marginal revenue (125) significantly exceeds marginal cost (90), indicating that the firm can increase its profit by producing more. The question asks for the profit at the *profit-maximising* level.\n\n**B. 10**\n\nThis value represents the supernormal profit *per unit* (or average profit) at the profit-maximising output level of 3 units. It is calculated by subtracting the average total cost from the average revenue (AR - ATC = 85 - 75 = 10). However, the question asks for the *total* supernormal profit, which requires multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units produced (10 \u00d7 3 = 30).\n\n**D. 120**\n\nThis value is the result of an incorrect calculation. A possible error leading to this figure would be subtracting the marginal cost from the average revenue at the profit-maximising output level and then multiplying by the quantity: (AR - MC) \u00d7 Q = (85 - 45) \u00d7 3 = 40 \u00d7 3 = 120.

This occurs when average revenue (AR) equals average cost (AC).\n\nThis diagram correctly illustrates both conditions. The profit-maximising level of output (Qe) is determined by the intersection of the MC and MR curves. At this level of output, the AR curve is tangent to the AC curve. This tangency point shows that the price the firm receives (given by the AR curve) is exactly equal to the average cost of production. Therefore, the firm is maximising its profit while earning only normal profit, which is the defining characteristic of long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** This diagram shows a firm in a monopolistically competitive market earning supernormal profit. While the firm is producing at the profit-maximising output level where MC = MR, the price (AR) at this output is greater than the average cost (AC). The existence of supernormal profits would attract new firms to enter the market in the long run. This increased competition would cause the demand (AR) curve for this firm to shift leftwards until the supernormal profits are competed away. Thus, this represents a short-run, not a long-run, equilibrium.\n\n*   **B:** This diagram incorrectly identifies the firm's equilibrium output. The output level (Qe) is shown where the marginal cost (MC) curve intersects the average revenue (AR) curve. The condition for profit maximisation for a firm with a downward-sloping demand curve is to produce where MC = MR. Since the firm is not operating at its profit-maximising output, this cannot represent any form of equilibrium.\n\n*   **C:** This diagram depicts a firm in a monopolistically competitive market making a loss. The firm is shown to be producing at the profit-maximising (or loss-minimising) output level where MC = MR. However, at this output, the average cost (AC) is higher than the price (AR). In the long run, firms cannot sustain losses and would exit the market.

Cost-free exit implies that a firm leaving the industry can recover all of its costs, meaning there are no sunk costs. Sunk costs are expenditures that have been made and cannot be recovered if a firm ceases operations.\n\nIn reality, most businesses incur significant sunk costs. These include expenditure on highly specialised capital equipment that has little or no resale value, spending on advertising and brand development which is specific to the firm, or costs associated with employee training in firm-specific skills. Because these costs are irrecoverable, they represent a financial loss if the firm decides to exit the market. This potential loss acts as a barrier to exit, making the exit costly and thus violating a core condition of a perfectly contestable market.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: Firms in the industry all operate at the equilibrium level of output.**\nThis statement describes a potential outcome in a market that is highly contestable, rather than a reason why it is not perfectly contestable. The constant threat of 'hit-and-run' entry from new competitors forces incumbent firms to be highly efficient and to price competitively, often at a point where they earn only normal profits (Price = Average Cost). This is a form of equilibrium. Therefore, this describes a feature of a contestable market, not a barrier that makes it imperfect.\n\n**C: Large firms do not have to increase capital to grow.**\nThis statement is economically inaccurate. To achieve growth in output (i.e., to expand productive capacity), firms, regardless of their size, typically need to increase their stock of capital, such as machinery, technology, and premises. Furthermore, this point is not directly relevant to the costs of market entry and exit, which are the defining characteristics of contestability. The cost of exit relates to the recoverability of past capital investments, not the requirements for future growth.\n\n**D: Multinational companies always benefit from economies of scale.**\nWhile large firms like multinationals often achieve economies of scale, this is not always the case; they can also suffer from diseconomies of scale. More importantly, significant economies of scale act as a barrier to entry, making a market *less* contestable, because they give incumbent firms a cost advantage that potential entrants cannot easily match. However, the most direct reason why *exit* is not cost-free is the existence of sunk costs (unrecoverable fixed costs), which is precisely what option A describes.

On the diagram, the marginal revenue curve (MR) intersects the horizontal axis at point L, indicating that MR is zero at this quantity.\n\nA firm's objective of **sales maximisation** (also known as output maximisation) involves selling the highest possible quantity of output without making a loss.

On the diagram, the average revenue curve (AR) intersects the average cost curve (AC) at point K.

The development of relevant training facilities at a local college is a classic example. As an industry expands within a geographical area, educational institutions may respond by offering specialised courses. This creates a skilled labour pool that all firms in the industry can access, reducing their individual recruitment and training costs. The benefit is external to the firm, as it did not create the training facility, but it gains a cost advantage from its existence.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n*   **A: cheaper costs from purchasing large quantities of inputs**\n    This describes a purchasing economy of scale, which is a type of **internal** economy of scale. The cost advantage is gained by a single firm as it increases its own output and can therefore buy inputs in bulk, negotiating lower prices from suppliers. The benefit is internal to the firm and directly related to its own size, not the size of the industry.\n\n*   **B: decreased interest rates on borrowed funds**\n    This describes a financial economy of scale, which is also an **internal** economy of scale. As a firm grows larger and becomes more established, it is often considered more creditworthy and less risky by financial institutions. This allows it to borrow funds at a lower interest rate than smaller firms. This cost saving is specific to the individual firm's scale and reputation.\n\n*   **C: increased labour productivity**\n    This is an **effect** of economies of scale, not a type of economy of scale in itself. While increased labour productivity can be a result of external economies of scale (e.g., through access to a better-trained workforce as described in option D), it can also result from internal economies of scale (e.g., greater specialisation within a large factory).

Therefore, a four-firm concentration ratio of 25% indicates that the combined market share of the four largest firms in that industry is 25% of the total market.

This acts as a binding price floor. At this higher wage rate, the quantity of labour demanded by firms is determined by their demand curve (D). Following the demand curve up to the wage rate W\u2082 shows that firms are only willing and able to employ L\u2082 workers. Consequently, the level of employment falls from the initial equilibrium level of L\u2081 to the new level of L\u2082.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. fall from L\u2083 to L\u2082**\n\nThis is incorrect because the initial level of employment was not L\u2083. The starting point for employment is the market equilibrium, which is L\u2081. L\u2083 represents the quantity of labour that workers are willing to supply at the new, higher wage of W\u2082. It does not represent an actual level of employment, either initially or finally.\n\n**C. rise from L\u2081 to L\u2083**\n\nThis is incorrect because a wage increase leads to a fall, not a rise, in the quantity of labour demanded. The demand curve for labour is downward sloping, indicating that as the cost of labour (the wage rate) increases, firms will hire fewer workers. While the quantity of labour supplied increases from L\u2081 to L\u2083 at the higher wage W\u2082, the actual level of employment is determined by the quantity demanded by firms, which falls to L\u2082.\n\n**D. rise from L\u2082 to L\u2083**\n\nThis is incorrect for several reasons. Firstly, the initial level of employment was L\u2081, not L\u2082. Secondly, employment falls, it does not rise. Finally, the range from L\u2082 to L\u2083 does not represent a change in employment. Instead, it illustrates the extent of the excess supply of labour, or unemployment, created by the wage increase. At the wage W\u2082, the quantity of labour supplied is L\u2083, but the quantity demanded is only L\u2082, resulting in unemployment equal to the difference (L\u2083 - L\u2082)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_313.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "13 a firm buys new machinery which increases the marginal productivity of its workforce.\nwhat will be the resulting impact on the market for labour?\na _ashift to the left in the demand curve for labour\nb_ashift to the right in the demand curve for labour\nca shift to the left in the supply curve of labour\nd_ashift to the right in the supply curve of labour", "Chapter": 22, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct answer is **B**. The demand for labour by a firm is determined by the Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRP_L). This is the additional revenue a firm earns from employing one more worker. It is calculated as the Marginal Product of Labour (MP_L) multiplied by the Marginal Revenue (MR) from selling the output: MRP_L = MP_L \u00d7 MR.\n\nThe scenario states that the new machinery increases the marginal productivity of the workforce, meaning the MP_L rises. With a higher MP_L, each additional worker now contributes more to total output and, consequently, more to total revenue. This increases the MRP_L.\n\nSince the firm's demand curve for labour is its MRP_L curve, an increase in the MRP_L will cause the entire demand curve for labour to shift to the right. This indicates that at any given wage rate, the firm is now willing and able to employ more workers because they are more productive and generate more revenue.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: a shift to the left in the demand curve for labour**\nThis is incorrect. A leftward shift in the demand curve for labour would signify a decrease in the quantity of labour demanded at every wage rate. This would happen if the Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRP_L) decreased. A decrease in MRP_L would be caused by a fall in worker productivity (MP_L) or a fall in the price of the final good (MR). The question explicitly states that the new machinery *increases* the marginal productivity of the workforce, leading to an increase, not a decrease, in the demand for labour.\n\n**C: a shift to the left in the supply curve of labour**\nThis is incorrect. The supply of labour is determined by the decisions of individuals or households about how much they are willing to work at different wage rates. Factors that shift the market supply curve of labour include changes in the size of the working-age population, labour force participation rates, wages in alternative occupations, and non-monetary aspects of jobs. A firm purchasing new machinery is a factor that affects the *demand* for labour, not the aggregate supply of it. It does not reduce the number of people willing and able to work.\n\n**D: a shift to the right in the supply curve of labour**\nThis is incorrect. A rightward shift in the supply curve of labour would indicate that more workers are willing and able to work at any given wage rate. This could be caused by factors like immigration, an increase in the retirement age, or a decline in the attractiveness of leisure. The firm's investment in machinery does not directly influence these aggregate supply-side factors.

This results in a very high effective marginal tax rate, where disposable income (after-tax, after-benefit income) stagnates or even falls as gross pay rises.\n\nA combination of policies that decreases the individual's tax-free allowance and increases the proportion of means-tested benefits is most likely to strengthen the poverty trap.\n\n1.  **Decrease in the tax-free allowance:** A lower tax-free allowance means that workers will start paying income tax at a lower level of earnings. This increases their tax burden and reduces the net financial gain from any pay rise, thereby weakening the incentive to work more or seek higher pay.\n2.  **Increase in the proportion of means-tested benefits:** Means-tested benefits are withdrawn as an individual's income rises. Increasing the proportion of benefits that are means-tested means that a greater amount of state support is lost when a worker earns more. This withdrawal of benefits acts as an implicit tax, further reducing the increase in disposable income and strengthening the disincentive to earn more.\n\nThe combined effect of these two policies is to significantly increase the effective marginal tax rate on low-income earners, making it more likely that they will be caught in the poverty trap.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **B:** A decrease in the tax-free allowance would worsen the poverty trap. However, a decrease in the proportion of means-tested benefits would alleviate it. If fewer benefits are means-tested (i.e., more are universal), workers would retain more of their benefits as their earnings rise, strengthening the incentive to work. These two policies have opposing effects, so this combination is less likely to increase the poverty trap than combination A.\n*   **C:** An increase in the tax-free allowance would help workers escape the poverty trap by allowing them to earn more before paying tax, thus increasing their disposable income. While an increase in the proportion of means-tested benefits would worsen the trap, the two policies work in opposite directions. The net effect is ambiguous and certainly less likely to increase the trap than combination A.\n*   **D:** An increase in the individual's tax-free allowance is a policy designed to *reduce* the poverty trap by increasing the financial rewards from working. Keeping the proportion of means-tested benefits unchanged means there is no new policy-driven disincentive from the benefits system.

When unemployment benefits are relatively high (\"pay people not to work\") and income from employment is significantly reduced by taxes, the net financial gain from working may be small or even negative. In this scenario, an individual may rationally choose to remain unemployed because the value of their leisure time, subsidised by state benefits, exceeds the net wage they could earn from a job. This is known as **voluntary unemployment**, as the individual is able to find work at the prevailing wage rate but chooses not to accept it.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 2 (Involuntary Unemployment):**\n\nStatement 2 describes an individual who is willing and \"actively seeking work\" but is unable to find a job because of \"negative economic growth.\" Negative economic growth signifies a recession, a period in the economic cycle characterised by falling aggregate demand. As demand for goods and services falls, firms reduce production and consequently lay off workers or cease hiring. The resulting unemployment is **involuntary** because the individuals affected are unemployed against their will; they want to work at the current market wage rates but cannot find employment due to a macroeconomic-level shortage of jobs. This specific type of involuntary unemployment is also known as cyclical or demand-deficient unemployment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: cyclical, structural**\nThis option is incorrect. Statement 1 describes voluntary unemployment resulting from incentives, not **cyclical unemployment**, which is caused by a downturn in the business cycle. Statement 2 describes unemployment due to a general economic downturn (negative growth), which is cyclical in nature, not **structural unemployment**. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for available jobs, or a geographical mismatch, neither of which is mentioned.\n\n**B: voluntary, frictional**\nThis option is partially correct but ultimately flawed. While it correctly identifies the unemployment in Statement 1 as **voluntary**, it misidentifies the unemployment in Statement 2. **Frictional unemployment** is the temporary unemployment experienced by individuals who are between jobs or are new entrants to the labour market. The unemployment in Statement 2 is caused by a fundamental lack of jobs due to negative economic growth, not a short-term transition period.\n\n**C: structural, cyclical**\nThis option is incorrect. Statement 1 does not describe **structural unemployment**; it pertains to the choice not to work due to financial disincentives, not a skills or location mismatch.

Business confidence is low.**\n\nThis is the correct answer. Cutting the rate of interest is an expansionary monetary policy intended to stimulate aggregate demand (AD) by encouraging borrowing for consumption (C) and investment (I).\n\n*   **Consumption (C):** Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for consumers, making purchases of durable goods (like cars and appliances) on credit more attractive. They also reduce the reward for saving, incentivising spending instead.\n*   **Investment (I):** Lower interest rates reduce the cost of capital for firms, making more investment projects profitable and thereby encouraging firms to borrow and invest in new machinery, technology, and buildings.\n\nHowever, during a recession, both consumer and business confidence are typically very low.\n*   **Low Business Confidence:** Firms may be pessimistic about future sales and profitability. Even if borrowing is cheap, they will not invest if they do not expect to be able to sell the extra output produced. They will choose to pay down debt or build up cash reserves rather than expand.\n*   **Low Consumer Confidence:** Consumers may be worried about job security and future income. Even with low interest rates, they may be unwilling to take on new debt and instead increase their precautionary savings.\n\nIn such a scenario, the lower interest rates fail to translate into higher spending and investment. This situation is sometimes described as \"pushing on a string,\" where monetary policy becomes ineffective because the key economic agents are unresponsive to the incentive of cheaper credit due to negative expectations.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**B. It leads to deflation.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A cut in the interest rate is an expansionary policy designed to increase aggregate demand. An increase in aggregate demand, all else being equal, puts upward pressure on the price level, leading to inflation (or a reduction in deflationary pressure). Deflation (a sustained fall in the general price level) is a symptom of a deep recession caused by a significant fall in aggregate demand, which is the very problem the interest rate cut is trying to combat. The policy itself does not cause deflation; rather, it aims to prevent or reverse it.\n\n**C. It leads to an appreciation in the exchange rate.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A cut in the domestic interest rate makes financial assets in that country less attractive to foreign investors compared to assets in other countries, as the rate of return is now lower. This leads to an outflow of financial capital (hot money). To move their funds elsewhere, investors sell the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market, increasing its supply. An increase in the supply of a currency causes its value to fall, leading to a **depreciation**, not an appreciation, of the exchange rate. A depreciation would actually help stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thus boosting net exports (X-M).\n\n**D. It leads to a decrease in the money supply.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Cutting the policy interest rate is a form of expansionary monetary policy. The central bank's goal is to encourage commercial banks to lend more and to stimulate borrowing by firms and households. This process, known as credit creation, leads to an **increase**, not a decrease, in the broad money supply. While the central bank does not directly control the entire money supply, its policy actions are designed to influence it in an expansionary direction to achieve its goals of higher demand and employment. A decrease in the money supply would be associated with contractionary monetary policy (i.e., raising interest rates)."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_319.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "19 households in an economy change their consumption behaviour causing the consumption curve\nto shift from c,; to co.\ncy\nconsumption\nspending c,\nfe) \" \u2018\ndisposable income\nwhat has happened to autonomous consumption and the marginal propensity to consume?\nautonomous marginal propensity\nconsumption to consume\na decreased decreased\nb decreased increased\ncc increased decreased\nd increased increased", "Chapter": 23, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (C)\n\nThe consumption function is represented by the equation C = a + bYd, where 'a' is autonomous consumption and 'b' is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).\n\n*   **Autonomous consumption (a)** is the level of consumption spending when disposable income is zero. Graphically, it is the y-intercept of the consumption curve. In the shift from curve C\u2081 to C\u2082, the y-intercept has moved higher up the vertical axis.

The y-intercept of the new consumption curve, C\u2082, is higher than the y-intercept of the original curve, C\u2081, indicating that households are spending more even with zero disposable income.

When the central bank reduces its main policy rate, commercial banks typically lower their own lending rates. This directly reduces the cost of borrowing for businesses. With cheaper access to credit, firms are more likely to take out loans to finance investment projects, such as buying new machinery, building new factories, or expanding their operations. This increase in investment spending is a component of Aggregate Demand (AD). A rightward shift in the AD curve leads to an increase in real output (real GDP), prompting firms to hire more workers to meet the higher demand, thereby reducing cyclical unemployment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** While lower interest rates do reduce the cost for a government to service its national debt, this is not the primary or most direct way that this policy reduces unemployment. The main transmission mechanism of lower interest rates is the stimulation of private sector spending and investment. The impact on the budget deficit is a secondary effect and may be counteracted by other factors; for example, during a recession, tax revenues might fall and welfare payments might rise, potentially worsening the deficit even as interest costs fall.\n\n**C:** A decrease in domestic interest rates is most likely to cause the foreign exchange rate of the currency to *decrease* (depreciate), not increase. Lower interest rates make holding that country's currency less attractive for foreign investors seeking higher returns on their capital. This reduces the demand for the currency and encourages an outflow of 'hot money', increasing its supply on foreign exchange markets. Both effects put downward pressure on the currency's value. The premise of this option is, therefore, contrary to standard economic theory.\n\n**D:** The opportunity cost of spending is the benefit forgone by not saving, which is typically the interest that could have been earned. When interest rates are decreased, the return on saving falls. This *decreases*, rather than increases, the opportunity cost of spending. A lower opportunity cost incentivises consumers to spend more and save less, which boosts consumption\u2014a major component of Aggregate Demand\u2014and helps to reduce unemployment.

This trade-off is considered a short-run phenomenon because it breaks down once people's expectations of inflation adjust. Initially, an increase in aggregate demand can lead to higher inflation and lower unemployment. However, once workers and firms begin to experience this higher inflation, they will anticipate it continuing. These inflationary expectations are then built into wage negotiations and price-setting behaviour. Workers demand higher nominal wages to maintain their real wages, and firms, anticipating rising costs, raise their prices. This process shifts the short-run Phillips curve upwards, meaning that any given level of unemployment is now associated with a higher rate of inflation. The economy returns to its natural rate of unemployment, but at a permanently higher inflation rate, thus eliminating the long-run trade-off.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: Any attempt to reduce unemployment will increase inflation.**\nThis statement is a description of the relationship shown by the short-run Phillips curve itself, not an explanation for why the relationship is only temporary. It correctly identifies the trade-off inherent in moving along the curve (i.e., lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation), but it does not address the underlying economic reasons why this trade-off is not sustainable in the long run.\n\n**B: Increased inflation actually increases unemployment.**\nThis statement describes stagflation, a situation where both inflation and unemployment are high. This represents a rightward shift of the short-run Phillips curve, which is indeed what happens when the initial trade-off breaks down due to adverse supply shocks or rising inflationary expectations. However, this is a consequence of the breakdown, not the fundamental cause. The primary reason for the shift and the instability of the curve is the adjustment of expectations, as outlined in option C.\n\n**D: Increased inflation reduces real wage rates, which increases the demand for labour.**\nThis statement accurately explains the mechanism that causes the movement *along* the short-run Phillips curve. When inflation is unexpectedly high, nominal wages lag behind the increase in the price level, causing real wages to fall. This reduction in the real cost of labour incentivises firms to hire more workers, thus reducing unemployment. However, this only explains the short-run effect. It fails to explain why this situation is not permanent. The relationship is temporary because workers eventually realise their real wages have fallen and adjust their wage demands upwards in line with their new expectations of inflation, neutralising the initial effect on unemployment."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_322.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "22 what is the most likely result of a period of negative actual growth?\na anincrease in the surplus of the financial account of the balance of payments\nb_anincrease in the deficit of the current account of the balance of payments\nc_anincrease in the rate of inflation\nd_anincrease in the rate of unemployment", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA period of negative actual growth, also known as an economic recession, signifies a decrease in the economy's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As the total output of goods and services falls, firms require less labour to meet the reduced demand. Labour is a derived demand, meaning the demand for workers is dependent on the demand for the products they produce. Consequently, firms will reduce hiring and may lay off existing workers to cut costs. This leads directly to a rise in cyclical (or demand-deficient) unemployment. This inverse relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an increase in the surplus of the financial account of the balance of payments**\n\nThis outcome is unlikely. During a period of negative growth, national income falls, which typically leads to a reduction in spending on imported goods and services. This improves the current account balance (e.g., a smaller deficit or larger surplus). According to the balance of payments identity, an improvement in the current account is generally matched by a worsening of the financial account (a smaller surplus or larger deficit). Furthermore, to combat the recession, the central bank might lower interest rates, which can lead to capital outflow as investors seek higher returns elsewhere, further contributing to a deficit in the financial account, not an increased surplus.\n\n**B. an increase in the deficit of the current account of the balance of payments**\n\nThis is the opposite of the most likely outcome. Negative actual growth means that national income is falling. Since a portion of a country's income is spent on imports, a fall in national income leads to a decrease in the demand for imported goods and services. A reduction in import expenditure, with exports remaining constant or falling less sharply, will improve the balance of the current account. This means the current account deficit would decrease, or a surplus would increase. Therefore, an increase in the deficit is not a likely result.\n\n**C. an increase in the rate of inflation**\n\nNegative actual growth is most commonly associated with a decrease in aggregate demand. A fall in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve to the left, leading to a lower equilibrium price level and lower real output. A fall in the general price level results in a lower rate of inflation (disinflation) or even deflation (a negative rate of inflation). An increase in the rate of inflation would only occur alongside negative growth in a scenario of stagflation, which is caused by a negative supply-side shock (e.g., a sharp rise in oil prices).

The effectiveness of this policy depends on how responsive the components of AD, particularly consumption (C) and investment (I), are to changes in the interest rate.\n\nInvestment refers to spending by firms on capital goods. \"Interest rate elastic\" means that investment spending is highly responsive to changes in the interest rate. If investment is interest rate elastic, a reduction in the interest rate will lead to a proportionally larger increase in spending by firms on capital goods. This significant rise in investment provides a strong initial injection into the circular flow of income, causing a substantial rightward shift in the AD curve. This directly addresses the problem of falling incomes and rising unemployment, making the policy most likely to succeed.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. when spending by consumers on goods and services is income elastic**\n\nThis condition describes the relationship between consumer spending and income, not the interest rate. The policy tool being used is a reduction in the interest rate. While a successful policy would eventually lead to rising incomes, this option does not explain the initial effectiveness of the interest rate cut itself. Furthermore, in the initial situation of falling incomes, income-elastic consumption would mean that consumer spending is falling at a faster rate than income, which would actually worsen the economic downturn, not help the policy succeed.\n\n**C. when the leakage on additional national income is high**\n\nLeakages (or withdrawals) from the circular flow of income include savings, taxes, and imports. The size of the national income multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to withdraw (the proportion of any additional income that is leaked). A high leakage means the multiplier is small. A small multiplier will dampen the effect of any initial increase in spending (such as from investment), meaning the final increase in national income will be smaller. Therefore, high leakages would make the policy *less* effective, not more.\n\n**D. when the overseas demand for exports is price inelastic**\n\nA reduction in the domestic interest rate can lead to an outflow of 'hot money', causing the exchange rate to depreciate. A depreciation makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers. However, if the demand for these exports is price inelastic, the percentage increase in the quantity demanded will be smaller than the percentage decrease in their price. This would lead to a fall in total export revenue, which would reduce, rather than increase, aggregate demand.

The focus is on the speed and the domestic nature of the policy's effects.\n\nThe time it takes for the foreign exchange rate to respond to the policy is the least concern. The primary goal is a *domestic* impact, which relates to influencing domestic consumption, investment, and employment. The exchange rate channel is an *external* transmission mechanism. While a change in the exchange rate does affect the domestic economy through net exports (the price of exports and imports), it is a less direct channel than the impact on domestic borrowing costs and investment. Therefore, a delay in this external channel is of secondary importance compared to the lags that directly affect the domestic economy.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: the time it takes for policymakers to recognise the cause of a problem**\n\nThis is known as the **recognition lag**. It is a major concern because no policy action can be taken until the problem (e.g., rising inflation or a recession) is identified from economic data, which is often published with a delay. A long recognition lag directly prevents a rapid response, making it a significant concern.\n\n**B: the time it takes for the economy to respond to the introduction of the policy**\n\nThis is the **impact lag** (or transmission lag). This is arguably the most significant concern for a government wanting a rapid impact. Monetary policy works with long and variable lags; for instance, a change in the policy interest rate can take 18-24 months to have its full effect on inflation and output. This is because it takes time for changes in interest rates to influence consumer spending and business investment decisions. A long impact lag is the primary reason monetary policy is not a tool for rapid, short-term economic management.\n\n**D: the time it takes to put the chosen policy measure into place**\n\nThis is the **implementation lag**. This represents the delay between deciding on a policy change and executing it. While the implementation lag for monetary policy is very short (a central bank can change interest rates almost immediately after a meeting), any delay is still a concern for a government that prioritises speed. It is a more fundamental step than the exchange rate response, as the policy must be implemented before any of its effects can be realised.

The diagram illustrates that from Year 1 to Year 2, the entire curve has shifted upwards, meaning that for any given population size, the output per head is now higher. This upward shift must be caused by a change in a factor other than population itself, which is treated as the independent variable on the horizontal axis. An increase in population, with all other factors held constant, would cause a movement along the Year 1 curve, which after the optimum point (P1) would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in output per head.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **B. State of technology has improved:** An improvement in the state of technology would raise the productivity of a nation's resources, including labour. This means more output can be produced with the same amount of inputs. For any given population size, total output would increase, leading to a higher output per head. This would cause the entire \"output per head\" curve to shift upwards, which is consistent with the change from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n*   **C. Stock of capital has increased:** An increase in the stock of capital (e.g., more machinery, factories, and infrastructure) means that the labour force has more capital to work with. This process, known as capital deepening, increases labour productivity. As each worker can produce more, the total output for any given population size rises, resulting in a higher output per head and an upward shift of the curve.\n\n*   **D. Volume of productive resources in use has increased:** This is a general statement that encompasses factors such as the discovery of new natural resources or an increase in the stock of capital. An increase in the quantity or quality of productive resources available to an economy expands its productive capacity. This allows for a greater total output to be generated at any given population level, thereby increasing output per head and shifting the curve upwards from the Year 1 position to the Year 2 position."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_326.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "26 a government wants to reduce the current account deficit on the balance of payments.\nwhat is an example of an expenditure-reducing policy?\na adevaluation of the currency\nbasubsidy on domestic production\nc sa tariff on imports\nd_anincrease in income taxes", "Chapter": 28, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn increase in income taxes is an example of an **expenditure-reducing policy**. These policies, also known as deflationary policies, aim to reduce a current account deficit by lowering the overall level of aggregate demand (AD) in the economy. An increase in income tax reduces the disposable income of households, leading to a decrease in consumption spending. As overall expenditure in the economy falls, the demand for all goods and services, including imports, decreases. This reduction in import spending (M) helps to narrow the current account deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. A devaluation of the currency:** This is an **expenditure-switching policy**, not an expenditure-reducing one. Devaluation lowers the external value of a country's currency, making its exports cheaper for foreign buyers and its imports more expensive for domestic consumers. The policy's goal is to encourage both domestic and foreign consumers to switch their spending from foreign goods to domestically produced goods. This aims to increase export revenue (X) and decrease import expenditure (M), but it does not directly reduce the overall level of spending in the economy.\n\n**B. A subsidy on domestic production:** This is an **expenditure-switching policy**. By providing a subsidy, the government lowers the production costs for domestic firms, which can lead to lower prices for their goods. This makes domestic products more price-competitive against imports, encouraging consumers to switch their spending to domestic alternatives. The primary mechanism is altering relative prices, not reducing total national expenditure.\n\n**C. A tariff on imports:** This is a classic example of an **expenditure-switching policy**. A tariff is a tax placed on imported goods, which raises their price for domestic consumers. This makes domestically produced substitutes relatively cheaper, incentivising consumers to switch their purchases away from imports and towards domestic goods. The policy works by changing the pattern of expenditure, rather than reducing its overall level."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_327.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "27 during a year, a country\u2019s national income in money terms increased by 5%, prices increased by\n4% and the total population increased by 2%.\nwhat was the approximate change in real income per head?\na adecrease of 1%\nb  adecrease of 2%\nc_ anincrease of 1%\nd_anincrease of 2%", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe change in real income per head (or per capita) is calculated by adjusting the change in national income in money terms (nominal national income) for both the rate of price increases (inflation) and the rate of population growth.\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in real national income:** Real income growth is found by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal income growth.\n    *   Percentage change in real national income \u2248 Percentage change in nominal national income - Inflation rate\n    *   Percentage change in real national income \u2248 5% - 4% = 1%\n    This means the country's total purchasing power grew by approximately 1%.\n\n2.  **Calculate the change in real income per head:** This 1% growth in total real income must be shared among the population.

However, the real national income grew by 1% (5% nominal growth - 4% inflation). This option incorrectly ignores the positive growth in real national income.\n\n**C. an increase of 1%**\nThis figure (1%) represents the growth in the country's *total* real national income (5% nominal income growth - 4% inflation). This calculation correctly accounts for the effect of rising prices but fails to account for the 2% increase in population. As the total real income must be distributed among a larger population, the average income per person cannot rise by this amount; it must be lower.\n\n**D. an increase of 2%**\nThis figure represents the rate of population growth, not the change in real income per head. Arriving at this answer would involve an incorrect calculation, as it fails to properly incorporate the changes in nominal income and prices.

This injection of capital typically leads to the creation of new production facilities or the expansion of existing ones. A primary consequence of this increased productive capacity is an improvement in the host country's trade balance. This occurs through two main channels:\n1.  **Export Promotion:** The goods produced by the foreign-owned firm are often destined for international markets, thereby increasing the value of the host country's exports.\n2.  **Import Substitution:** The newly established firms may produce goods that the host country was previously importing. This reduces the need for imports, lowering the country's import expenditure.\nBoth increased exports and decreased imports contribute to an improvement in the trade balance, which is a key component of the current account of the balance of payments.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. an increase in the developing economy's net investment income**\nThis is incorrect. Net investment income (or primary income) on the current account records the difference between income earned by residents from their foreign assets and income paid to non-residents on their domestic assets. FDI represents foreign ownership of domestic assets. The profits generated by these assets, when repatriated to the foreign parent company, constitute an income outflow for the developing economy (a debit on the primary income account). Therefore, FDI is likely to lead to a *decrease* or a worsening of the net investment income balance, not an increase.\n\n**C. a reduction in the developing economy's government tax revenue**\nThis is incorrect. Foreign firms operating within a developing economy are typically subject to corporation tax on their profits, which directly increases government tax revenue. Furthermore, FDI creates jobs, leading to higher income tax receipts from newly employed workers. The overall increase in economic activity can also boost revenue from indirect taxes, such as VAT or sales taxes. While some governments may offer temporary tax incentives or holidays to attract FDI, the overall net effect on tax revenue is almost certainly positive due to the expanded tax base.\n\n**D. a reduction in wage levels in the developing economy**\nThis is incorrect. FDI increases the demand for labour in the host country as new firms seek to hire workers. According to the principles of supply and demand in the labour market, an increase in the demand for labour will, ceteris paribus, put upward pressure on wage levels. Multinational corporations (MNCs) that undertake FDI often pay wages that are at or above the prevailing local market rate to attract and retain skilled labour, further contributing to a rise, not a fall, in average wages."}, {"questionName": "A_eco_p3_329.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9708_w24_qp_33.pdf", "questionText": "29 the diagram shows an economy\u2019s lorenz curve (vw).\n100 qw\n45\u00b0\u201d\ncumulative % ae\nof income we\nra area y\nye\n0 100\ncumulative % of population\nhow is the gini coefficient for the economy calculated?\n\u00a5 y z. z\na \u2014s bos \u20ac & \u2014\ny+z z y y+z", "Chapter": 29, "Level": "A2", "paperNumber": 3, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe Gini coefficient is a standard measure of income inequality. It is derived from the Lorenz curve diagram by calculating the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of perfect equality.\n\nIn the provided diagram:\n-   **Area Y** represents the area between the line of perfect equality (the 45-degree line) and the Lorenz curve. This area quantifies the extent of income inequality.\n-   The total area under the line of perfect equality is the area of the triangle formed by the origin (0,0), the point (100,0), and the point W (100,100). This total area is the sum of **Area Y** and **Area Z**.\n\nTherefore, the Gini coefficient is calculated as:\nGini Coefficient = (Area of inequality) / (Total area under the line of perfect equality) = **Y / (Y + Z)**\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: Y / Z\n\nThis option represents the ratio of the area of inequality (Y) to the area under the Lorenz curve (Z). The correct definition of the Gini coefficient requires the denominator to be the total area under the line of perfect equality (Y + Z), not just the area under the Lorenz curve. This ratio does not represent the Gini coefficient.\n\n#### C: Z / Y\n\nThis option represents the ratio of the area under the Lorenz curve (Z) to the area of inequality (Y). This is the inverse of the ratio in option B and has no standard economic interpretation as a measure of income distribution.

This ratio actually measures the degree of income *equality*, not inequality.

Since the Gini coefficient measures inequality, this option is incorrect."}]
