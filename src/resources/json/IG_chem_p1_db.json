The H\u2082O molecules in ice are able to vibrate.**\n\nThis statement is correct. According to the kinetic particle theory, particles in all states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) possess kinetic energy and are in constant motion. In a solid like ice, the water molecules are held in fixed positions within a regular, crystalline lattice structure by strong intermolecular forces. Although they cannot move from place to place (translation), they do have kinetic energy, which causes them to continuously vibrate about these fixed positions. The higher the temperature of the solid, the more vigorously the particles vibrate.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The H\u2082O molecules are on average closest together in steam.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Steam is the gaseous state of water. In the gaseous state, particles have a high amount of kinetic energy, which is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between them. As a result, the molecules move randomly and rapidly, and are, on average, very far apart from one another. Particles in liquids and solids are much more closely packed. Therefore, H\u2082O molecules are, on average, furthest apart in steam, not closest together.\n\n**B. The H\u2082O molecules are on average furthest apart in water.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While water has a unique property where its solid form (ice) is less dense than its liquid form, the molecules in both the solid and liquid states are still much closer together than in the gaseous state (steam). In steam, the molecules are separated by large distances and move freely. Thus, the H\u2082O molecules are furthest apart in steam, not in liquid water.\n\n**C. The H\u2082O molecules in steam have the second highest average velocity.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the velocity (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2), the state with the highest temperature will have particles with the highest average velocity. Of the three states, steam exists at the highest temperatures (\u2265100\u00b0C), followed by liquid water (0\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C), and then ice (\u22640\u00b0C). Consequently, H\u2082O molecules in steam possess the highest average kinetic energy and therefore the highest average velocity."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_2.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 the melting points and boiling points of three elements, at 1 atm pressure, are shown.\nmelting point boiling point\n\u00b0c \u00b0c\nargon -189 -186\nnitrogen -210 -196\noxygen \u2014218 -183\nseparate samples of argon, nitrogen and oxygen are stored at \u2014200\u00b0c and at 1 atm pressure.\nhow many samples are liquids?\na 0 b 1 cc 2 d 3", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe state of a substance at a given temperature is determined by its melting and boiling points. A substance is a liquid if the temperature is above its melting point but below its boiling point. The state of each element at -200 \u00b0C must be determined.\n\n*   **Argon:** The melting point is -189 \u00b0C. Since -200 \u00b0C is lower than -189 \u00b0C, argon is below its melting point and is therefore in the **solid** state.\n*   **Nitrogen:** The melting point is -210 \u00b0C and the boiling point is -196 \u00b0C. The temperature -200 \u00b0C is higher than the melting point (-210 \u00b0C) but lower than the boiling point (-196 \u00b0C). Therefore, nitrogen is in the **liquid** state.\n*   **Oxygen:** The melting point is -218 \u00b0C and the boiling point is -183 \u00b0C. The temperature -200 \u00b0C is higher than the melting point (-218 \u00b0C) but lower than the boiling point (-183 \u00b0C). Therefore, oxygen is in the **liquid** state.\n\nBased on this analysis, two of the elements, nitrogen and oxygen, are liquids at -200 \u00b0C.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) 0:** This is incorrect. For this to be correct, all three elements would need to be either solids or gases at -200 \u00b0C. However, both nitrogen and oxygen are in their liquid state at this temperature because -200 \u00b0C falls between their respective melting and boiling points.\n\n**B) 1:** This is incorrect. While the analysis shows that at least one substance is a liquid, a full analysis reveals that two substances are liquids. This answer might be chosen if one of the liquids was misidentified. For example, if it was incorrectly concluded that oxygen was still a solid or that nitrogen had already boiled into a gas at -200 \u00b0C.\n\n**D) 3:** This is incorrect. For all three samples to be liquids, the temperature of -200 \u00b0C would need to be between the melting and boiling points for all three elements. However, argon has a melting point of -189 \u00b0C. As -200 \u00b0C is below this temperature, argon is a solid, not a liquid."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_3.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "3 which statement describes a compound?\na it contains two or more elements chemically combined.\nb__ it contains two or more elements physically combined.\nc_ it contains two or more elements forming an alloy.\nd_ it contains two or more elements that can easily be separated.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nA compound is a pure substance formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. The process of chemical combination involves the formation of new chemical bonds, resulting in a new substance with properties that are distinct from its constituent elements. For example, water (H\u2082O) is a compound formed from the chemical combination of hydrogen and oxygen. Its properties (a liquid at room temperature) are completely different from those of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. This statement accurately provides the scientific definition of a compound.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. It contains two or more elements physically combined.**\nThis statement describes a mixture, not a compound. In a mixture, substances are physically combined without any chemical reaction occurring. The individual components retain their own chemical identities and properties. For example, mixing sand and sugar creates a mixture where both sand and sugar particles are present but not chemically altered.\n\n**C. It contains two or more elements forming an alloy.**\nAn alloy is a specific type of mixture, typically composed of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-metal. While alloys involve combining elements, they are classified as mixtures (specifically, solid solutions) because the elements are not typically bonded in a fixed, definite whole-number ratio as they are in a compound. This statement describes a specific class of materials (alloys), which are a type of mixture, not the general definition of a compound.\n\n**D. It contains two or more elements that can easily be separated.**\nThis statement describes a characteristic property of a mixture. The components of a mixture can be separated by physical means, such as filtration, evaporation, or magnetism, which do not involve breaking chemical bonds. In contrast, the elements within a compound are chemically bonded and can only be separated by a chemical reaction, which requires a significant amount of energy. Therefore, the elements in a compound are not easily separated."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_4.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 which statement about elements in the periodic table is correct?\na_ apotassium ion, k\u2019, has the same electronic configuration as a chloride ion, cl.\nb_ the electronic configuration of a ca** ion is 2,8,8,2.\nc_ the halogens are in group vi and so their atoms have six electrons in their outer shell.\nd magnesium is in period 3 and so a magnesium ion, mg\", has three occupied electron shells.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA potassium atom (K), with atomic number 19, has an electronic configuration of 2,8,8,1. To form a stable potassium ion (K\u207a), it loses the single electron from its outermost shell. The resulting K\u207a ion has 18 electrons and an electronic configuration of 2,8,8.\n\nA chlorine atom (Cl), with atomic number 17, has an electronic configuration of 2,8,7. To form a stable chloride ion (Cl\u207b), it gains one electron to complete its outermost shell. The resulting Cl\u207b ion has 18 electrons and an electronic configuration of 2,8,8.\n\nTherefore, both the K\u207a ion and the Cl\u207b ion have the same stable electronic configuration of 2,8,8, which is isoelectronic with the noble gas Argon.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. The electronic configuration of a Ca\u00b2\u207a ion is 2,8,8,2.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The electronic configuration 2,8,8,2 belongs to a neutral calcium atom (Ca), which has 20 protons and 20 electrons. To form a calcium ion (Ca\u00b2\u207a), the atom loses the two electrons from its outermost shell to achieve a stable electron arrangement. The resulting Ca\u00b2\u207a ion has 18 electrons, and its correct electronic configuration is 2,8,8.\n\n**C. The halogens are in Group VI and so their atoms have six electrons in their outer shell.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The halogens (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine) are the elements in Group VII (or Group 17) of the Periodic Table. A key property of elements in a group is that they have the same number of valence electrons. Therefore, halogen atoms have seven electrons in their outer shell, not six. Elements in Group VI (the chalcogens, e.g., oxygen, sulfur) are the ones that have six electrons in their outer shell.\n\n**D. Magnesium is in Period 3 and so a magnesium ion, Mg\u00b2\u207a, has three occupied electron shells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A neutral magnesium atom (Mg) is in Period 3 and does have three occupied electron shells, with the configuration 2,8,2. However, to form a stable magnesium ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a), the atom loses the two electrons from its third and outermost shell. The resulting Mg\u00b2\u207a ion has the electronic configuration 2,8. Consequently, the Mg\u00b2\u207a ion has only two occupied electron shells, as the third shell is now empty."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_5.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 which statement about ions and ionic bonds is correct?\na_ bromine atoms form negatively charged bromide ions.\nb__lonic bonds form between elements in group vii of the periodic table.\nc_ positive ions are formed when atoms lose protons.\nd_ potassium iodide contains negatively charged potassium ions.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nBromine is an element in Group VII of the Periodic Table, also known as the halogens. Atoms of elements in this group have seven electrons in their outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, similar to that of a noble gas (with a full outer shell), a bromine atom will gain one electron. Since electrons are negatively charged particles, gaining an electron results in the formation of an ion with a net negative charge of -1. This negatively charged ion is called a bromide ion (Br\u207b).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Ionic bonds form between elements in Group VII of the Periodic Table.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Ionic bonds are formed through the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, which typically involves the transfer of electrons from a metal atom to a non-metal atom. Elements in Group VII are all non-metals. When two non-metal atoms bond together, they achieve stable electron configurations by sharing electrons, which forms a covalent bond, not an ionic bond. For example, two chlorine atoms (both in Group VII) will form a Cl\u2082 molecule via a single covalent bond.\n\n**C. Positive ions are formed when atoms lose protons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An atom's identity is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus; losing or gaining protons would change the element itself, which is a nuclear reaction, not a chemical one. Ions are formed when atoms lose or gain electrons. A positive ion, known as a cation, is formed when a neutral atom loses one or more of its negatively charged electrons. This results in the atom having more protons (positive charge) than electrons (negative charge), giving it an overall positive charge.\n\n**D. Potassium iodide contains negatively charged potassium ions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Potassium (K) is an alkali metal in Group I of the Periodic Table. Atoms of Group I elements have one valence electron, which they readily lose to form a stable ion. When a potassium atom loses its single valence electron, it becomes a positively charged ion (K\u207a). In the compound potassium iodide (KI), the potassium atom transfers its electron to an iodine atom, forming a positive potassium ion (K\u207a) and a negative iodide ion (I\u207b)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_6.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "6 which molecule has only two shared pairs of electrons?\na ch, b cl, c hcl d h2,0", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA water molecule (H\u2082O) consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen is in Group 16 of the periodic table and has six valence electrons. It requires two more electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration (a full outer shell of eight electrons). Hydrogen is in Group 1 and has one valence electron; it requires one more electron to achieve a stable configuration.\n\nIn the H\u2082O molecule, the oxygen atom forms a single covalent bond with each of the two hydrogen atoms. Each single covalent bond consists of one shared pair of electrons. Therefore, the water molecule contains a total of two shared pairs of electrons (one pair for each O-H bond).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. CH\u2084**\n\nA methane molecule (CH\u2084) consists of a central carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Carbon, being in Group 14, has four valence electrons and needs to form four covalent bonds to achieve a stable octet. Each hydrogen atom has one valence electron and needs to form one covalent bond. The carbon atom forms a single covalent bond with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Since each single bond represents one shared pair of electrons, a methane molecule has a total of four shared pairs of electrons.\n\n**B. Cl\u2082**\n\nA chlorine molecule (Cl\u2082) consists of two chlorine atoms. Chlorine is in Group 17 and has seven valence electrons. To achieve a stable octet, each chlorine atom needs to gain one electron. The two chlorine atoms form a single covalent bond by sharing one pair of electrons between them. Therefore, a chlorine molecule has only one shared pair of electrons.\n\n**C. HCl**\n\nA hydrogen chloride molecule (HCl) consists of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom. Hydrogen has one valence electron, and chlorine has seven. To achieve stable electron configurations, the hydrogen atom and the chlorine atom share one pair of electrons, forming a single covalent bond.

Electrical conductivity in a substance requires the presence of mobile charge carriers. In graphite, each carbon atom forms three strong covalent bonds with neighbouring carbon atoms in a layered, hexagonal arrangement. This leaves one outer shell (valence) electron per carbon atom that is not involved in a localised covalent bond. This fourth electron is delocalised and is free to move along the layers of the graphite structure. The flow of these mobile, delocalised electrons constitutes an electric current, allowing graphite to conduct electricity. This property, along with its high melting point and chemical inertness, makes graphite an excellent material for electrodes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It contains ions.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Graphite is an element, an allotrope of carbon. Its structure consists of neutral carbon atoms joined by strong covalent bonds. It does not contain ions (charged atoms or molecules). Electrical conduction can occur via the movement of mobile ions, but this happens in substances like molten ionic compounds or aqueous ionic solutions, not in solid graphite.\n\n**B. It has a giant covalent structure.**\n\nWhile it is true that graphite has a giant covalent structure, this property by itself does not explain why it can be used as an electrode. Many substances with giant covalent structures, such as diamond and silicon dioxide, are electrical insulators. In diamond, for example, every carbon atom uses all four of its valence electrons to form four strong covalent bonds, leaving no mobile electrons to carry a current. Therefore, simply having a giant covalent structure is not sufficient to explain electrical conductivity. The specific arrangement of atoms and electrons within that structure is what matters.\n\n**C. It is a metal.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Graphite is a non-metal, as it is an allotrope of the element carbon. Although it exhibits some properties typically associated with metals, such as electrical conductivity and lustre, its fundamental structure and bonding are characteristic of a non-metal. Metals consist of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a \"sea\" of delocalised electrons, whereas graphite consists of neutral carbon atoms covalently bonded in layers."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_8.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 methane, ch,, burns in air to form carbon dioxide and water.\nwhat is the balanced equation for this reaction?\na cha(g) + o2(g) > co2(g) + 2h20(g)\nb  cha(g) + 202(9) > co2(g) + 2h20(g)\nc ch,(g) + 202(g) > co2(g) + h20(g)\nd cha(g) + 302(9) > co2(g) + 2h20(g)", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe reaction described is the complete combustion of methane (CH\u2084) in oxygen (O\u2082) to produce carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O).

Anions (negative ions) are attracted to the anode, where they lose electrons in a process called oxidation.\n\nIn aqueous sodium chloride, the anions present are chloride ions (Cl\u207b) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b). For halide solutions (except fluoride), the halide ion is preferentially discharged over the hydroxide ion, especially if the solution is concentrated. Therefore, chloride ions are oxidized to form chlorine gas at the anode.\n\nThe half-equation for the reaction at the anode is:\n2Cl\u207b(aq) \u2192 Cl\u2082(g) + 2e\u207b\n\nHydrogen is a cation and is attracted to the cathode (negative electrode), not the anode.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nElectrode C is the anode (positive electrode) in the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride.

This rearrangement of atoms into new molecules is an irreversible process (or not easily reversed). Therefore, it is **always** true that new substances are made during a chemical change.\n\nA change of state (e.g., solid to liquid, liquid to gas) is a physical change. While a chemical reaction can be accompanied by a change of state, it is not a requirement. For example, the reaction of two gases can produce a gaseous product, involving no change of state. Conversely, a precipitation reaction involves the formation of a solid from liquid reactants, which is a change of state. Because a change of state may or may not occur during a chemical reaction, it is only **sometimes** observed.\n\nThus, a chemical change is best described as a process where new substances are **always** made, and a change of state **sometimes** occurs.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that a change of state **always** accompanies a chemical change. A chemical change can occur without any change in the state of the reactants or products.

The formation of new substances is the fundamental definition of a chemical change. A process where no new substances are formed is a physical change, not a chemical one. Therefore, this option is fundamentally incorrect.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly states that new substances are **never** made.

According to the collision theory, increasing the temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the reactant particles (in this case, magnesium atoms and particles in the hydrochloric acid solution). This has two consequences:\n1.  The particles move faster, leading to more frequent collisions per unit of time.\n2.  A greater proportion of the colliding particles possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\nBoth of these factors increase the rate of effective (successful) collisions, thus increasing the overall rate of reaction. A faster reaction rate means the magnesium reactant is consumed more quickly, so it disappears faster.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 4 being correct:**\nThe rate of a chemical reaction can be defined as the change in the amount of a reactant or product over time. There are two main ways to measure this:\n1.  The rate at which a reactant is consumed.\n2.  The rate at which a product is formed.\nIn this reaction, magnesium powder is a reactant. Therefore, measuring how quickly the magnesium powder disappears (is consumed) is a direct way to determine the reaction rate. A faster disappearance of magnesium indicates a faster rate of reaction.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A: 1 and 2**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 1 is false. For a reaction involving a solid reactant, the surface area is a key factor affecting the rate. Smaller particles have a larger surface area to volume ratio compared to larger particles of the same mass. This larger surface area exposes more magnesium atoms to the hydrochloric acid, leading to a higher frequency of collisions and therefore a *faster* rate of reaction, meaning hydrogen is produced more quickly, not more slowly.\n\n**B: 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false. The concentration of a reactant directly affects the reaction rate. A lower concentration of hydrochloric acid means there are fewer acid particles (H\u207a ions) in a given volume of the solution. This reduces the probability of collisions between the acid particles and the magnesium atoms, decreasing the frequency of effective collisions. Consequently, a lower concentration leads to a *slower* rate of reaction, not a faster one.\n\n**D: 3 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false. As explained above, decreasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid decreases the number of reactant particles available to collide with the magnesium. This reduces the collision frequency and slows down the rate of reaction.

Adding more water will simply dissolve the pink crystals to form a pink aqueous solution containing the hydrated cobalt(II) ion, [Co(H\u2082O)\u2086]\u00b2\u207a.

A compound is formed when two or more elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed, definite ratio by mass. In brass, the copper and zinc atoms are physically intermingled but do not form new chemical bonds. The ratio of copper to zinc can be varied, which is characteristic of a mixture, not a compound.\n\n**B. a compound of copper and tin**\n\nThis description is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, brass is a mixture (an alloy), not a compound. Secondly, the constituent elements are wrong. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. An alloy of copper and tin is known as bronze.\n\n**D. a mixture of copper and tin**\n\nThis description is incorrect because it identifies the wrong constituent metals.

Aluminium is a metal renowned for its low density (approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3), which makes it very lightweight for its strength. In the aerospace industry, minimising the mass of an aircraft is critical for achieving flight, improving fuel efficiency, and increasing payload capacity. Therefore, aluminium and its alloys are extensively used to construct the main frame (fuselage) and wings of aircraft, where a high strength-to-weight ratio is essential.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThe chemical symbol **Cu** represents the element **copper**. Copper is a dense metal (approximately 8.96 g/cm\u00b3), meaning it is very heavy for its size. Using copper as a primary structural material for an aircraft would result in an impractically heavy vehicle, requiring immense power to fly and making it highly inefficient. While copper is used in aircraft, its role is functional rather than structural, primarily in electrical wiring and electronic components due to its excellent electrical conductivity.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThe chemical symbol **Fe** represents the element **iron**. Iron is the primary component of steel. Both iron and steel are strong materials, but they are also very dense (approximately 7.87 g/cm\u00b3). This high density makes them unsuitable for constructing the main body of an aircraft, as the resulting weight would be prohibitive. Although some high-strength steel alloys are used in specific, high-stress parts like landing gear, the bulk of the airframe requires a much lighter material.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThe chemical symbol **Zn** represents the element **zinc**. Zinc is a metal with a density (approximately 7.14 g/cm\u00b3) that is significantly higher than that of aluminium. This makes it too heavy to be a suitable choice for the primary structural components of an aircraft, where minimising weight is a top priority. Zinc's main applications in manufacturing are for galvanizing (coating) steel to prevent corrosion or as a component in alloys like brass."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_24.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 which property of stainless steel makes it suitable for making cutlery?\na_ it conducts electricity.\nb_ it has a high melting point.\nc_itis resistant to rusting.\nd_itis ductile.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nThe most important property of stainless steel for its use in cutlery is its resistance to rusting (corrosion). Cutlery is frequently exposed to water, air, and various substances in food, which are conditions that cause iron and regular steel to rust. Stainless steel is an alloy containing chromium, which reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, durable, and invisible layer of chromium(III) oxide on the surface. This passive layer protects the underlying iron from reacting with oxygen and water, thus preventing the formation of rust (hydrated iron(III) oxide). This ensures the cutlery remains hygienic, aesthetically pleasing, and structurally sound over a long period of use and washing.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) It conducts electricity.**\nWhile it is true that stainless steel, being a metal alloy, can conduct electricity, this property is not relevant to its function as cutlery. The purpose of forks, knives, and spoons does not involve the conduction of electric current. Therefore, this property does not contribute to its suitability for this application.\n\n**B) It has a high melting point.**\nStainless steel does have a high melting point (typically 1400-1550 \u00b0C), which means it will not melt or deform when in contact with hot food or during cleaning in a dishwasher. While this is a useful characteristic, it is not the primary reason for its selection. Other metals and alloys also have sufficiently high melting points for this purpose, but they may lack the necessary corrosion resistance that makes stainless steel ideal for cutlery.\n\n**D) It is ductile.**\nDuctility is the ability of a material to be drawn into a wire. A related property, malleability (the ability to be hammered or pressed into shape), is important for the manufacturing process of cutlery. However, these properties relate to how the cutlery is made, not to its performance during use. The key property that makes the finished product suitable for its intended purpose (eating and washing) is its ability to resist corrosion, not its ability to be shaped."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_25.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 which substances react to form hydrogen gas?\n1 calcium and water\n2 __ silver and dilute hydrochloric acid\n3 magnesium and steam\n4 zinc and dilute hydrochloric acid\na 1,3 and4 b 1tand3only c 2and4 d 4only", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe ability of a metal to react with water, steam, or a dilute acid to produce hydrogen gas is determined by its position in the reactivity series.

It is a specific type of oxidation reaction. For this chemical process to occur, two substances are essential: **water** and **oxygen**.\n\nThe process of rusting is electrochemical in nature. Small droplets of water on the surface of iron act as an electrolyte, allowing iron to be oxidised to iron(II) ions (Fe\u00b2\u207a). Simultaneously, oxygen from the air, dissolved in the water, is reduced. These iron(II) ions are then further oxidised by oxygen to form hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O), which is the reddish-brown substance we know as rust. Since both water and oxygen are directly involved as reactants in this series of reactions, both are required for iron to rust.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) oxygen and salt**\nWhile oxygen is a necessary reactant for rusting, salt is not. Salt, typically sodium chloride, acts as a catalyst that accelerates the rate of rusting. When dissolved in water, salt forms an electrolyte solution, which increases the water's conductivity. This facilitates the flow of electrons within the electrochemical cells that form on the iron's surface, speeding up the corrosion process. However, iron will still rust in the presence of just pure water and oxygen, albeit more slowly. Therefore, salt is an accelerator, not a fundamental requirement.\n\n**B) oxygen only**\nOxygen is the essential oxidising agent in the rusting process, meaning it accepts electrons from the iron. However, oxygen alone is not sufficient to cause rusting at a significant rate under normal conditions. The reaction requires an aqueous environment (the presence of water) to act as a solvent and an electrolyte, enabling the formation of the electrochemical cells necessary for the reaction to proceed. In completely dry air, rusting is practically non-existent.\n\n**D) water and salt**\nThis option correctly identifies water as a required substance and salt as an accelerator. However, it omits oxygen, which is the most critical reactant. Rusting is fundamentally the oxidation of iron. Without an oxidising agent like oxygen, the chemical conversion of iron to iron oxide cannot occur. Therefore, even in salty water, iron will not rust if oxygen is completely absent."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_28.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 coke (carbon) and limestone are two raw materials used in the extraction of iron from hematite.\nwhich type of reaction occurs when each substance is heated during the process?\n[ke insone\n\na redox redox\nb redox thermal decomposition\ncc thermal decomposition redox\nd thermal decomposition thermal decomposition", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Option\n\nThe correct option is **B**. This is because the chemical processes involving coke and limestone in the blast furnace are distinct types of reactions.\n\n1.  **Coke (Carbon):** In the blast furnace, coke is heated in a blast of hot air. It reacts with oxygen in a highly exothermic combustion reaction:\n    C(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g)\n    This is a **redox** reaction. The oxidation state of carbon increases from 0 in C to +4 in CO\u2082, meaning it is oxidized. The oxidation state of oxygen decreases from 0 in O\u2082 to -2 in CO\u2082, meaning it is reduced. Subsequently, the carbon dioxide reacts with more hot coke to form carbon monoxide (CO\u2082 + C \u2192 2CO), which is also a redox reaction. Since coke's primary role involves being oxidized, its reaction is classified as redox.\n\n2.  **Limestone (Calcium Carbonate):** Limestone (CaCO\u2083) is added to remove impurities. The high temperatures in the furnace cause it to break down into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082):\n    CaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 CaO(s) + CO\u2082(g)\n    This type of reaction, where a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances due to heat, is called **thermal decomposition**. It is not a redox reaction because the oxidation states of the elements do not change (Ca remains +2, C remains +4, and O remains -2).\n\nTherefore, coke undergoes a redox reaction, and limestone undergoes thermal decomposition.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Option A is incorrect.** While the reaction of coke is correctly identified as redox, the reaction of limestone is incorrectly identified. Limestone undergoes thermal decomposition, not a redox reaction, as there is no change in the oxidation states of its constituent elements.\n\n*   **Option C is incorrect.** The reactions for both substances are misidentified. Coke undergoes redox reactions (combustion) to produce heat and the reducing agent, not thermal decomposition. Limestone undergoes thermal decomposition, not a redox reaction.\n\n*   **Option D is incorrect.** While the reaction of limestone is correctly identified as thermal decomposition, the reaction of coke is incorrect.

Key stages include filtration to remove insoluble particles and disinfection to kill harmful microorganisms.\n    1.  **Filtration:** Water is passed through beds of sand and gravel to remove suspended solids, such as silt and grit. This effectively removes most insoluble substances.\n    2.  **Disinfection:** Chlorine or chlorine-containing compounds are added to the water in a process called chlorination. This kills harmful bacteria and other pathogens. A small, controlled amount of these chlorine compounds remains dissolved in the water as it leaves the waterworks. This residual chlorine continues to disinfect the water as it travels through the pipe system to consumers.\n    Additionally, the original source water contains naturally dissolved minerals and salts, which are not removed by these standard treatment processes. Therefore, the final water contains water, dissolved natural minerals, and the added chlorine compounds.

The fermentation of glucose produces ethanol and **carbon dioxide**, not ethanol and water.\n\n***\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nThis equation is incorrect because **ethane** is an **alkane**. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they only contain single carbon-carbon bonds. This makes them relatively unreactive, and they do not undergo an addition reaction with water (steam) to produce ethanol. The industrial process for making ethanol from a hydrocarbon uses an **alkene** (ethene), not an alkane.\n\n***\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThis option incorrectly represents the industrial preparation of ethanol via the **hydration of ethene**. While the reactants, ethene and water (as steam), are correct for this process, the products are wrong. The hydration of ethene is an **addition reaction** where a water molecule adds across the double bond of the ethene molecule. The only product formed is ethanol. The correct word equation is: **ethene + water \u2192 ethanol**.

Its properties are as follows:\n\n1.  **pH:** Being a weak acid, ethanoic acid only partially dissociates (ionises) in water to release hydrogen ions (H\u207a). This results in a solution with a pH that is acidic (less than 7) but higher than that of a strong acid of similar concentration. A pH of 4 is a reasonable value for a typical aqueous solution of ethanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Effect of adding magnesium:** Acids react with reactive metals (those above hydrogen in the reactivity series) to produce a salt and hydrogen gas. Magnesium is a reactive metal and will react with ethanoic acid according to the equation:\n    Mg(s) + 2CH\u2083COOH(aq) \u2192 Mg(CH\u2083COO)\u2082(aq) + H\u2082(g)\n    The products are magnesium ethanoate (a salt) and hydrogen gas. Therefore, the acid reacts to form hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Effect of adding sodium carbonate:** A characteristic reaction of acids is their reaction with carbonates to produce a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. Ethanoic acid reacts with sodium carbonate as follows:\n    Na\u2082CO\u2083(s) + 2CH\u2083COOH(aq) \u2192 2CH\u2083COONa(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + CO\u2082(g)\n    The products are sodium ethanoate (a salt), water, and carbon dioxide.\n\nRow B correctly identifies all three of these properties.\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, a pH of 1 is characteristic of a strong acid (like hydrochloric acid), which completely dissociates in water. Ethanoic acid is a weak acid and only partially dissociates, resulting in a higher pH (e.g., pH 3-5). Secondly, the reaction of an acid with a carbonate produces a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. This option incorrectly omits the formation of the salt (sodium ethanoate).\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that there is no reaction when magnesium is added. Magnesium is a reactive metal positioned above hydrogen in the reactivity series and will therefore react with ethanoic acid to displace hydrogen gas and form magnesium ethanoate. While the pH value and the reaction with sodium carbonate are plausible, the incorrect description of the reaction with magnesium makes this entire row incorrect.\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. Firstly, a pH of 8 is alkaline (basic), whereas ethanoic acid is an acid and must have a pH below 7. Secondly, it incorrectly states there is no reaction with magnesium.

The term \"monomer\" originates from the Greek words \"mono,\" meaning \"one,\" and \"meros,\" meaning \"part.\" During a process called polymerization, many monomer molecules chemically bond together to form a very long chain, known as a polymer. The term \"polymer\" comes from the Greek \"poly,\" meaning \"many,\" and \"meros,\" meaning \"part.\" Because a polymer is composed of numerous monomer units, it is by definition a large molecule, often referred to as a macromolecule. Therefore, monomers are small molecules, and polymers are large molecules.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that monomers are large molecules. Monomers are the fundamental, small building blocks. A large molecule consisting of many repeating units is the definition of a polymer, not a monomer.\n\n**B:** This option incorrectly describes monomers as large and polymers as small. This reverses the actual relationship. A polymer is formed from the combination of many monomers, so it is inherently larger than a single monomer unit. It is chemically and logically impossible for many small units to combine to form a single, smaller entity.\n\n**D:** This option correctly identifies monomers as small but incorrectly describes polymers as small.

This is the characteristic positive result for the presence of potassium ions (K\u207a).\n2.  **Test for the Anion:** The second test involves adding dilute hydrochloric acid. This causes effervescence, producing a gas. This gas is then tested with limewater (an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)\u2082), which it turns cloudy. The gas that turns limewater cloudy is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The cloudiness is due to the formation of a white precipitate of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083). The production of carbon dioxide gas upon the addition of an acid is the standard test for a carbonate ion (CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b).

Sodium ions produce a yellow-orange flame, not the lilac flame observed in the test.\n\n*   **C. potassium sulfate:** The potassium ion (K\u207a) in this compound would correctly produce a lilac flame. However, the anion is a sulfate ion (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b), which is the salt of a strong acid (sulfuric acid) and does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce a gas.

Because the number of protons (the atomic number) determines the element's identity, isotopes have the same chemical properties.

For example, carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (6 protons, 8 neutrons) are isotopes of carbon.\n\n---\n### **Analysis of Incorrect Options**\n\n**A. Atoms with different numbers of electrons are isotopes of each other.**\nThis statement is incorrect. When a neutral atom gains or loses electrons, it forms an ion. An ion is a charged particle of the same element. For instance, a sodium atom (Na) can lose an electron to become a sodium ion (Na\u207a).

Isotopes of the same element, by definition, have different numbers of neutrons and therefore must have different mass numbers. Atoms of *different* elements that happen to have the same mass number are called isobars.

Since an electron carries a negative charge, gaining one electron results in the formation of a negative ion (anion) with a charge of 1\u2212. This is a common chemical property for all elements within this group. For example, fluorine forms F\u207b, chlorine forms Cl\u207b, and bromine forms Br\u207b.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. All the ions have the same number of electron shells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The number of electron shells corresponds to the period number of an element in the Periodic Table.

Group VII elements are non-metals with seven valence electrons. Losing an electron is energetically unfavourable as it would result in an unstable ion with six valence electrons. Instead, they achieve stability by gaining one electron to complete their outer shell. Losing electrons is characteristic of metals and results in the formation of positive ions (cations), whereas Group VII elements gain electrons to form negative ions (anions).\n\n**D. Each ion has seven electrons in its outer electron shell.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes the neutral atom of a Group VII element, not the ion.

While it correctly identifies that potassium bromide has a high melting point, it incorrectly states that it is insoluble in water and a good electrical conductor when solid. Ionic compounds like potassium bromide are typically soluble in polar solvents like water and are poor conductors in the solid state because their ions are not mobile.\n\n#### B\nThis option is incorrect. It correctly states that potassium bromide is soluble in water, but it incorrectly describes it as having a low melting point and being a good electrical conductor when solid. The strong electrostatic forces in the giant ionic lattice give potassium bromide a high melting point, and the fixed position of its ions in the solid state prevents electrical conductivity.\n\n#### C\nThis option is incorrect. While it correctly identifies that potassium bromide is a poor electrical conductor when solid, it incorrectly states that it is insoluble in water and has a low melting point. Ionic compounds like potassium bromide are generally soluble in water and have high melting points due to the strong forces within their crystal lattice."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_47.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "7 which statement explains why graphite is used as a lubricant?\na_ each carbon atom in graphite forms three bonds.\nb_ the bonding in graphite is covalent.\nc_ the carbon atoms are arranged in hexagons.\nd_ there are weak forces of attraction between the layers of carbon atoms.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "***\n\n### **Correct Answer: D**\nGraphite has a giant covalent structure composed of layers of carbon atoms. Within each layer, every carbon atom is strongly covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms, forming hexagonal rings. However, between these layers, there are only weak intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces). These weak forces require very little energy to overcome, allowing the layers to easily slide over one another. This ability of the layers to slip and slide is what gives graphite its characteristic slippery feel and makes it an effective solid lubricant.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Each carbon atom in graphite forms three bonds.**\n    This statement is factually correct but does not explain why graphite is a lubricant. The formation of three covalent bonds by each carbon atom (instead of the maximum four) results in one delocalised electron per atom. These delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the structure, which is the reason graphite can conduct electricity. This property is unrelated to its use as a lubricant.\n\n*   **B. The bonding in graphite is covalent.**\n    This statement is only partially descriptive. While graphite does contain strong covalent bonds *within* its layers, this feature alone does not explain its lubricating properties. In fact, strong covalent bonding throughout a substance, as seen in the allotrope diamond, leads to extreme hardness and rigidity, making it an abrasive, not a lubricant. The key to graphite's lubricating ability lies in the *weakness* of the forces *between* the layers, not the strength of the bonds *within* them.\n\n*   **C. The carbon atoms are arranged in hexagons.**\n    This statement describes the arrangement of atoms within a single layer of graphite. While this hexagonal arrangement is a fundamental part of graphite's structure, it does not, by itself, explain why the material is slippery. This arrangement leads to the formation of strong, flat sheets. The lubricating property is a result of how these individual sheets interact with each other, which is determined by the weak forces between them, not the arrangement of atoms within them."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_48.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 what is the balanced equation for the reaction between magnesium and dilute sulfuric acid?\na mg + h,so, > mgso, + h,\nb mg + 2h,so, \u2014 mg(so,), + 2h,\nc 2mg + h,so, > mg,so, + h,\nd 2mg + 3h,so, \u2014> mg,(so,), + 3h,", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe reaction between a metal and a dilute acid is a single displacement reaction.

Mg + 2H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 Mg(SO\u2084)\u2082 + 2H\u2082**\nThis equation is incorrect because the chemical formula for the product, magnesium sulfate, is wrong. The formula Mg(SO\u2084)\u2082 implies that the magnesium ion has a charge of +4 or that the sulfate ion has a charge of -1, neither of which is correct. The magnesium ion is Mg\u00b2\u207a and the sulfate ion is SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, so they combine in a 1:1 ratio to form MgSO\u2084.\n\n**C. 2Mg + H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 Mg\u2082SO\u2084 + H\u2082**\nThis equation is incorrect due to the wrong chemical formula for magnesium sulfate. The formula Mg\u2082SO\u2084 would require each magnesium ion to have a charge of +1 to balance the -2 charge of the single sulfate ion. However, magnesium consistently forms a +2 ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a).\n\n**D. 2Mg + 3H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 Mg\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083 + 3H\u2082**\nThis equation is incorrect because the chemical formula for magnesium sulfate is wrong. The formula Mg\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083 implies that the magnesium ion has a charge of +3. This is incorrect; as a Group 2 metal, magnesium forms ions with a +2 charge.

The relative atomic mass of an element is the weighted average mass of its isotopes on a scale where one atom of carbon-12 has a mass of 12.

The standard is a complete atom. Furthermore, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons due to the nuclear binding energy (mass-energy equivalence).

A chemical change is a process that results in the formation of new chemical substances with different properties and compositions.\n\n*   **Neutralisation** is a chemical reaction between an acid and a base, which produces a salt and water. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H\u2082O).

For instance, ethene monomers polymerise to form poly(ethene).\n*   **Combustion** (burning) is a rapid chemical reaction between a substance and an oxidant, usually oxygen, to produce heat and light. New chemical substances, typically oxides, are formed. For example, the combustion of methane (CH\u2084) produces carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O).\n\nSince all three processes involve the formation of new substances through the breaking and making of chemical bonds, this list contains only chemical changes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. melting, evaporating, dissolving**\n\nThis list contains only physical changes.

Experiment 1 uses a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid (0.20 mol/dm\u00b3) compared to Experiment 2 (0.10 mol/dm\u00b3).

Graph B correctly shows that curve 1 (representing Experiment 1) has a steeper initial gradient than curve 2 (representing Experiment 2), indicating a faster initial rate.\n*   **Final Volume of Gas:** In this reaction, calcium carbonate is in excess, so hydrochloric acid is the limiting reactant. The total volume of gas produced is determined by the initial amount (moles) of hydrochloric acid.

This is because a higher temperature provides the reactant particles (hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate) with more kinetic energy. As a result, the particles move faster, leading to more frequent collisions. More importantly, a greater proportion of these collisions will have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur. This significantly increases the frequency of effective collisions, thereby increasing the rate of reaction.\n\n*   **Explanation for incorrect option A:**\n    Adding water to the hydrochloric acid dilutes it, which decreases the concentration of the acid. A lower concentration means there are fewer acid particles per unit volume. This reduces the frequency of collisions between the acid particles and the calcium carbonate particles, leading to a lower frequency of effective collisions and thus a *slower* rate of reaction.\n\n*   **Explanation for incorrect option B:**\n    Increasing the size of the pieces of calcium carbonate *decreases* the total surface area exposed to the acid. For a given mass, larger pieces have a smaller surface area to volume ratio compared to smaller pieces (like a powder). A smaller surface area means fewer calcium carbonate particles are available for reaction at any one time. This reduces the frequency of effective collisions with the acid particles, causing the reaction rate to *decrease*. To increase the rate, one would use smaller pieces to increase the surface area.\n\n*   **Explanation for incorrect option D:**\n    The reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid produces carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), which is a gas. The experiment is performed in an open conical flask, allowing this gas to escape into the surroundings.

Rubidium is in Period 5, directly below potassium (Period 4).\n\n1.  **Melting Point Trend:** As you descend Group I, the melting point decreases. This is because the atoms become larger, leading to a greater distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised sea of electrons. This weakens the metallic bonding, meaning less energy is required to overcome these forces and melt the element. The trend observed is: Lithium (181 \u00b0C) > Sodium (98 \u00b0C) > Potassium (64 \u00b0C). Therefore, the melting point of rubidium must be lower than 64 \u00b0C. A value of 39 \u00b0C is consistent with this trend.\n\n2.  **Reactivity Trend:** As you descend Group I, reactivity increases. This is because the single valence electron is further from the nucleus and experiences more shielding from the inner electron shells. This makes the electron easier to lose in a chemical reaction. The observed reactivity with water increases down the group: Lithium (fizzes steadily) < Sodium (fizzes vigorously) < Potassium (fizzes very vigorously). Rubidium, being below potassium, will react even more violently. The description \"fizzes explosively\" accurately reflects this increased reactivity.\n\nOption B provides a melting point (39 \u00b0C) and a reactivity description (\"fizzes explosively\") that are both consistent with the established trends for Group I elements.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A is incorrect.** While the melting point of 39 \u00b0C is consistent with the trend of decreasing melting points down Group I, the description of the reaction with water, \"fizzes slowly,\" is not. Reactivity increases down Group I, so rubidium must react more vigorously than potassium (\"fizzes very vigorously\"), not less vigorously than lithium (\"fizzes steadily\").\n\n**C is incorrect.** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the melting point of 81 \u00b0C contradicts the trend of decreasing melting points down Group I (potassium's melting point is 64 \u00b0C). Secondly, the reactivity \"fizzes very vigorously\" is the same as potassium's. As reactivity increases down the group, rubidium should be more reactive than potassium.\n\n**D is incorrect.** Although the description of the reaction, \"fizzes explosively,\" is consistent with the trend of increasing reactivity down Group I, the melting point of 81 \u00b0C is not.

Soluble impurities, by definition, are dissolved in the solvent. Therefore, they would pass through the filter paper along with the copper(II) sulfate solution and would not be removed by this process.\n\n**B. to remove sulfuric acid**\n\nThe procedure deliberately uses an excess of copper(II) oxide. The purpose of this is to ensure that all of the sulfuric acid is consumed in the reaction. As the sulfuric acid is the limiting reactant, it will be completely neutralized, and none should remain in the final mixture. Therefore, there is no unreacted sulfuric acid to be removed by filtration.\n\n**C. to remove the blue crystals**\n\nAt the stage where filtration is carried out, the desired product, copper(II) sulfate, is dissolved in water, forming a blue aqueous solution. The blue crystals have not yet been formed. Crystallization occurs in the subsequent step when the filtrate is cooled or the solvent is evaporated.

The elements in Group VII are known as the halogens. The reactivity of the halogens decreases as you go down the group. This means that a more reactive halogen (higher up the group) can displace a less reactive halogen (lower down the group) from an aqueous solution of its halide salt. Bromine is in Period 4, while iodine is in Period 5. Since bromine is higher up in Group VII than iodine, it is more reactive. Therefore, when bromine is added to an aqueous solution of potassium iodide, it will displace the iodide ions, forming potassium bromide and elemental iodine.

While all halogens exist as diatomic molecules (Cl\u2082, Br\u2082, I\u2082), their states change down the group due to increasing strength of intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces).

Lithium, sodium, and potassium are elements in Group I of the periodic table, known as the alkali metals. While it is true that they are soft metals (soft enough to be cut with a knife), they are distinctly classified as metals, not non-metals. Metals are typically good conductors of heat and electricity, are lustrous, and form positive ions, all of which are characteristic properties of these elements.\n\n**D: Lithium, sodium and potassium have an increasing number of electrons in their outer shells.**\nThis statement is incorrect.

Elements in Group I have one electron in their outermost shell. To achieve the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, they lose this single valence electron, forming a positive ion (cation) with a charge of 1+. Therefore, rubidium forms the Rb\u207a ion.\n\nStrontium (Sr) is an alkaline earth metal in Group II. Elements in Group II have two electrons in their outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, they lose both of these valence electrons, forming a cation with a charge of 2+. Consequently, strontium forms the Sr\u00b2\u207a ion.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Each element has five electrons in its outer electron shell.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The period number indicates the number of electron shells in an atom, not the number of outer electrons. Since both elements are in Period 5, their atoms each have five electron shells. The number of outer electrons (valence electrons) is determined by the group number for main group elements. Rubidium is in Group I and has one outer electron. Strontium is in Group II and has two outer electrons.\n\n**B. The atomic number of rubidium is greater than the atomic number of strontium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The atomic number increases sequentially from left to right across a period in the Periodic Table. Rubidium is in Group I and Strontium is in Group II. As they are in the same period, Strontium is to the right of Rubidium. Therefore, Rubidium has a lower atomic number (37) than Strontium (38).\n\n**D. Electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride and of molten strontium chloride produces hydrogen.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The electrolysis of a **molten** ionic compound breaks it down into its constituent elements. Molten rubidium chloride (RbCl) contains only rubidium ions (Rb\u207a) and chloride ions (Cl\u207b). Electrolysis will produce rubidium metal at the cathode and chlorine gas at the anode. Similarly, molten strontium chloride (SrCl\u2082) contains only strontium ions (Sr\u00b2\u207a) and chloride ions (Cl\u207b), and its electrolysis will produce strontium metal and chlorine gas. Hydrogen is not present in these molten compounds and therefore cannot be produced. Hydrogen gas would only be produced at the cathode if an **aqueous** solution of these salts were electrolysed, as water would be reduced in preference to the highly reactive metal ions."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_67.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 acompany needs a metal with a low density which resists corrosion and is a good electrical\nconductor.\nwhich metal should it use?\na aluminium\nbiron\nc magnesium\nd sodium", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nAluminium is the most suitable metal because it meets all the specified criteria.\n1.  **Low density:** Aluminium has a density of approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is significantly lower than many common metals like iron or copper. This makes it lightweight.\n2.  **Resists corrosion:** Although aluminium is a reactive metal, it readily forms a very thin, tough, and unreactive layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface upon exposure to air. This process, known as passivation, protects the metal underneath from further corrosion.\n3.  **Good electrical conductor:** Aluminium is an excellent conductor of electricity. Due to its combination of low density and high conductivity, it is widely used for overhead power cables.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. iron**\nIron does not meet two of the key requirements. It has a high density (approximately 7.87 g/cm\u00b3), making it heavy. More importantly, iron is highly susceptible to corrosion (rusting) in the presence of oxygen and water, forming hydrated iron(III) oxide. It does not naturally form a protective layer like aluminium does.\n\n**C. magnesium**\nWhile magnesium has a very low density (even lower than aluminium) and is a good electrical conductor, it is a highly reactive metal. It corrodes easily when exposed to air and moisture and does not form the same durable, protective oxide layer that makes aluminium corrosion-resistant. Its high reactivity makes it unsuitable for applications where corrosion resistance is essential.\n\n**D. sodium**\nSodium is an alkali metal and is extremely reactive. Although it has a very low density and is a good electrical conductor, it reacts vigorously with air and water. It must be stored under oil to prevent it from corroding almost instantly.

The primary component of stainless steel is iron. In pure iron, the atoms are all the same size and are arranged in a regular, repeating lattice structure. This regularity allows the layers of atoms to slide over one another relatively easily when a force is applied, making pure iron comparatively soft and malleable.\n\nTo make stainless steel, other elements, such as chromium and carbon, are mixed with the iron. These atoms are of a different size to the iron atoms. Their presence disrupts the regular arrangement of the iron lattice. This disruption makes it much more difficult for the layers of atoms to slide past each other. Consequently, a greater force is needed to deform the material, making the alloy significantly harder and stronger than pure iron.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: All atoms in stainless steel are the same size.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Stainless steel is an alloy, meaning it is a mixture of different elements. It consists mainly of iron atoms but also contains atoms of other elements like chromium, and often nickel and carbon. Atoms of different elements have different atomic radii (sizes). Therefore, stainless steel is composed of atoms of various sizes.\n\n*   **B: Stainless steel is a mixture of copper and zinc.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The alloy that is a mixture of copper and zinc is called brass. Stainless steel is an alloy based on iron, with its primary alloying element being chromium, which gives it its corrosion resistance.\n\n*   **C: Stainless steel is an iron compound.**\n    This statement is incorrect. There is a fundamental difference between a mixture and a compound. In a compound, elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. In an alloy like stainless steel, the elements are physically mixed, not chemically bonded in a fixed stoichiometry.

This is primarily done for two reasons: to improve the appearance of the object or to provide a protective layer against corrosion.\n\n1.  **Statement 2: It improves the tap's resistance to corrosion.** This statement is correct. Steel is an alloy composed mainly of iron, which is prone to rusting (a form of corrosion) when it comes into contact with water and oxygen. A water tap is constantly exposed to these conditions. Copper is less reactive than iron and is significantly more resistant to corrosion from water. By electroplating the steel tap with a layer of copper, a protective barrier is created. This barrier prevents the underlying steel from being exposed to the elements, thereby preventing rust and extending the functional life of the tap. This is a primary and crucial reason for electroplating in this application.\n\n### Explanation of Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Statement 1: It improves the conductivity of the tap.** This statement is not a valid reason. The primary function of a water tap is to control the flow of water, not to conduct electricity. While it is true that copper is a better electrical conductor than steel, this property is entirely irrelevant to the tap's function. Therefore, improving conductivity is not the purpose of electroplating a water tap.\n\n*   **Statement 3: It increases the density of the tap.** This statement is not a valid reason. Electroplating involves adding a very thin layer of metal. Although copper has a slightly higher density than steel, the amount of copper added is minuscule compared to the total mass and volume of the steel tap. Any resulting change in the overall density of the tap would be negligible and is not the intended purpose of the process. The goal of electroplating is to modify the surface properties (like corrosion resistance or appearance), not the bulk properties (like density).\n\nSince only statement 2 provides a correct and relevant explanation for electroplating a steel water tap, options A, B, and D, which include incorrect or irrelevant statements, are incorrect."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_70.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 the table shows the results of separately heating four metals with oxides of different metals.\nthe four metals are iron, copper, magnesium and y.\nthe results are shown.\nmetal | magnesium y copper iron\noxide oxide oxide oxide\niron x x a x key\ncopper x x x x v = reaction\nmagnesium x v v v x = no reaction\ny x x v v\nwhat is the order of reactivity of the metals, least reactive first?\n| | least reactive es most reactive\na copper iron y magnesium\nb copper y iron magnesium\ncc magnesium iron y copper\nd magnesium \u00a5 iron copper", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from its oxide in a chemical reaction. The reactivity series of metals can be determined by observing which displacement reactions occur.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Most Reactive Metal:**\n    The results show that magnesium metal reacts with the oxides of Y, copper, and iron, displacing all of them. This means magnesium is more reactive than Y, copper, and iron. Therefore, magnesium is the most reactive metal.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Least Reactive Metal:**\n    The results show that copper metal does not react with the oxides of magnesium, Y, or iron. Conversely, the oxides of copper are displaced by magnesium, iron, and Y. This means copper is less reactive than all the other metals. Therefore, copper is the least reactive metal.\n\n3.  **Comparing Iron and Y:**\n    To determine the relative reactivity of iron and Y, we look at their reactions with each other's oxides.\n    *   The table shows that metal Y reacts with iron oxide (`\u2713`).

Metals that are lower in the reactivity series are less reactive and are therefore found as less stable compounds in their ores. This makes them easier to extract. Copper is a relatively unreactive metal, located below carbon in the reactivity series. Consequently, it can be extracted from its ore by relatively simple processes, such as heating the ore with carbon (a reduction reaction) or even just heating some ores (like copper sulfide) in the air. This process is less energy-intensive compared to the extraction of more reactive metals.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. aluminium**\nAluminium is a highly reactive metal, positioned high in the reactivity series. It forms a very stable oxide (alumina, Al\u2082O\u2083) which is the primary component of its ore, bauxite. Because aluminium is more reactive than carbon, it cannot be reduced from its oxide by heating with carbon. Instead, it must be extracted using electrolysis of the molten oxide, a process that requires a vast amount of electrical energy and is therefore considered difficult and expensive.\n\n**C. calcium**\nCalcium is a very reactive metal, located near the top of the reactivity series, above aluminium. It forms extremely stable compounds in its ores. Like aluminium, it is far more reactive than carbon, making reduction with carbon impossible. The extraction of calcium requires electrolysis of its molten salts (like calcium chloride), a process that is highly energy-intensive and difficult to carry out, making it one of the more challenging metals to obtain.\n\n**D. iron**\nIron is in the middle of the reactivity series, being more reactive than copper but less reactive than aluminium and calcium. It is extracted from its ore (typically haematite, Fe\u2082O\u2083) by reduction with carbon (coke) in a blast furnace. While this method also uses carbon, it requires significantly higher temperatures (around 1500\u00b0C) and a much more complex industrial setup than the extraction of copper. Because iron is more reactive than copper, more energy is needed to separate it from its ore, making the process more difficult."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_72.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "32 why is distilled water used in chemical experiments rather than tap water?\na distilled water contains fewer chemical impurities.\nb __ distilled water has a better colour.\nc distilled water has a higher boiling point.\nd distilled water is a better solvent.", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nDistilled water is water that has been purified by distillation, a process that involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam. This process effectively removes dissolved salts, minerals, and other non-volatile chemical impurities that are commonly found in tap water. In chemical experiments, these impurities can act as unintended reactants, catalysts, or inhibitors, interfering with the desired chemical reaction. This could lead to the formation of unexpected precipitates, inaccurate measurements (e.g., in titrations), or incorrect observations. Using distilled water ensures that the water used as a solvent or reagent is essentially pure H\u2082O, making the experimental results valid, reliable, and reproducible.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Distilled water has a better colour.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Both tap water and distilled water are colourless. While tap water may sometimes appear cloudy or have a slight tint due to high concentrations of minerals or particles from pipes, this is not a universal characteristic. The primary reason for using distilled water in experiments is based on its chemical purity, not its aesthetic properties like colour.\n\n**C. Distilled water has a higher boiling point.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The presence of dissolved impurities (solutes) in a liquid elevates its boiling point, a colligative property known as boiling point elevation. Since tap water contains dissolved minerals and salts, its boiling point is actually slightly higher than 100\u00b0C (at standard pressure). Distilled water, being pure, has a boiling point of exactly 100\u00b0C. Therefore, distilled water has a *lower*, not higher, boiling point than tap water.\n\n**D. Distilled water is a better solvent.**\nThe inherent ability of water to act as a solvent is due to the polarity of the H\u2082O molecule. This property is the same for both tap water and distilled water. While it is true that the impurities in tap water are already dissolved, potentially reducing its capacity to dissolve additional substances, the fundamental reason for choosing distilled water is not that it possesses superior solvent power.

They share the same functional group (-COOH), have similar acidic properties, and each successive compound has an additional CH\u2082 unit. Their general formula is C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2081COOH. Therefore, the term \"carboxylic acid\" refers to both a type of compound and the name of a homologous series.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Carbonate:** A carbonate is an inorganic compound containing the carbonate ion (CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b), such as sodium carbonate (Na\u2082CO\u2083) or calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083). These are typically ionic salts. Inorganic compounds like these do not form a homologous series because they do not consist of a series of molecules differing by a repeating CH\u2082 unit, nor do they share the structural characteristics of a homologous series.\n\n**C. Halide:** The term \"halide\" generally refers to a compound containing a halogen atom or a halide ion (e.g., F\u207b, Cl\u207b, Br\u207b, I\u207b). This can include inorganic salts like sodium chloride (NaCl) or organic compounds like chloromethane (CH\u2083Cl). While organic halides, specifically **haloalkanes**, do form a homologous series, the term \"halide\" itself is a broad classification, not the name of a specific homologous series. The series is correctly named haloalkanes, not halides.\n\n**D. Hydroxide:** The term \"hydroxide\" typically refers to an inorganic compound containing the hydroxide ion (OH\u207b), such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These are inorganic bases and do not form a homologous series.

Substances with low volatility have high boiling points, strong intermolecular forces, and are typically composed of large molecules. In the fractional distillation of petroleum, a temperature gradient exists in the fractionating column, with the highest temperatures at the bottom and the lowest at the top. Crude oil is heated and vaporized before entering the column. As the hot vapor mixture rises, it cools. Fractions with very high boiling points condense at the lower, hotter levels of the column. Bitumen consists of very large hydrocarbon molecules (over 70 carbon atoms) with strong intermolecular forces, giving it the highest boiling point of all the fractions. Consequently, it does not rise very far up the column and is collected as a liquid residue at the bottom. This makes it the least volatile fraction.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. diesel oil**\n\nDiesel oil is collected from the middle section of the fractionating column. This indicates that it has a boiling point and volatility that are intermediate compared to the other fractions. The hydrocarbon molecules in diesel oil are smaller than those in lubricating oil and bitumen but larger than those in gasoline. Therefore, diesel oil is more volatile than bitumen, as it vaporizes at a lower temperature and condenses at a higher, cooler level in the column. Since the question asks for the least volatile fraction, diesel oil is not the correct answer.\n\n**C. gasoline**\n\nGasoline is a highly volatile fraction, meaning it vaporizes easily at relatively low temperatures. It is composed of relatively small hydrocarbon molecules (typically 5-12 carbon atoms) which have weaker intermolecular forces compared to larger fractions like diesel oil or bitumen. Due to its low boiling point, gasoline vapor rises to the upper, cooler parts of the fractionating column before it condenses and is collected. As it is one of the most volatile fractions, it is not the correct answer.\n\n**D. refinery gas**\n\nRefinery gas is the most volatile fraction obtained from petroleum. It consists of the smallest hydrocarbon molecules (1-4 carbon atoms) which have very weak intermolecular forces and extremely low boiling points.

A molecule of methane consists of one central carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Carbon, being in Group 14 of the Periodic Table, has four valence electrons. To achieve a stable, full outer shell of eight electrons (octet rule), it forms four covalent bonds. Each hydrogen atom has one valence electron and needs one more electron to achieve a stable configuration (duplet rule). Consequently, the carbon atom shares one pair of electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms, forming four separate, single covalent C-H bonds.\n\n### Why Other Options are Incorrect:\n\n**A. It is an alcohol.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Alcohols are a homologous series of organic compounds defined by the presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) functional group. Methane (CH\u2084) is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, and lacks the -OH group. The simplest alcohol is methanol (CH\u2083OH).\n\n**B. It is an unsaturated molecule.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Methane is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated compound contains only single covalent bonds between its atoms. An unsaturated compound must contain at least one carbon-carbon double (C=C) or triple (C\u2261C) bond. Since methane (CH\u2084) only contains single C-H bonds, it is classified as saturated.\n\n**C.

Firstly, when combusted, especially under conditions of incomplete combustion (insufficient oxygen), they release toxic gases. For poly(ethene), this includes carbon monoxide (CO), a poisonous gas. Other plastics, such as PVC, can release acidic gases like hydrogen chloride (HCl). Complete combustion produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Secondly, plastics are non-biodegradable, meaning they are not broken down by natural processes. Consequently, discarded plastic waste persists in the environment for centuries, accumulating in landfills, on land, and particularly in oceans, where it harms marine life through entanglement and ingestion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly states that plastics neither produce toxic gases when burned nor accumulate in the oceans. Both of these statements are scientifically inaccurate. The combustion of plastics is a known source of air pollution, releasing toxic gases like carbon monoxide and other pollutants. Furthermore, the persistence of non-biodegradable plastic in the environment is a well-documented problem, leading to vast accumulation in marine ecosystems worldwide.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly identifies that plastics accumulate in the oceans but incorrectly states that they do not produce toxic gases when burned. While the accumulation of non-biodegradable plastics in marine environments is a major pollution issue, the air pollution caused by burning them is also a significant environmental problem. The combustion of plastics releases harmful substances, including toxic carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from complete combustion. Therefore, this option only provides a partial explanation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option correctly identifies that plastics produce toxic gases when burned but incorrectly states that they do not accumulate in the oceans. The release of toxic gases like carbon monoxide during the combustion of plastics is a valid cause of pollution. However, a defining environmental problem of plastics is their non-biodegradable nature, which leads to their long-term persistence and accumulation in the environment, most notably in the world's oceans.

The gas is then cooled in a condenser, where it turns back into a pure liquid, which is collected as the distillate. The solid or non-volatile substance that remains in the original container is known as the residue. In experiment 2, sea water (a solution of salts in water) is distilled.

In experiment 1, the undissolved crystals are the filtrate.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misuses the term 'filtrate'. Filtration is a method used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. The liquid that passes through the filter paper is called the filtrate, while the solid that is trapped on the filter paper is called the residue.

For a substance to conduct electricity, it must have mobile charged particles. In the solid state, the ions in an ionic compound are not free to move. Therefore, solid ionic compounds are poor electrical conductors.\n*   **Melting Point:** The electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions in the lattice are very strong. A large amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these forces and break down the lattice structure, allowing the ions to become mobile in the liquid state.

The general equation is: Acid + Alkali \u2192 Salt + Water.\n\nIn this specific reaction, the acid is nitric acid (HNO\u2083) and the alkali is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These reactions are typically carried out in aqueous solutions, meaning both the acid and the alkali are dissolved in water. The state symbol for a substance dissolved in water is (aq).\n\nThe products are sodium nitrate (NaNO\u2083) and water (H\u2082O). Sodium nitrate is a salt that is soluble in water, so it will remain dissolved in the solution, hence its state symbol is (aq). Water is formed as a pure liquid, so its state symbol is (l).\n\nTherefore, the correctly balanced chemical equation, including the correct state symbols, is:\n**NaOH(aq) + HNO\u2083(aq) \u2192 NaNO\u2083(aq) + H\u2082O(l)**\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. NaOH(aq) + HNO\u2083(aq) \u2192 NaNO\u2083(l) + H\u2082O(l)**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because of the state symbol for the product, sodium nitrate (NaNO\u2083). The symbol (l) indicates a pure liquid, which means the sodium nitrate would have to be molten. The melting point of sodium nitrate is 308 \u00b0C. A standard neutralisation reaction in an aqueous solution does not generate enough heat to melt the salt. Since sodium nitrate is soluble in water, it would exist as an aqueous solution, correctly represented by the state symbol (aq), not (l).\n\n**C.

Firstly, the state symbols for the reactants, NaOH(l) and HNO\u2083(l), imply that the reaction is between molten sodium hydroxide and pure liquid nitric acid. While theoretically possible at very high temperatures, standard neutralisation reactions occur in aqueous solutions. Secondly, the state symbol for water, H\u2082O(aq), is incorrect. The symbol (aq) means 'dissolved in water'. Water is the solvent itself and a product in its pure liquid form, so its correct state symbol should be (l).\n\n**D. NaOH(l) + HNO\u2083(l) \u2192 NaNO\u2083(l) + H\u2082O(l)**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because it misrepresents the typical conditions for a neutralisation reaction.

The electrolyte contains four types of ions: sodium ions (Na\u207a) and chloride ions (Cl\u207b) from the salt, and hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) from the partial dissociation of water.\n\nThe electrode labelled X is connected to the negative terminal of the power supply, making it the **cathode**. Positive ions (cations), Na\u207a and H\u207a, are attracted to the cathode. According to the electrochemical series, the ion of the less reactive element is preferentially discharged. Since hydrogen is less reactive than sodium, hydrogen ions are reduced to form hydrogen gas.\n*   **Cathode (X) reaction:** 2H\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 H\u2082(g)\nTherefore, gas X is **hydrogen**.\n\nThe electrode labelled Y is connected to the positive terminal, making it the **anode**. Negative ions (anions), Cl\u207b and OH\u207b, are attracted to the anode. In a **concentrated** solution of a halide, the halide ion is preferentially discharged over the hydroxide ion, even though hydroxide is typically easier to discharge. Thus, chloride ions are oxidised to form chlorine gas.\n*   **Anode (Y) reaction:** 2Cl\u207b(aq) \u2192 Cl\u2082(g) + 2e\u207b\nTherefore, gas Y is **chlorine**.\n\nBased on this analysis, X is hydrogen and Y is chlorine, which corresponds to option B.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: chlorine, hydrogen**\nThis is incorrect. Chlorine gas is formed from chloride ions (Cl\u207b), which are negative and are attracted to the positive electrode (anode, Y). Hydrogen gas is formed from hydrogen ions (H\u207a), which are positive and are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode, X). This option incorrectly reverses the products at the electrodes.\n\n**C: hydrogen, oxygen**\nThis is incorrect. While hydrogen is correctly identified as the product at the cathode (X), oxygen is not the product at the anode (Y). Oxygen gas is produced when hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) are discharged (4OH\u207b \u2192 O\u2082 + 2H\u2082O + 4e\u207b). This occurs during the electrolysis of *dilute* sodium chloride. However, the question specifies a *concentrated* solution, where the high concentration of chloride ions (Cl\u207b) leads to their preferential discharge, producing chlorine gas instead of oxygen.\n\n**D: oxygen, hydrogen**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the products are assigned to the wrong electrodes; hydrogen is produced at the cathode (X) and a non-metal gas at the anode (Y).

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n2H\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 2H\u2082O(l)\n\nAs shown in the equation, the reactants are hydrogen (H\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082). The only product is water (H\u2082O). Since there are no carbon atoms present in the reactants, it is impossible for carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), a compound containing carbon, to be produced. This is a primary environmental advantage of hydrogen fuel cells over the combustion of fossil fuels, which do produce carbon dioxide.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Hydrogen fuel cells do not need oxygen.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Oxygen is an essential reactant in a hydrogen fuel cell. It acts as the oxidising agent. At the cathode (the positive electrode), oxygen molecules are reduced, meaning they gain electrons. They then combine with hydrogen ions to form water. Without a continuous supply of oxygen, the electrochemical reaction would cease, and the fuel cell would stop generating electricity.\n\n**C: The waste from a hydrogen fuel cell is an acidic gas.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The sole waste product from the reaction in a hydrogen fuel cell is water (H\u2082O). Water is a neutral substance with a pH of approximately 7. It is not acidic. Acidic gases are substances like sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) or nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), which are not produced by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n**D: The reaction in a fuel cell is endothermic.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The purpose of a fuel cell is to release chemical energy from a fuel (in this case, hydrogen) and convert it into electrical energy.

The reaction is endothermic.**\n\nIn a reaction pathway diagram, the y-axis represents the potential energy of the chemical system. The diagram shows that the energy level of the products is higher than the energy level of the reactants. This means that for the reaction to occur, there must be a net absorption of energy from the surroundings. A reaction that absorbs energy from the surroundings is defined as an endothermic reaction. The overall enthalpy change (\u0394H) for this reaction is positive.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The reaction rate increases during the reaction.**\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is generally highest at the beginning and decreases as the reaction proceeds. This is because the concentration of reactants is at its maximum at the start. As reactants are converted into products, their concentration decreases, leading to fewer successful collisions between reactant particles per unit of time, thus slowing the reaction rate.\n\n**C. The reaction transfers thermal energy to the surroundings.**\n\nThis statement describes an exothermic reaction. In an exothermic reaction, the products have lower energy than the reactants, and the excess energy is released into the surroundings, usually as heat. The provided diagram shows the opposite: the products have higher energy than the reactants, indicating energy is absorbed from the surroundings, not transferred to them.\n\n**D. The temperature of the surroundings increases.**\n\nAn increase in the temperature of the surroundings occurs when a reaction releases thermal energy (an exothermic reaction). Since the reaction shown is endothermic, it absorbs thermal energy from its surroundings. This absorption of energy causes the temperature of the surroundings to decrease."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_92.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "12 lumps of calcium carbonate react with dilute hydrochloric acid as shown.\ncaco; + 2hcl > cacl, + h,0 + coz\nwhich change in conditions decreases the rate of the reaction?\na __ increasing the concentration of the acid\nb_ increasing the volume of the acid\nc increasing the size of the lumps of calcium carbonate\nd_ increasing the temperature", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "*   **Correct Answer (C): increasing the size of the lumps of calcium carbonate**\n\n    The rate of a chemical reaction depends on the frequency of effective collisions between reactant particles. This reaction occurs between a solid (calcium carbonate) and an aqueous solution (hydrochloric acid), so the reaction can only happen on the surface of the solid. For a given mass of a solid, larger lumps have a smaller total surface area compared to smaller lumps or a powder. Increasing the size of the lumps decreases the surface area exposed to the acid. This reduces the number of calcium carbonate particles available for collision at any given moment, which in turn decreases the frequency of effective collisions, thus decreasing the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer (A): increasing the concentration of the acid**\n\n    Increasing the concentration of the hydrochloric acid means there are more HCl particles per unit volume of the solution. This leads to more frequent collisions between the acid particles and the surface of the calcium carbonate. A higher frequency of collisions results in a higher frequency of effective collisions, which *increases* the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer (B): increasing the volume of the acid**\n\n    Increasing the volume of the acid, while keeping its concentration the same, increases the total amount (moles) of acid available for the reaction. However, the rate of reaction is determined by the concentration (the number of particles per unit volume), not the total volume. The frequency of collisions would remain the same, so the initial rate of reaction would not change. This change would only affect the total amount of product formed if the acid is the limiting reactant, not the rate at which it is formed.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer (D): increasing the temperature**\n\n    Increasing the temperature provides the reactant particles with more kinetic energy. This has two main effects: the particles move faster, leading to more frequent collisions, and, more importantly, a greater proportion of the colliding particles possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. Both of these factors lead to a higher frequency of effective collisions, which *increases* the rate of the reaction."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_93.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13 solid copper(ii) sulfate exists in two different forms, anhydrous and hydrated.\none of these forms is blue and the other is white.\nthe change between these two forms is reversible.\nblue form = white form\nwhat is the blue form and how is the change from the blue form to the white form brought about?\n[ee | ss\na anhydrous add water\nb anhydrous heat\ncc hydrated add water\nd hydrated heat", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nHydrated copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O) is a blue crystalline solid.

Carbon is a non-metal, and its oxide, carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083). It also reacts with bases like sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate and water. Thus, CO\u2082 is an acidic oxide.\n*   **Basic Oxides** are typically formed from metals.

The immediate next step is to separate the pure aqueous copper(II) chloride solution from the unwanted, unreacted solid. Filtration is the standard laboratory technique used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. The mixture is passed through filter paper; the solid copper(II) carbonate (the residue) is trapped by the paper, while the aqueous copper(II) chloride solution (the filtrate) passes through. This provides a pure solution from which solid crystals can then be obtained.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. crystallisation**\n\nCrystallisation is the process of forming solid crystals from a saturated solution, typically by cooling. While crystallisation is a necessary step to obtain solid copper(II) chloride, it is not the *next* step. It must be performed on a pure solution of copper(II) chloride. Attempting to crystallise the solution before removing the excess copper(II) carbonate would result in the solid salt being contaminated with the unreacted solid. Therefore, filtration must precede crystallisation.\n\n**B. evaporation**\n\nEvaporation is used to remove some of the solvent (water) from the solution to make it more concentrated or saturated, which facilitates crystallisation upon cooling. Similar to crystallisation, this step is performed on the pure copper(II) chloride solution *after* the excess solid has been removed. Therefore, filtration must be carried out before evaporation.\n\n**D. titration**\n\nTitration is a quantitative analytical technique used to determine the concentration of a reactant by reacting it with a precise volume of another reactant of known concentration.

This property follows a distinct trend across a period in the Periodic Table. As one moves from left to right across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases, leading to a stronger effective nuclear charge. This increased positive charge pulls the valence electrons more tightly, making them more difficult to remove. Consequently, metallic character decreases across a period.\n\n1.  **Statement 2: Beryllium is more metallic than carbon.**\n    *   Beryllium (Be) is in Group 2 and Carbon (C) is in Group 14. Both elements are in Period 2.\n    *   Since Beryllium is to the left of Carbon in the same period, it has a weaker hold on its valence electrons and is therefore more metallic.

These elements have metallic bonding, which is the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of positive metal ions and a sea of delocalised valence electrons. As you move down the group, the atoms get larger due to the addition of extra electron shells. This increases the distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised electrons, weakening the metallic bond. Less energy is required to overcome these weaker bonds, resulting in lower melting points.\n\n**Density:** The density of Group I elements generally increases as the group is descended. Density is calculated as mass divided by volume. While the atomic volume increases down the group, the atomic mass increases more significantly due to the addition of more protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The greater increase in mass relative to volume leads to an overall increase in density.\n\n**Reactivity:** The reactivity of Group I elements increases as the group is descended. Reactivity for these metals is determined by their ability to lose their single outermost electron. As you go down the group, the outermost electron is in a shell further from the nucleus. This greater distance, combined with increased shielding from the inner electron shells, reduces the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron. Consequently, the electron is lost more easily, making the elements more reactive.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly states that melting point increases, density decreases, and reactivity decreases. As explained for the correct answer, the melting point decreases due to weaker metallic bonding, density generally increases because the increase in atomic mass outpaces the increase in atomic volume, and reactivity increases because the outermost electron is more easily lost down the group.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the melting point increases and density decreases. While it correctly identifies that reactivity increases, the trends for the other two properties are wrong. The melting point decreases down the group as the atoms become larger and the metallic bonds weaken. The density generally increases down the group because the atomic mass increases more significantly than the atomic volume.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option incorrectly states that reactivity decreases. Although it correctly identifies that the melting point decreases and density increases, the trend for reactivity is incorrect. The reactivity of Group I metals increases down the group. This is because the outermost electron becomes progressively easier to remove as the atomic size increases and the shielding effect becomes more pronounced, leading to more vigorous reactions for elements lower in the group."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_100.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "20 which row describes a similarity and a difference between chlorine and bromine?\n[sia aitrence\n\na both are gases at room chlorine and bromine\n\ntemperature and pressure have different colours\nb both exist as chlorine is more\n\ndiatomic molecules dense than bromine\n\ncc both have atoms with only bromine will react with\n\nseven outer-shell electrons aqueous sodium chloride\nd both react with aqueous chlorine is more reactive\n\npotassium iodide than bromine", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\n**Similarity:** Both chlorine and bromine are more reactive than iodine.

The reactivity of halogens (their ability to act as oxidising agents) decreases down the group. Chlorine is in Period 3, while bromine is in Period 4. A chlorine atom has fewer electron shells than a bromine atom, meaning its outer shell is closer to the nucleus. This results in a stronger electrostatic attraction for an incoming electron, making chlorine more reactive.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A:** The statement of similarity is incorrect. At room temperature and pressure (RTP), chlorine is a pale-green gas, but bromine is a reddish-brown liquid. The physical state of halogens changes from gas to liquid to solid as you go down the group due to the increasing strength of intermolecular van der Waals forces.\n\n**B:** The statement of difference is incorrect. Density increases down Group 17. Bromine atoms are larger and have a greater atomic mass than chlorine atoms. The particles are also packed more closely together in the liquid state (bromine) than in the gaseous state (chlorine). Consequently, bromine is denser than chlorine. The similarity, that both exist as diatomic molecules (Cl\u2082 and Br\u2082), is correct.\n\n**C:** The statement of difference is incorrect. Halogen reactivity decreases down the group (Fluorine > Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine). A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halide from its salt solution. Since bromine is less reactive than chlorine, it cannot displace chloride ions from aqueous sodium chloride. No reaction would occur.

In this case, zinc (Zn), a reactive metal, is added to dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). According to the reactivity series, zinc is more reactive than hydrogen. This means that zinc will displace hydrogen from the acid in a single displacement reaction.\n\nThe zinc atoms lose electrons to form zinc ions (Zn\u00b2\u207a), while the hydrogen ions (H\u207a) from the acid gain electrons to form hydrogen gas (H\u2082). The chloride ions (Cl\u207b) from the acid combine with the zinc ions to form the salt, zinc chloride (ZnCl\u2082), which remains dissolved in the solution.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\nZn(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 ZnCl\u2082(aq) + H\u2082(g)\n\nAs the equation shows, the gaseous product of this reaction is hydrogen.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: carbon dioxide**\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is produced when an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or a metal hydrogencarbonate. The reactants in this scenario are zinc metal and hydrochloric acid. Since there are no carbon atoms present in either reactant, it is impossible for carbon dioxide to be formed as a product.\n\n**B: chlorine**\nChlorine gas (Cl\u2082) is not produced in this reaction. The chlorine atoms from the hydrochloric acid exist as chloride ions (Cl\u207b). These ions combine with the newly formed zinc ions (Zn\u00b2\u207a) to create the aqueous salt zinc chloride (ZnCl\u2082). The production of chlorine gas from hydrochloric acid typically requires a strong oxidizing agent (such as manganese(IV) oxide) and often concentrated acid, conditions which are not met here.\n\n**D: oxygen**\nOxygen gas (O\u2082) cannot be a product of this reaction. The law of conservation of mass dictates that atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. The reactants are zinc (Zn) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Aluminium is a metal characterised by its low density (approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3) and high strength-to-weight ratio, particularly when combined with other elements to form alloys. In aircraft manufacturing, minimising weight is crucial for fuel efficiency, payload capacity, and overall performance. The low density of aluminium allows for the construction of a light yet strong airframe. Additionally, aluminium naturally forms a protective oxide layer that resists corrosion, which is a vital property for a vehicle exposed to diverse atmospheric conditions.\n\n**B. copper**\nCopper is not used for the main structure of aircraft because it is a very dense metal (approximately 8.96 g/cm\u00b3), nearly three times denser than aluminium. While it is strong and an excellent conductor of electricity (making it ideal for electrical wiring within the aircraft), its high weight would make the aircraft prohibitively heavy, inefficient, and difficult to fly.\n\n**C. iron**\nIron is a strong metal, but like copper, it is very dense (approximately 7.87 g/cm\u00b3). Using iron or its main alloy, steel, for the majority of an aircraft's structure would result in an excessively heavy vehicle, which would require enormous amounts of power to fly and be highly uneconomical. Furthermore, iron is susceptible to corrosion (rusting), which compromises structural integrity and would require constant, heavy maintenance.\n\n**D. potassium**\nPotassium is an alkali metal and is completely unsuitable for aircraft manufacture. Although it has a very low density (0.86 g/cm\u00b3), it is extremely soft and has virtually no structural strength. More importantly, potassium is highly reactive; it reacts explosively with water and readily oxidises in air.

It is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction that requires the presence of both oxygen and water. In this electrochemical process, iron is oxidised (loses electrons) to form iron(II) ions. Oxygen, dissolved in water, is reduced (gains electrons). These initial products then undergo further reactions to form hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O), the reddish-brown substance known as rust. Water acts as a crucial medium (an electrolyte) for the ions to move and is also a reactant in the overall process. Therefore, both oxygen and water are essential for iron to rust.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. oxygen only**\nWhile oxygen is the primary oxidising agent that reacts with iron during rusting, it cannot cause rust to form in the complete absence of water. The rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that requires an electrolyte to facilitate the movement of ions. Water serves this purpose. In a perfectly dry environment, even if oxygen is present, the lack of an aqueous medium means the electrochemical cell cannot be established, and rusting will not occur, or will be extremely slow.\n\n**C. water and carbon dioxide**\nThe fundamental chemical change in rusting is the oxidation of iron by oxygen. Without oxygen, iron will not rust. While the presence of carbon dioxide can accelerate the rate of rusting because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083), making the water slightly acidic and a better electrolyte, it is not a required reactant. Oxygen is the essential oxidising agent, not carbon dioxide.\n\n**D. water only**\nWater alone is insufficient to cause rusting. The process requires an oxidising agent to react with the iron, and this role is filled by oxygen from the air. This can be demonstrated by placing an iron nail in boiled water (to remove dissolved gases like oxygen) and sealing it from the air; in this case, the nail will not rust. Oxygen must be dissolved in the water for the oxidation of iron to take place."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_108.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "28 part of the reactivity series of metals is shown.\nmetalp decreasing\nreactivity\ncarbon\nmetal q\nmetal r\nwhich row shows how each metal is extracted from its ore?\n[ree [meat\na electrolysis of molten ore electrolysis of molten ore heating with carbon\nb heating with carbon electrolysis of molten ore electrolysis of molten ore\ncc heating with carbon heating with carbon electrolysis of molten ore\nd electrolysis of molten ore heating with carbon heating with carbon", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "***\n\n### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe method used to extract a metal from its ore is determined by the metal's reactivity. The reactivity series provided shows the order of reactivity as P > carbon > Q > R.\n\n*   **Metal P:** This metal is more reactive than carbon. Because of its high reactivity, its ore is very stable and cannot be reduced by carbon. A more powerful and energy-intensive method is required. Therefore, metal P must be extracted by the electrolysis of its molten ore.\n\n*   **Metal Q and Metal R:** Both metals Q and R are less reactive than carbon. This means that carbon is reactive enough to displace them from their compounds (ores). This process, known as reduction, is achieved by heating the metal ore with carbon (usually in the form of coke) in a furnace. This is the most common and economical method for metals with reactivity lower than carbon.\n\nTherefore, the correct methods are electrolysis for P, and heating with carbon for both Q and R.\n\n***\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n#### A: electrolysis of molten ore | electrolysis of molten ore | heating with carbon\n\nThis option is incorrect because it proposes that metal Q is extracted by electrolysis. Metal Q is below carbon in the reactivity series, indicating it is less reactive than carbon. Consequently, it can be extracted more economically by reduction with carbon. Electrolysis is an energy-intensive process reserved for metals that are more reactive than carbon.\n\n#### B: heating with carbon | electrolysis of molten ore | electrolysis of molten ore\n\nThis option is incorrect for all three metals. Metal P is more reactive than carbon, so it cannot be extracted by heating with carbon; it requires electrolysis. Metals Q and R are both less reactive than carbon and are therefore extracted by heating with carbon, not by the more powerful method of electrolysis.\n\n#### C: heating with carbon | heating with carbon | electrolysis of molten ore\n\nThis option is incorrect because it reverses the extraction methods for the most and least reactive metals shown.

In this process, water is passed through layers of filter media, such as sand and gravel. These media act as a physical barrier, trapping solid particles like silt, organic debris, and flocculated matter, while allowing the clear water to pass through. This effectively separates the insoluble solids from the liquid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** The primary purpose of chlorination in water treatment is disinfection, not the general removal of impurities. Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, thereby making the water safe for consumption. While microorganisms are a type of impurity, the main role of chlorination is specifically to sterilise the water, rather than to physically remove other types of impurities like dissolved or suspended solids.\n\n**C:** Sedimentation is a process used to remove *insoluble* solids, not soluble solids. During sedimentation, water is allowed to stand in a large tank, enabling heavier, suspended particles (like sand and silt) to settle to the bottom under gravity. Soluble solids are dissolved in the water and will not settle out; they remain in the solution and require different methods for removal, such as distillation or reverse osmosis.\n\n**D:** The use of activated carbon (charcoal) in water treatment is primarily for the removal of dissolved impurities that cause unpleasant tastes, odours, and colours. Activated carbon works through a process called adsorption, where these dissolved substances stick to its highly porous surface.

Ammonium nitrate (NH\u2084NO\u2083) is a source of **Nitrogen (N)**. However, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)\u2082) does not provide any of the three primary NPK nutrients. Furthermore, calcium hydroxide is an alkali which, when mixed with an ammonium salt like ammonium nitrate, will react to produce ammonia gas (NH\u2083).

In this process, many small, unsaturated molecules, called monomers, join together to form a very large, single molecule called a polymer.\n\n1.  **Reaction R:** The reaction is an **addition** reaction. The starting material, ethene (CH\u2082=CH\u2082), is an alkene, which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon because it contains a carbon-carbon double bond.

Seawater is a solution of salts dissolved in water. Water has a boiling point of 100\u00b0C, while the salts have much higher boiling points. When seawater is heated, the water evaporates to form steam, leaving the dissolved salts behind. This steam is then cooled in a condenser, where it turns back into liquid water. The resulting liquid is pure water, free from dissolved salts, and is suitable for drinking. This specific application of distillation to remove salt from water is known as desalination.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. crystallisation**\nCrystallisation is a process for separating a dissolved solid solute from a solution to form solid crystals. If seawater were subjected to crystallisation (for example, by evaporating the water), the salt would be recovered as solid crystals. The purpose of this process is to obtain the salt, not the pure water. The remaining liquid would become an even more concentrated salt solution, not drinking water.\n\n**C. filtration**\nFiltration is a technique used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid.

In a compound like water (H\u2082O), the constituent elements (hydrogen and oxygen) are joined by strong chemical bonds (covalent bonds). These bonds cannot be broken by physical processes such as boiling, filtering, or magnetism. To separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, a chemical reaction must occur to break these bonds. For example, electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electricity to decompose water into its elements, hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. This requirement for a chemical change to separate constituent elements is a fundamental property of all compounds.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a molecule of water can be separated using physical means.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes the property of a mixture, not a compound. The components of a mixture are not chemically bonded and can be separated by physical methods. For instance, a mixture of sand and water can be separated by filtration. Because the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a water molecule are chemically bonded, they cannot be separated by physical means.\n\n**C. The number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a molecule of water is variable.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining feature of a compound is that its elements are present in a fixed ratio by mass, as stated by the Law of Definite Proportions. Every molecule of water has the chemical formula H\u2082O, meaning it always contains exactly two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. If the ratio of atoms were variable, it would be a mixture, not a specific compound.\n\n**D. Water has the same chemical properties as both hydrogen and oxygen.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. When elements chemically combine to form a compound, a new substance is created with properties that are entirely different from those of its constituent elements. For example, water is a stable, liquid that can extinguish fires. In contrast, hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and oxygen is a gas that is essential for combustion. The distinct properties of water compared to hydrogen and oxygen demonstrate that a chemical change has occurred and a new compound has been formed."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_123.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "3 anatom of element x contains:\n\ne 5protons\ne 6 neutrons\ne 5electrons.\n\nwhich statements about element x are correct?\n1. xhas an atomic number of 6.\n2  xhas anucleon number of 11.\n3  xisin group il of the periodic table.\n4  xis inthe second period of the periodic table.\n\na iand3 b 1and4 c 2and3 d 2and4", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D (2 and 4)\n\nStatement 2 is correct.

It consists of discrete molecules where the atoms within each molecule are held together by strong covalent bonds.

However, it incorrectly states that the volume of oxygen collected is 30 cm\u00b3. The stoichiometry of the electrode reactions dictates that the volume ratio of hydrogen produced to oxygen produced is 2:1.

In this experiment, the mass of the fuel (5 g) and the volume of water (50 cm\u00b3) are kept constant for all four trials. Therefore, the amount of energy absorbed by the water is directly proportional to the change in temperature (\u0394T). To identify the fuel that releases the most energy, one must calculate the temperature change for each fuel.\n\nFor fuel C, the temperature change is:\n\u0394T = Final Temperature - Initial Temperature\n\u0394T = 47\u00b0C - 28\u00b0C = 19\u00b0C\n\nThis is the largest temperature increase among all the fuels tested (A: 8\u00b0C, B: 10\u00b0C, D: 18\u00b0C). A larger temperature change in the same mass of water indicates that more heat energy has been transferred, meaning fuel C released the most energy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe energy released by a fuel is determined by the magnitude of the temperature change it causes in the water, not the initial or final temperatures alone. For fuel A, the temperature change is calculated as follows:\n\u0394T = 23\u00b0C - 15\u00b0C = 8\u00b0C\n\nThis temperature rise of 8\u00b0C is the smallest of the four fuels.

For fuel B, the temperature change is:\n\u0394T = 31\u00b0C - 21\u00b0C = 10\u00b0C\n\nWhile this represents more energy released than fuel A (which caused an 8\u00b0C rise), it is significantly less than the temperature change caused by fuel C (19\u00b0C) and fuel D (18\u00b0C). Therefore, fuel B did not release the most energy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nIt is a common misconception to assume the fuel that results in the highest final temperature released the most energy.

Because fuel C produced a larger temperature change, it transferred more energy to the water."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_132.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "12 which changes increase the rate of reaction?\n1 increasing the concentration of the reactants\n2 __ increasing the particle size of a solid reactant\n3. increasing the temperature\na 1,2and3 b 1and2only c 1and3only d = 2and3only", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "The correct answer is **C**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis question assesses the understanding of the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction, which is explained by the collision theory. According to collision theory, for a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with sufficient energy (equal to or greater than the activation energy) and with the correct orientation.\n\n1.  **Increasing the concentration of the reactants:** This change increases the number of reactant particles in a given volume. With more particles in the same space, the frequency of collisions between them increases. A higher frequency of collisions leads to a higher frequency of effective collisions, thus increasing the rate of reaction. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.\n\n2.  **Increasing the particle size of a solid reactant:** This change *decreases* the rate of reaction. For a given mass of a solid, larger particles have a smaller total surface area compared to smaller particles (like a powder). Chemical reactions involving a solid can only occur on its surface. By increasing the particle size, the available surface area for reaction is reduced, which decreases the frequency of collisions between the solid and other reactants. To increase the rate, one must *decrease* the particle size to increase the surface area. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Increasing the temperature:** This change increases the average kinetic energy of the reactant particles. This has two consequences:\n    *   The particles move faster, leading to more frequent collisions.\n    *   More importantly, a significantly larger proportion of particles will have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. This means that the frequency of effective (successful) collisions increases dramatically.\n    Both effects lead to a faster rate of reaction. Therefore, statement 3 is correct.\n\nSince only statements 1 and 3 describe changes that increase the rate of reaction, the correct option is **C (1 and 3 only)**.\n\n*   **Option A (1, 2 and 3)** is incorrect because statement 2 describes a change that decreases the reaction rate.\n*   **Option B (1 and 2 only)** is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect.\n*   **Option D (2 and 3 only)** is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_133.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13. which reaction is reversible?\na aniron nail rusting when left in moist air\nb limestone reacting with an acid to form carbon dioxide gas\nc magnesium burning in air to produce a white ash\nd_ white anhydrous copper(ii) sulfate turning blue when water is added", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct answer is **D**. The reaction of white anhydrous copper(II) sulfate with water is a classic example of a reversible reaction.\n\n*   **Forward Reaction:** When water is added to white, powdery anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\u2084), it turns into blue, crystalline hydrated copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O). This is an exothermic process.\n    *   CuSO\u2084(s) + 5H\u2082O(l) \u2192 CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O(s)\n\n*   **Reverse Reaction:** If the blue hydrated copper(II) sulfate is gently heated, the water of crystallisation is driven off as steam, and the solid turns back into white anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. This is an endothermic process.\n    *   CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O(s) \u2192 CuSO\u2084(s) + 5H\u2082O(g)\n\nSince the reaction can proceed in both directions by changing the conditions (adding water or adding heat), it is defined as reversible. This reaction is often used as a chemical test for the presence of water.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A) an iron nail rusting when left in moist air:** Rusting is the corrosion of iron, a chemical reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O). This is a complex oxidation process. While the iron oxide can be converted back to iron (for example, in a blast furnace), this requires extreme conditions and different reactants. The process of rusting itself is not simply reversed by removing the moist air, and is therefore considered an irreversible chemical change.\n\n*   **B) limestone reacting with an acid to form carbon dioxide gas:** Limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO\u2083) reacts with an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl) in a neutralisation reaction to produce a salt, water, and carbon dioxide gas: CaCO\u2083(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 CaCl\u2082(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + CO\u2082(g). Because carbon dioxide is a gas, it typically escapes from the reaction mixture. The loss of a product from the system prevents the reverse reaction from occurring, driving the reaction to completion. Therefore, it is an irreversible reaction.\n\n*   **C) magnesium burning in air to produce a white ash:** The burning of magnesium in air is a combustion reaction. Magnesium reacts vigorously with oxygen to form magnesium oxide (2Mg + O\u2082 \u2192 2MgO), a stable white solid. This reaction is highly exothermic, releasing a large amount of energy as heat and light. Decomposing the very stable magnesium oxide back into magnesium and oxygen requires a substantial input of energy (e.g., through electrolysis) and cannot be achieved by a simple reversal of conditions.

In the given reaction, iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) is converted into iron (Fe). This transformation involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the iron(III) oxide.\n\nTo analyze this using oxidation states:\n*   In the reactant Fe\u2082O\u2083, oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Therefore, each iron atom must have an oxidation state of +3 to balance the charge (2 x (+3) + 3 x (-2) = 0).\n*   In the product Fe, iron is in its elemental form, so its oxidation state is 0.\n\nSince the oxidation state of iron decreases from +3 to 0, and the compound loses oxygen, iron(III) oxide has undergone reduction.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n#### B: precipitation\nA precipitation reaction is one in which two soluble ionic compounds in aqueous solution react to form an insoluble solid product, known as a precipitate. The reaction shown (2Fe\u2082O\u2083 + 3C \u2192 4Fe + 3CO\u2082) does not involve aqueous solutions reacting to form an insoluble solid. Instead, it shows a reaction between two solids (iron(III) oxide and carbon) to produce a solid (iron) and a gas (carbon dioxide). Therefore, this is not a precipitation reaction.\n\n#### C: oxidation\n**Oxidation** is the chemical process that is the opposite of reduction. It can be defined as the gain of oxygen, the loss of electrons, or an increase in oxidation state. In this reaction, iron(III) oxide *loses* oxygen, it does not gain it. It is the carbon (C) that is oxidized, as it gains oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and its oxidation state increases from 0 to +4. Since the question asks what happens to iron(III) oxide, oxidation is the incorrect description.\n\n#### D: combustion\nCombustion is a high-temperature exothermic redox reaction between a fuel and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, to produce oxidized, often gaseous products in a mixture termed as smoke. While the reaction of carbon is an oxidation process and the overall reaction is highly exothermic (as in a blast furnace), the term \"combustion\" is not the most accurate or specific description for the change that iron(III) oxide undergoes.

Using an excess of the insoluble reactant (magnesium oxide) is crucial to ensure that all the acid is completely neutralized. This prevents the final salt product from being contaminated with unreacted sulfuric acid. The reaction continues until no more magnesium oxide dissolves, indicating the acid has been fully consumed. The chemical equation for this neutralization reaction is:\n    MgO(s) + H\u2082SO\u2084(aq) \u2192 MgSO\u2084(aq) + H\u2082O(l)\n\n2.  **Filtration:** After the reaction, the mixture contains the desired soluble product (magnesium sulfate solution) and the unreacted solid excess magnesium oxide.

Excess sulfuric acid is reacted with magnesium oxide. The mixture is evaporated to dryness.**\n\nThis method is incorrect because it uses an excess of sulfuric acid.

Evaporating this mixture to dryness would result in a final solid that is not pure magnesium sulfate but a mixture contaminated with sulfuric acid.\n\n**B. Excess sulfuric acid is reacted with magnesium oxide. The precipitate is filtered, washed and dried.**\n\nThis method is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, as with option A, using excess sulfuric acid would lead to a contaminated product. Secondly, the product of the reaction, magnesium sulfate, is a soluble salt. It dissolves in water to form a solution and does not form a precipitate. Therefore, there would be no precipitate of magnesium sulfate to filter.\n\n**D. Sulfuric acid is reacted with excess magnesium oxide. The precipitate is filtered, washed and dried.**\n\nWhile this method correctly starts by using excess magnesium oxide, the subsequent steps are incorrect for isolating the desired product.

The number of outer shell electrons also increases across a period. Element R has 2 outer shell electrons, placing it in Group 2. Element Q has 7 outer shell electrons, placing it in Group 17. Since Group 2 is to the left of Group 17, element R must be to the left of element Q in the same period. Therefore, the proton number of R is less than the proton number of Q.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Q is a metal and R is a non-metal.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The metallic character of an element is related to the number of electrons in its outer shell. Elements with a small number of outer shell electrons (typically 1, 2, or 3) tend to lose electrons and are classified as metals. Element R has 2 outer electrons, making it a metal (specifically, an alkaline earth metal). Elements with a large number of outer shell electrons (typically 5, 6, or 7) tend to gain electrons and are classified as non-metals.

The melting points of the alkali metals decrease down Group I. This is due to the weakening of the metallic bonds. Alkali metals are held together by the electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the delocalised sea of electrons. As you descend the group, the atomic radius increases. This means the outermost (delocalised) electron is further away from the positive nucleus, and there is more shielding by inner electron shells. Consequently, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the delocalised electrons weakens, requiring less energy to overcome these forces and melt the solid. Since sodium is above potassium in Group I, it has stronger metallic bonds and therefore a higher melting point than potassium.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Lithium is more dense than sodium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The general trend for density in Group I is that it increases down the group. This is because although the atomic volume increases, the atomic mass increases more significantly. Lithium (0.53 g/cm\u00b3) is less dense than sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3). Both are less dense than water and will float.\n\n**B. Sodium is more reactive than potassium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of alkali metals increases as you go down Group I. Reactivity is determined by how easily an atom can lose its single outer shell electron. As you descend the group, the atomic radius increases, and the shielding effect of inner electrons becomes greater. This reduces the electrostatic attraction between the positive nucleus and the valence electron, making it easier to lose. Therefore, potassium, being below sodium in the group, is more reactive than sodium.\n\n**D. They are in Group II of the Periodic Table.**\nThis statement is incorrect.

These properties arise from their unique electron configurations, specifically the presence of a partially filled d-subshell.\n\n1.  **Melting Point:** Transition elements have high melting points. This is due to strong metallic bonding. The atoms are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a lattice of positive metal ions and a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. In transition metals, electrons from both the outermost s-orbital and the inner d-orbital are delocalised, leading to a greater number of delocalised electrons per atom and thus stronger metallic bonds, which require a large amount of thermal energy to overcome.\n\n2.  **Density:** Transition elements have high densities. Density is a measure of mass per unit volume. Across a period, transition metals have a high atomic mass, but their atomic radii do not increase significantly. The increasing nuclear charge pulls the electron shells more tightly, counteracting the addition of electrons to an inner shell. This combination of a large mass packed into a relatively small volume results in high density.\n\n3.  **Formation of Coloured Compounds:** A characteristic feature of transition elements is their ability to form coloured compounds. This phenomenon is due to the presence of partially filled d-orbitals. In a compound, these d-orbitals split into different energy levels. Electrons can be promoted from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital by absorbing energy corresponding to specific wavelengths of visible light.

A key characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct heat and electricity effectively. This property, known as thermal conductivity, arises from the sea of delocalised electrons present in the metallic lattice structure. These electrons are free to move and can efficiently transfer kinetic energy (heat) throughout the material. Therefore, zinc is a good thermal conductor.\n\nFurthermore, the chemical reactivity of a metal with a dilute acid depends on its position in the reactivity series. Zinc is positioned above hydrogen in the series, which means it is more reactive than hydrogen. Consequently, zinc will displace hydrogen from dilute acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, to form a salt and hydrogen gas. The general reaction is:\nZinc + Dilute Acid \u2192 Zinc Salt + Hydrogen\nFor example: Zn(s) + H\u2082SO\u2084(aq) \u2192 ZnSO\u2084(aq) + H\u2082(g)\nThus, zinc does react with dilute acids. Both properties listed in this row are correct for zinc.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies zinc as a good thermal conductor due to its metallic nature and delocalised electrons. However, it incorrectly states that zinc does not react with dilute acids. Zinc is more reactive than hydrogen, as indicated by its position in the reactivity series. This means it will readily react with and displace hydrogen from dilute acids. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly states that zinc reacts with dilute acids because it is above hydrogen in the reactivity series. However, it incorrectly describes zinc as a poor thermal conductor. As a metal, zinc possesses a lattice of positive ions in a sea of delocalised electrons, which makes it an excellent conductor of heat. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly identifies both properties of zinc. Zinc is a metal and therefore a good thermal conductor, not a poor one. Additionally, zinc is above hydrogen in the reactivity series, meaning it does react with dilute acids, contrary to what is stated.

Food products can be acidic or contain salts and water, which can react with metals. If the container corrodes, the metal compounds could contaminate the food, making it unsafe for consumption, and the container could be weakened, leading to leaks. Therefore, resistance to corrosion is an essential property for this application.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** The primary property required for shaping metal into car bodies is malleability, which is the ability to be hammered or pressed into shape without breaking. While ductility (the ability to be drawn into a wire) and malleability are related properties of metals involving plastic deformation, malleability is the more specific and necessary property for this use. Other properties like strength and resistance to corrosion are also crucial.\n*   **B:** While metals are generally good conductors of heat, this is not a desirable property for cutlery. If cutlery conducted heat very well, the handle of a spoon in hot soup or a fork used with hot food would quickly become too hot to hold comfortably. The key properties for cutlery are resistance to corrosion (from food and washing) and hardness.\n*   **D:** Overhead electrical cables are suspended over long distances between pylons. A metal with high density would be very heavy, requiring stronger, more numerous, and more expensive support pylons to prevent sagging or breaking. Therefore, a *low* density is a desirable property for this use.

The primary pollutants responsible for acid rain are sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) and oxides of nitrogen (NO\u2093).\n\n*   **Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082):** This gas is released into the atmosphere primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, like coal and oil, which contain sulfur impurities. Industrial processes such as smelting also release SO\u2082. In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide reacts with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084), a strong acid.\n*   **Oxides of Nitrogen (NO\u2093):** These gases, mainly nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), are formed during high-temperature combustion processes, such as in vehicle engines and power stations. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form nitric acid (HNO\u2083), another strong acid.\n\nWhen these strong acids mix with water droplets in clouds, they fall to the earth as acid rain, causing significant environmental damage to forests, lakes, and buildings.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide**\nThis option is incorrect because carbon monoxide (CO) is a neutral oxide. It does not react with water to form an acid and therefore does not contribute to acid rain. While carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) dissolves in atmospheric water to form weak carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083), this process accounts for the natural, slight acidity of normal rainwater (pH \u2248 5.6). It is not considered a primary cause of the environmental problem of acid rain, which involves significantly increased acidity due to industrial pollutants.\n\n**B: carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen**\nThis option is incorrect because, as explained above, carbon monoxide (CO) is a neutral oxide and does not cause acid rain. Although oxides of nitrogen are a major contributor, both compounds in the option must contribute for the answer to be correct.\n\n**D: sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide**\nThis option is incorrect because while sulfur dioxide is a major cause of acid rain, carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant in this context. Carbon dioxide is responsible for the natural background acidity of rain. The term \"acid rain\" as an environmental issue refers specifically to the additional, much stronger acidity caused by pollutants like sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen.

Iron (Fe) is above hydrogen in the reactivity series and reacts with HCl (Fe + 2HCl \u2192 FeCl\u2082 + H\u2082).\n*   **Metal Q:** The statement \"Q reacts violently with water\" points to a very reactive metal, typically a Group 1 alkali metal. Potassium (K) is at the top of the reactivity series and reacts explosively with water.\n*   **Metal R:** The statement \"R reacts with water to give hydrogen\" indicates a reactive metal, but the lack of the adverb \"violently\" suggests it is less reactive than Q. Sodium (Na) is just below potassium in the reactivity series and also reacts vigorously with water. The distinction in descriptions fits the relative reactivity of potassium (Q) and sodium (R).\n*   **Metal S:** The statement \"S is formed by heating its oxide with carbon\" describes extraction by carbon reduction. This method is used for metals that are less reactive than carbon, such as zinc, iron, and lead. Zinc oxide can be reduced by carbon (ZnO + C \u2192 Zn + CO).\n\nThe combination in row D (P=iron, Q=potassium, R=sodium, S=zinc) correctly matches all the described properties.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: copper, sodium, potassium, iron**\nThis option is incorrect because metal P is identified as copper. Copper is below hydrogen in the reactivity series and therefore does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce hydrogen gas. Additionally, the description implies Q is more reactive than R (\"violently\" vs. \"reacts\"), but this option identifies Q as sodium and R as potassium, which is the reverse of their actual reactivity with water (potassium is more reactive than sodium).\n\n**B: zinc, magnesium, calcium, iron**\nThis option is incorrect because metal Q is identified as magnesium. While magnesium is a reactive metal, its reaction with cold water is very slow. It does not react \"violently\" with water as described in the question. A violent reaction with water is characteristic of Group 1 metals like sodium or potassium.\n\n**C: zinc, sodium, calcium, magnesium**\nThis option is incorrect because metal S is identified as magnesium. The statement says S is formed by reducing its oxide with carbon. Magnesium is a highly reactive metal, more reactive than carbon. Its oxide (MgO) is too stable to be reduced by carbon. Magnesium is extracted by electrolysis of its molten chloride, not by carbon reduction."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_147.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 which compound is formed when iron rusts?\na anhydrous iron(ii) oxide\nb anhydrous iron(ii) oxide\nc hydrated iron(iii) hydroxide\nd hydrated iron(iii) oxide", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nRusting is the common term for the corrosion of iron, an electrochemical process that requires the presence of both oxygen and water.

The process of rusting requires water, and the final product is hydrated (contains water molecules). Furthermore, while iron(II) ions (Fe\u00b2\u207a) are formed as an intermediate step in the rusting process, they are further oxidised to the more stable iron(III) state (Fe\u00b3\u207a) found in rust.\n\n**B. anhydrous iron(III) oxide**\nThis is incorrect. While the iron in rust is indeed in the iron(III) state (Fe\u00b3\u207a), the term \"anhydrous\" is inaccurate. Rust specifically refers to the hydrated form of iron(III) oxide.

In its anhydrous (water-free) state, cobalt(II) chloride is blue. When it comes into contact with water, it becomes hydrated and changes colour to pink. Therefore, the purpose of placing cobalt(II) chloride paper in the gas jar is to detect the water produced during the combustion of the candle wax.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. carbon dioxide**\nWhile carbon dioxide is a major product of the combustion of hydrocarbons, it is not detected by cobalt(II) chloride paper. The standard chemical test for carbon dioxide is to bubble the gas through limewater (an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide). The limewater turns milky or cloudy in the presence of carbon dioxide due to the formation of a white precipitate of calcium carbonate.\n\n**B. carbon monoxide**\nCarbon monoxide is a product of the *incomplete* combustion of hydrocarbons, which occurs when the supply of oxygen is limited.

The primary macronutrients required by plants are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Nitrogen is a vital component of many organic molecules essential for plant life, including amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and chlorophyll (the pigment necessary for photosynthesis).\n\nThe chemical formula for urea is CO(NH\u2082)\u2082. This formula shows that each molecule of urea contains two nitrogen atoms. When urea is added to the soil, it is hydrolysed by enzymes into ammonia (NH\u2083) and carbon dioxide. The ammonia is then converted into ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a) and subsequently nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) ions, which are forms of nitrogen that can be readily absorbed by plant roots.

The double bond in the ethene molecule breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each of the two carbon atoms.\n\nThe reaction is:\nCH\u2082=CH\u2082 (ethene) + Br\u2082 (bromine) \u2192 CH\u2082Br-CH\u2082Br (1,2-dibromoethane)\n\nThe product, 1,2-dibromoethane, is a colourless compound. As the reddish-brown bromine is consumed in the reaction, its colour disappears. This rapid decolourisation of aqueous bromine is the characteristic chemical test for an unsaturated compound containing a C=C double bond.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: ethane**\nEthane (C\u2082H\u2086) is an alkane. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they only contain carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C). Because they are saturated, they do not undergo addition reactions. Alkanes can react with bromine in a substitution reaction, but this process is slow and requires the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. Without UV light, ethane will not react with aqueous bromine, and therefore will not decolourise it.\n\n**B: ethanoic acid**\nEthanoic acid (CH\u2083COOH) is a carboxylic acid. It is a saturated compound as it only contains carbon-carbon single bonds in its structure. While it contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) within the carboxyl functional group, this bond is not reactive towards bromine in an addition reaction. Therefore, ethanoic acid will not decolourise aqueous bromine.\n\n**C: ethanol**\nEthanol (CH\u2083CH\u2082OH) is an alcohol. It is a saturated compound, containing only carbon-carbon single bonds. As it lacks a carbon-carbon double bond, it cannot undergo an addition reaction with bromine. Ethanol does not react with aqueous bromine under normal conditions and thus will not cause decolourisation."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_155.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "35 compound z has the molecular formula c2h,o.\nwhich statement about compound z is correct?\na zis unsaturated.\nb  zisacarboxylic acid.\nc_ zis formed by the reaction of ethane with steam.\nd zis used as a fuel.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe molecular formula C\u2082H\u2086O corresponds to ethanol (CH\u2083CH\u2082OH). Ethanol undergoes complete combustion in the presence of sufficient oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing a significant amount of energy. This exothermic reaction makes it a useful fuel. It is widely used as a biofuel, often blended with petrol. The balanced chemical equation for its combustion is:\nC\u2082H\u2085OH (l) + 3O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2CO\u2082 (g) + 3H\u2082O (l)\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Z is unsaturated.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A saturated compound is one that contains only single bonds between its carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated alcohol is C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082O. For a compound with two carbon atoms (n=2), this formula becomes C\u2082(H\u2082\u2093\u2082+\u2082)O, which is C\u2082H\u2086O. Since the molecular formula of compound Z matches the general formula for a saturated alcohol, it is a saturated compound. Its structure, CH\u2083-CH\u2082-OH, confirms that there is only a single bond between the two carbon atoms.\n\n**B. Z is a carboxylic acid.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Carboxylic acids are organic compounds that contain the carboxyl functional group (-COOH). This functional group consists of one carbon atom double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to another oxygen atom, which is part of a hydroxyl group. Therefore, all carboxylic acids contain at least two oxygen atoms. Compound Z has the formula C\u2082H\u2086O, which contains only one oxygen atom, and thus cannot be a carboxylic acid. The two-carbon carboxylic acid is ethanoic acid, which has the molecular formula C\u2082H\u2084O\u2082.\n\n**C. Z is formed by the reaction of ethane with steam.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Ethanol (Compound Z) is manufactured industrially by the hydration of **ethene** (C\u2082H\u2084), not **ethane** (C\u2082H\u2086), with steam. This reaction is carried out at high temperature and pressure, using a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst.

In the standard notation for an atom, `^A_Z X`, `A` represents the mass number (the total number of protons and neutrons), and `Z` represents the atomic number (the number of protons).\n\nFor the two isotopes shown, `^m_n S` and `^p_q S`:\n*   `m` and `p` are the mass numbers.\n*   `n` and `q` are the atomic numbers.\n\n**Statement 2: n = q**\nIsotopes are atoms of the same element. The identity of an element is defined by its atomic number (the number of protons). Therefore, all isotopes of a given element must have the same atomic number. In this case, both symbols are for isotopes of element S, so their atomic numbers must be equal. Thus, **n = q**. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Statement 3: m > q**\nThis statement compares the mass number of one isotope (`m`) with the atomic number of the other (`q`). The mass number (`m`) is the sum of the protons (`n`) and neutrons in the nucleus of the first isotope. The atomic number (`q`) is the number of protons in the nucleus of the second isotope.\nWe can write this as: `m` = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons).\nWe know that `q` = (number of protons).\nSince we have already established that `n = q`, we are comparing `m` with `q`.\nSo, `m` = `q` + (number of neutrons).\nFor this inequality (`m > q`) to be true, the number of neutrons must be greater than zero. All atomic nuclei, with the single exception of the protium isotope of hydrogen (`\u00b9H`), contain neutrons. Since the element is S (Sulfur, atomic number 16), its atoms certainly contain neutrons.

As a general rule, ionic compounds formed from Group 1 metals, such as potassium, are soluble in water. Water is a polar solvent, meaning its molecules have a slight positive and a slight negative charge. These polar water molecules are attracted to the positively charged potassium ions (K\u207a) and the negatively charged fluoride ions (F\u207b) in the crystal lattice. The attraction between the water molecules and the ions is strong enough to overcome the electrostatic forces holding the ions together in the lattice. This process, known as hydration, causes the ions to separate and become surrounded by water molecules, resulting in the compound dissolving to form an aqueous solution.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It can conduct electricity when it is solid.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Potassium fluoride is an ionic compound that exists as a giant ionic lattice in the solid state. For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile charge carriers (either delocalised electrons or mobile ions). In solid potassium fluoride, the potassium (K\u207a) and fluoride (F\u207b) ions are held in fixed positions within the lattice and are not free to move. Therefore, solid ionic compounds like potassium fluoride cannot conduct electricity. They only conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water, as in these states the ions are free to move and carry an electric current.\n\n**C. It has a low melting point.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Potassium fluoride is an ionic compound with a giant ionic lattice structure. The positive potassium ions (K\u207a) and negative fluoride ions (F\u207b) are held together by very strong electrostatic forces of attraction. A large amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these strong forces and break down the rigid lattice structure, allowing the ions to move freely as a liquid. Consequently, ionic compounds like potassium fluoride have high melting and boiling points. Low melting points are characteristic of simple molecular substances, which have weak intermolecular forces between molecules.\n\n**D. It is a molecule.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Potassium fluoride is an ionic compound, not a molecule. A molecule is a discrete particle consisting of a specific number of atoms joined by covalent bonds. Potassium fluoride is formed by the transfer of an electron from a potassium atom (metal) to a fluorine atom (non-metal), creating ions (K\u207a and F\u207b). These ions are arranged in a continuous three-dimensional crystal lattice structure held together by strong electrostatic forces.

Each of the four hydrogen atoms possesses one outer-shell electron. To achieve a stable electron configuration, the carbon atom forms a single covalent bond with each of the four hydrogen atoms. In this process, the carbon atom shares all four of its valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom shares its single valence electron. Consequently, a total of eight valence electrons are involved in forming the four C-H bonds, and there are no non-bonding electrons (lone pairs) on any of the atoms. Therefore, all outer-shell electrons in the CH\u2084 molecule are involved in covalent bonding.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Cl\u2082**\nA chlorine atom has seven outer-shell electrons. In a chlorine molecule (Cl\u2082), the two chlorine atoms each contribute one electron to form a single covalent bond. This allows both atoms to achieve a stable octet.

Thus, not all outer-shell electrons are involved in covalent bonding.\n\n**C) HCl**\nIn a hydrogen chloride molecule (HCl), the hydrogen atom has one outer-shell electron, and the chlorine atom has seven. They form a single covalent bond by sharing one electron each. While hydrogen's only outer-shell electron is used in bonding, the chlorine atom has six remaining outer-shell electrons that are not part of the covalent bond.

Water itself also partially dissociates to produce a small concentration of hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b).\n\nThe anode is the positive electrode, so it attracts negatively charged ions (anions). The anions present in the solution are sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b).\n\nAccording to the rules of selective discharge, there is competition between these two anions at the anode. The ion that is more easily oxidised (loses electrons) will be discharged. Hydroxide ions are more easily oxidised than sulfate ions.

The formation of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) would require the decomposition or oxidation of the sulfate ion (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b).

The acid reacts with the base in a neutralization reaction:\n    HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H\u2082O(l)\n\n3.  **Final State:** The problem states that *excess* hydrochloric acid is added. This means that enough acid is added to completely neutralize all the sodium hydroxide, and then more acid is added.

Chlorine (Cl) and Bromine (Br) are both in Group 17 of the Periodic Table, the halogens. A key periodic trend for the halogens is that their density increases as you go down the group. Since bromine is in Period 4, below chlorine which is in Period 3, bromine has a larger atomic mass and its molecules are packed more closely in its liquid state compared to chlorine's gaseous state at room temperature. Therefore, bromine has a greater density than chlorine.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Bromine is a gas at room temperature and pressure.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As you descend Group 17, the strength of the intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces) between the diatomic molecules (e.g., Cl\u2082, Br\u2082, I\u2082) increases. This is because the number of electrons per molecule increases, leading to stronger temporary dipoles. This increase in intermolecular forces results in higher melting and boiling points. At room temperature and pressure, chlorine is a gas, bromine is a volatile red-brown liquid, and iodine is a solid.\n\n**C. Bromine has a grey-black colour.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The colours of the halogens become progressively darker down the group. Bromine is a red-brown liquid. The halogen that is a grey-black solid at room temperature is iodine, which is located below bromine in Group 17.\n\n**D. Bromine is less reactive than iodine.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of the halogens decreases as you go down Group 17. Reactivity for these non-metals is defined by their ability to gain an electron to form a halide ion. As you go down the group, the atomic radius increases, and the outer electron shell is further from the positively charged nucleus. Increased electron shielding from inner shells also weakens the nucleus's attraction for an incoming electron. Since bromine is above iodine in Group 17, it can attract an electron more easily and is therefore more reactive than iodine. This is demonstrated by the ability of bromine to displace iodine from its salt solutions (e.g., Br\u2082(aq) + 2KI(aq) \u2192 2KBr(aq) + I\u2082(aq))."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_181.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 what is a typical property of transition elements?\na canactas catalysts\nb_ poor electrical conductivity\nclow melting point\nd_ low density", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation\n\n**A. can act as catalysts (Correct)**\n\nA defining characteristic of transition elements and their compounds is their catalytic activity. They can increase the rate of chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. This ability stems from two key features:\n1.  **Variable Oxidation States:** Transition elements can exist in multiple stable oxidation states (e.g., iron can be Fe\u00b2\u207a or Fe\u00b3\u207a). This allows them to participate in redox reactions by forming unstable intermediate compounds, which then decompose to form the final products and regenerate the catalyst.\n2.  **Surface Adsorption:** They can provide a large surface area onto which reactant molecules can adsorb (form weak bonds), increasing the concentration of reactants at the surface and weakening their existing bonds, thus lowering the activation energy of the reaction.\n\nCommon examples include iron in the Haber process for ammonia synthesis and vanadium(V) oxide in the Contact process for sulfuric acid production.\n\n**B. poor electrical conductivity (Incorrect)**\n\nTransition elements are metals and, like all metals, are excellent electrical conductors. Metals possess a giant metallic lattice structure consisting of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not bound to any single atom and are free to move throughout the structure. When a potential difference (voltage) is applied, these mobile electrons flow towards the positive terminal, creating an electric current. Therefore, poor electrical conductivity is a property of non-metals, not transition elements.\n\n**C. low melting point (Incorrect)**\n\nTransition elements typically have very high melting and boiling points. This is due to the strength of the metallic bonding within their structure. The electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the delocalised electrons is very strong. Transition elements contribute electrons from both their outermost s-orbital and their inner d-orbitals to the 'sea' of delocalised electrons. This large number of delocalised electrons results in exceptionally strong metallic bonds, which require a great deal of energy to overcome, leading to high melting points. In contrast, elements like the alkali metals (Group 1) have low melting points due to weaker metallic bonding.\n\n**D. low density (Incorrect)**\n\nTransition elements are characterised by high densities. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. Transition elements have relatively high atomic masses and their atoms are packed tightly and efficiently in a metallic lattice. This means a large amount of mass is contained within a small volume, resulting in high density. This is in stark contrast to metals in Group 1 (like sodium and potassium), which have low densities and can even float on water."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_182.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "22 which description of elements in group viii of the periodic table is correct?\na they are diatomic.\nb_ all atoms have eight outer electrons.\nc_ they have high melting points.\nd_ they are unreactive.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nElements in Group VIII, also known as the noble gases, are characterised by having a full outer shell of electrons. This complete valence shell makes them electronically stable. Because they are already stable, they have a very low tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons to form chemical bonds with other atoms. Consequently, the noble gases are chemically unreactive, or inert.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) They are diatomic.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Diatomic elements exist as molecules containing two atoms bonded together (e.g., O\u2082, N\u2082). The elements in Group VIII are monatomic, meaning they exist as individual, unbonded atoms. Their stable electron configuration (a full outer shell) means they do not need to form covalent bonds to achieve stability.\n\n**B) All atoms have eight outer electrons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While most noble gases (Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon) have eight electrons in their outermost shell (a stable octet), the first element in the group, Helium (He), is an exception. Helium's atomic number is 2, and its first and only electron shell is full with just two electrons. Since the statement claims this is true for \"all\" atoms in the group, the exception of Helium makes it false.\n\n**C) They have high melting points.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The noble gases have very low melting and boiling points. They exist as individual atoms held together by weak intermolecular forces of attraction (van der Waals forces).

Copper has high ductility.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Ductility is a physical property of metals that describes their ability to be stretched or drawn into a thin wire without fracturing. Copper is a highly ductile metal, which, combined with its excellent electrical conductivity, makes it an ideal material for manufacturing electrical wires.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Aluminium is more dense than copper.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. Copper has a density of approximately 8.96 g/cm\u00b3, while aluminium has a much lower density of approximately 2.70 g/cm\u00b3. Therefore, copper is more than three times denser than aluminium. This lower density is why aluminium is used in applications where a lightweight but strong metal is needed, such as in aircraft construction.\n\n**B. Aluminium is less reactive than copper.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of a metal is its tendency to undergo chemical reactions. According to the metal reactivity series, aluminium is placed significantly higher than copper, indicating that aluminium is a more reactive metal. While aluminium often appears unreactive in everyday situations, this is due to the rapid formation of a very thin, tough, and unreactive layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface when exposed to air. This oxide layer protects the underlying metal from further reaction.\n\n**D. Copper has poor electrical conductivity.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Electrical conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct an electric current. As a typical metal, copper has a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons that are free to move and carry charge.

Water from a reservoir contains suspended particles like sand, silt, leaves, and other debris. Filtration involves passing the water through beds of sand and gravel. These layers act as a physical barrier, trapping the insoluble solids and allowing clearer water to pass through.\n\n2.  **Process 2: Chlorination.** Although filtration removes solid particles, it does not remove dissolved substances or microscopic organisms such as bacteria and viruses, which can cause diseases. Therefore, after filtration, the water is disinfected. Chlorination is the process of adding a controlled amount of chlorine to the water. Chlorine is a powerful oxidising agent that kills these harmful microorganisms, making the water safe to drink.\n\nThis sequence, filtration followed by chlorination, is the standard and most effective method for treating municipal water supplies.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: chlorination followed by filtration**\nThis order of processes is incorrect and inefficient. If chlorination were performed first, the chlorine would be used up reacting with the large amount of organic matter (like leaves and twigs) present in the unfiltered water, reducing its effectiveness in killing harmful microorganisms. It is much more effective to first remove the bulk of solid impurities through filtration and then use chlorine to disinfect the clarified water.\n\n**C: fractional distillation followed by filtration**\nFractional distillation is a laboratory or industrial process used to separate liquids with different boiling points. It is not used for purifying municipal water supplies because it is extremely energy-intensive and expensive, making it completely impractical for the vast quantities of water required by a city. Furthermore, if water were purified by distillation, it would already be pure H\u2082O, and a subsequent filtration step would be redundant.\n\n**D: filtration followed by fractional distillation**\nWhile the first step, filtration, is correct, the second step is not.

It is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. For rusting to occur, both oxygen and water must be present. In this process, iron (Fe) is oxidised to form iron(III) ions (Fe\u00b3\u207a), while oxygen (O\u2082) is reduced. The overall simplified equation for the formation of rust is:\n    4Fe(s) + 3O\u2082(g) + 2nH\u2082O(l) \u2192 2Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O(s)\n    As shown in the equation, oxygen is a crucial reactant. Without it, the oxidation of iron cannot take place.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer A:** Rust is not anhydrous iron(II) oxide. The chemical name for rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide, and its formula is Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O. The term \"hydrated\" indicates that water molecules are incorporated into its chemical structure. \"Anhydrous\" means without water. Furthermore, the iron in rust is in the +3 oxidation state (iron(III)), not the +2 oxidation state (iron(II)).\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer C:** Covering iron with grease is a method of rust prevention known as barrier protection. The grease creates an impermeable layer that prevents both oxygen and water from coming into contact with the iron surface. Since oxygen and water are essential for rusting, this coating significantly slows down or stops the rusting process, rather than accelerating it.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer D:** Air contains approximately 21% oxygen, which is essential for rusting. In the absence of air, there is no supply of oxygen. Therefore, iron will not rust, or the process will be extremely slow if trace amounts of dissolved oxygen are present in water.

Hot air is blasted into the bottom of the furnace, reacting with the coke in the reaction: C(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g). This reaction releases a very large amount of energy, raising the temperature to over 1500\u00b0C.\n\n*   **Statement 2 is correct.** The main reducing agent responsible for converting iron(III) oxide into iron is carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is produced in the furnace when carbon dioxide, formed from the initial combustion of coke, reacts with more hot coke: CO\u2082(g) + C(s) \u2192 2CO(g).

In its anhydrous (water-free) state, it is blue. When it comes into contact with water, it becomes hydrated and turns pink. Since tap water is composed almost entirely of water molecules (H\u2082O), it will cause anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride paper or powder to turn from blue to pink.\n\n*   **Statement 4 is correct.** Phosphates are key components of many agricultural fertilisers. When these fertilisers are washed off farmland into rivers and lakes, the excess phosphate nutrients stimulate the rapid growth of algae and other aquatic plants, a process known as eutrophication. When this large amount of plant life dies, it is decomposed by aerobic bacteria. This decomposition process consumes large quantities of dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to deoxygenation. The resulting low oxygen levels can be fatal to fish and other aquatic organisms.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n**A (1 and 2)**\n*   This option is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Distilled water is water that has been purified by distillation, a process that removes dissolved salts, minerals, and other non-volatile substances. Tap water, while treated to be safe for consumption, still contains dissolved minerals and chemicals like chlorine.

It is highly soluble in water and provides an excellent source of nitrogen, an essential macronutrient for plants. Nitrogen is a key component of chlorophyll, which is vital for photosynthesis, and of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Ammonium nitrate is particularly effective because it supplies nitrogen in two forms that plants can readily absorb through their roots: the ammonium ion (NH\u2084\u207a) and the nitrate ion (NO\u2083\u207b). This promotes vigorous leaf and stem growth, leading to improved overall plant health and yield.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) phosphoric acid**\nWhile phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for plant growth, vital for root development and energy transfer (ATP), phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084) itself is not applied directly to the soil. Phosphoric acid is a corrosive substance that would significantly lower the soil's pH, creating highly acidic conditions that are detrimental to most plants and beneficial soil microorganisms. Instead, farmers use neutralized forms, such as phosphate salts (e.g., calcium superphosphate), to provide phosphorus in a safe and accessible form for plants.\n\n**C) potassium**\nPotassium is an essential macronutrient for plants, often referred to as the \"quality\" nutrient, as it is crucial for functions like water regulation, enzyme activation, and disease resistance. However, farmers do not use elemental potassium. Potassium is a highly reactive alkali metal that reacts violently with water. Applying it directly to moist soil would be extremely dangerous and would not deliver the nutrient in a form that plants can use. Instead, stable potassium compounds (salts), such as potassium chloride (KCl) or potassium sulfate (K\u2082SO\u2084), are used in fertilizers.\n\n**D) sodium oxide**\nSodium oxide (Na\u2082O) is not used to improve plant growth. Sodium is not an essential macronutrient for most crops, and high concentrations in the soil are typically toxic to plants. Sodium oxide is a basic oxide which reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong alkali.

Carbon monoxide is dangerous because it binds irreversibly to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen.\n*   **Pollutant Y is methane.** Methane (CH\u2084) is a hydrocarbon produced naturally through the anaerobic decomposition (decomposition without oxygen) of organic matter, such as vegetation in swamps, wetlands, and landfill sites. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in the atmosphere more effectively than carbon dioxide, thereby contributing significantly to global warming.\n*   **Pollutant Z is oxides of nitrogen.** Oxides of nitrogen (NOx, primarily NO and NO\u2082) are produced at high temperatures, such as those found in internal combustion engines and power station furnaces.

A titration is a precise analytical technique used to determine the concentration of a solution. It requires the controlled addition of one solution (the titrant) to another until the reaction is complete, which is observed by an indicator changing colour. A burette is a long, graduated glass tube with a stopcock at the lower end. This design allows for the slow, drop-by-drop addition of the titrant (the hydrochloric acid) and enables the precise measurement of the volume delivered, typically to an accuracy of \u00b10.05 cm\u00b3. This high degree of precision is essential for the subsequent calculations in a titration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: beaker**\nA beaker is a general-purpose piece of laboratory glassware used for holding, mixing, and heating liquids. While it may have volume markings, these are only approximate and are not intended for accurate measurements. A beaker does not have a mechanism, like a stopcock, to control the delivery of a liquid in small, precise amounts, making it completely unsuitable for use as the primary dispensing tool in a titration.\n\n**C: measuring cylinder**\nA measuring cylinder is used for making approximate measurements of liquid volumes. While it is more accurate than a beaker, it is significantly less precise than a burette. Furthermore, a measuring cylinder is designed for measuring a single volume, not for dispensing a variable volume in a controlled, dropwise manner. The level of accuracy provided by a measuring cylinder is insufficient for the calculations required to obtain a reliable result from a titration experiment.\n\n**D: pipette**\nA pipette is used to accurately measure and transfer a single, fixed volume of a liquid.

This phenomenon is a key indicator of a substance's purity. Pure water has a fixed melting point of 0 \u00b0C and a fixed boiling point of 100 \u00b0C at standard atmospheric pressure.\n\n1.  **Melting Point Depression:** A dissolved impurity disrupts the formation of the regular, ordered crystalline structure of ice. This interference means that a lower temperature is required for the water to freeze. Consequently, the melting point of the solution is lower than that of pure water (below 0 \u00b0C). A melting point of -3 \u00b0C is a plausible value for impure water.\n\n2.  **Boiling Point Elevation:** The dissolved impurity particles lower the solution's vapour pressure. For a liquid to boil, its vapour pressure must equal the surrounding atmospheric pressure. Since the vapour pressure of the impure water is lower at any given temperature compared to pure water, a higher temperature is needed to raise the vapour pressure to equal the atmospheric pressure. Thus, the boiling point of the solution is higher than that of pure water (above 100 \u00b0C). A boiling point of 104 \u00b0C is a plausible value for impure water.\n\nTherefore, the correct option shows a melting point below 0 \u00b0C and a boiling point above 100 \u00b0C.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: melting point +3 \u00b0C, boiling point 96 \u00b0C\n\nThis option is incorrect as it describes effects opposite to those caused by impurities. Dissolving an impurity in water causes the melting point to decrease (not increase to +3 \u00b0C) and the boiling point to increase (not decrease to 96 \u00b0C). A pure substance has fixed melting and boiling points, and impurities broaden this range by lowering the melting point and raising the boiling point.\n\n#### B: melting point +3 \u00b0C, boiling point 104 \u00b0C\n\nThis option is incorrect because it shows an increase in the melting point. While the boiling point is correctly shown as elevated (104 \u00b0C is above 100 \u00b0C), the presence of a dissolved impurity causes freezing point depression, which means the melting point must be *lower* than the 0 \u00b0C melting point of pure water, not higher.\n\n#### C: melting point -3 \u00b0C, boiling point 96 \u00b0C\n\nThis option is incorrect because it shows a decrease in the boiling point. While the melting point is correctly shown as depressed (-3 \u00b0C is below 0 \u00b0C), the presence of a dissolved impurity causes boiling point elevation. This means the boiling point must be *higher* than the 100 \u00b0C boiling point of pure water, not lower."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_200.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "40 element x burns in air to form an acidic gas that decolourises potassium manganate(vii).\nwhat is x?\na carbon\nb_ nitrogen\nc magnesium\nd \u00a9 sulfur", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe element that fits all the described properties is sulfur.\n1.  **Burns in air:** Sulfur is a non-metal that readily burns in air (reacting with oxygen) with a characteristic blue flame. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    S(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 SO\u2082(g)\n2.  **Forms an acidic gas:** The product of this combustion is sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), which is a gas at room temperature. Sulfur dioxide is an acidic oxide because it dissolves in water to form an acidic solution, sulfurous acid (H\u2082SO\u2083).\n3.  **Decolourises potassium manganate(VII):** Sulfur dioxide is a reducing agent. When bubbled through an acidified solution of potassium manganate(VII) (KMnO\u2084), it reduces the purple manganate(VII) ion (MnO\u2084\u207b, with manganese in the +7 oxidation state) to the colourless manganese(II) ion (Mn\u00b2\u207a, with manganese in the +2 oxidation state). This reaction causes the distinct purple colour of the solution to disappear, which is a standard chemical test for sulfur dioxide.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: carbon**\nWhile carbon burns in air to produce carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), which is an acidic gas, carbon dioxide is not a reducing agent. It cannot reduce potassium manganate(VII) and therefore will not decolourise the purple solution. The carbon atom in CO\u2082 is already in its highest possible oxidation state (+4).\n\n**B: nitrogen**\nNitrogen is the most abundant gas in the air and is generally unreactive. It does not \"burn\" in the air under normal conditions. Although it can be made to react with oxygen at very high temperatures (e.g., in a car engine or lightning) to form nitrogen oxides which are acidic, it does not combust in the manner described.\n\n**C: magnesium**\nMagnesium is a reactive metal that burns in air with a bright white flame.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. As the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy of the sodium atoms also decreases, causing them to move more slowly.\n\nThe boiling point of sodium is 890 \u00b0C. This is the temperature at which sodium changes between the liquid and gaseous states. Since both the initial (950 \u00b0C) and final (900 \u00b0C) temperatures are above the boiling point, the sodium remains in the gaseous state throughout this change. A change of state, such as condensation (gas to liquid), is required for bonds (intermolecular forces) to be systematically formed. Because there is no change of state, bonds are neither broken nor formed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: The atoms move more quickly and bonds are formed.**\nThis is incorrect. A decrease in temperature causes atoms to lose kinetic energy and move more slowly, not more quickly. Furthermore, bonds are formed during condensation, which occurs at the boiling point (890 \u00b0C). Since the temperature remains above the boiling point, the sodium stays as a gas and no bonds are formed.\n\n**B: The atoms move more quickly and bonds are neither broken nor formed.**\nThis is incorrect because a decrease in temperature causes the atoms to move more slowly.

Although the atoms do move more slowly due to the decrease in temperature, bonds are not formed. The formation of bonds between atoms would occur during a change of state from gas to liquid (condensation), which happens at the boiling point of 890 \u00b0C.

At a high temperature, gas particles have high kinetic energy and move randomly at high speeds. This rapid movement increases the rate at which they collide with each other and with the walls of the container.\n*   **Effect of Pressure:** Pressure is related to the number of particles per unit volume. At a high pressure, the gas particles are compressed into a smaller volume. This reduces the average distance between particles, making collisions more probable and therefore more frequent.\n\nCombining these two effects\u2014particles moving very fast (high temperature) in a confined space (high pressure)\u2014results in the highest possible frequency of collisions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because while high pressure increases collision frequency, low temperature decreases it. High pressure forces the gas particles closer together, which on its own would lead to more frequent collisions. However, a low temperature means the particles have low average kinetic energy and are moving slowly. This slow movement reduces the number of collisions that occur in a given period. The effect of the low temperature counteracts the effect of the high pressure, resulting in a collision frequency that is lower than at high temperature and high pressure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect because while high temperature increases collision frequency, low pressure decreases it. A high temperature gives the particles high kinetic energy, causing them to move rapidly, which on its own would lead to more frequent collisions. However, at low pressure, the particles are spread far apart in a large volume. The increased distance between particles means they must travel further before encountering another particle, which reduces the frequency of collisions. The effect of the low pressure counteracts the effect of the high temperature, resulting in a collision frequency that is lower than at high pressure and high temperature.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option describes the conditions for the lowest frequency of collisions. Both low pressure and low temperature contribute to reducing the rate of collisions.\n\n*   **Low Pressure:** The particles are far apart, meaning they travel longer distances between collisions.\n*   **Low Temperature:** The particles have low kinetic energy and move slowly, further reducing the number of collisions per unit of time.\n\nSince both factors work to decrease the collision rate, this combination results in the least frequent collisions."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_203.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "3 the diagram shows some properties of particles in an atom.\nto which labelled part of the diagram do electrons belong?\nfound outside\nnucleus\nrelative mass relative\nless than 1 charge of 1\u2014", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nElectrons are subatomic particles with a specific set of properties.

The ions present in the solution are hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) from the acid, and hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) from the partial dissociation of water. At the negative electrode (cathode), hydrogen ions are reduced to form hydrogen gas (2H\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 H\u2082). At the positive electrode (anode), hydroxide ions are preferentially oxidised over sulfate ions to form oxygen gas and water (4OH\u207b \u2192 O\u2082 + 2H\u2082O + 4e\u207b). Both hydrogen gas and oxygen gas are colourless.\n    **Statement 2 is correct.** For electrolysis to occur, a substance must contain mobile ions that are free to move and carry an electric current. Lead(II) bromide is an ionic compound. In its solid state, the lead(II) ions (Pb\u00b2\u207a) and bromide ions (Br\u207b) are held in a fixed crystal lattice and cannot move. However, when lead(II) bromide is melted, the ions become mobile and can conduct electricity, allowing electrolysis to take place.\n\n*   **Explanation for Incorrect Option B**\n    Statement 1 is correct, but statement 3 is incorrect. During the electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide, the positively charged lead(II) ions (Pb\u00b2\u207a) are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode). At the cathode, they gain electrons (are reduced) to form molten lead metal (Pb\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Pb). The positive electrode (anode) attracts the negatively charged bromide ions (Br\u207b). Therefore, lead is formed at the negative electrode, not the positive one.\n\n*   **Explanation for Incorrect Option C**\n    Statement 2 is correct, but statement 3 is incorrect. Lead is formed at the negative electrode (cathode), not the positive electrode (anode). Positively charged lead(II) ions (cations) migrate to the negatively charged cathode to be reduced to lead metal.\n\n*   **Explanation for Incorrect Option D**\n    Both statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.\n    Statement 3 is incorrect because lead metal is formed at the negative electrode (cathode), where positive Pb\u00b2\u207a ions are reduced.\n    Statement 4 is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) are anions (negatively charged ions) and would be attracted to the positive electrode (anode), not the negative electrode. Secondly, during the electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid, sulfate ions are not discharged or produced; they remain in the solution as spectator ions.

At the anode (negative electrode), hydrogen molecules are oxidised (lose electrons), typically forming hydrogen ions: H\u2082 \u2192 2H\u207a + 2e\u207b. The oxidation state of hydrogen increases from 0 to +1.

A fuel cell is specifically designed to convert the chemical energy stored in the fuel (hydrogen) directly into **electrical energy**.

To achieve the shortest reaction time, the reaction rate must be maximized.\n\n1.  **Effect of Concentration:** The rate of reaction increases as the concentration of the reactants increases. This is because a higher concentration means there are more reactant particles in a given volume, which leads to a higher frequency of collisions between them, and thus a faster reaction. In this experiment, the concentration of hydrochloric acid is decreased by adding water. To keep the concentration as high as possible, the smallest volume of water should be added. The options provide for adding 10 cm\u00b3 or 40 cm\u00b3 of water. Adding 10 cm\u00b3 of water results in a more concentrated acid solution than adding 40 cm\u00b3.\n\n2.  **Effect of Temperature:** The rate of reaction increases as the temperature increases. At higher temperatures, particles have more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently. More importantly, a higher proportion of these collisions will have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy, leading to more successful (reaction-forming) collisions per unit of time. The options provide for temperatures of 30 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C. The reaction will be faster at the higher temperature of 50 \u00b0C.\n\nTo achieve the fastest reaction rate and therefore the shortest time, the conditions must be a high concentration of acid (least water added) and a high temperature. Option B combines the smallest volume of added water (10 cm\u00b3) with the highest temperature (50 \u00b0C).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option uses the smallest volume of added water (10 cm\u00b3), which correctly provides a high concentration of hydrochloric acid. However, it uses the lower temperature (30 \u00b0C). A higher temperature would increase the kinetic energy of the particles, leading to more frequent and more energetic collisions, and thus a faster reaction. Therefore, the conditions in option B (50 \u00b0C) would result in a shorter reaction time.\n\n**C:** This option combines both the conditions that slow down a reaction: a low concentration of acid (due to adding a large volume of water, 40 cm\u00b3) and a low temperature (30 \u00b0C). The low concentration reduces the frequency of collisions, and the low temperature means fewer collisions have sufficient energy to result in a reaction. This combination would lead to the slowest reaction rate and the longest reaction time.\n\n**D:** This option uses the higher temperature (50 \u00b0C), which is a condition for a fast reaction. However, it uses a large volume of added water (40 cm\u00b3), which significantly dilutes the hydrochloric acid, lowering its concentration. A lower concentration reduces the frequency of collisions between reactant particles. Although the temperature is high, the low concentration will slow the reaction rate compared to a situation with a higher concentration at the same temperature (as in option B)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_215.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "15 the rate of reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid is investigated.\nthe total volume of hydrogen given off is measured at different times.\na graph of the results is shown.\n25 fee\n0\ns000 ee\nptt ttt rrr err rr errr ops tr tast tt ttt ttr tt\n20-feeeeeeeeeeeeee eee ree pepe eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ee eeeh\n0 ee\nsees ee ae ee ee ee eee\ntotal ecee cece ccc ee eee eee]\nts =eeee eere eere eee eee eee eee eee ee eee eee\nvolume of feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh\nhydrogen 9 perera eee eere eeeee eee eee\n/om? 10 a 9 op yl a |\npeele eeeeeeeeeeee ee eeeeeee eee ee eee eee\ns000 606 oe ee\nb-cecereeceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eee eee\nsep) 60060 oe ee\npoze cece ece ee]\na a sw eg a pp od\n0 ls a a ey a |\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\ntime/s\nwhich conclusions are correct?\n1 the rate is fastest between 0 and 30 seconds.\n2 the maximum volume of hydrogen given off is 22 cm?.\n3 at40 seconds, 20cm? of hydrogen is given off.\na jiand2only b tand3only c 2and3only d 1,2and3", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Analysis of Statement 1:** The rate of a reaction can be determined from the gradient (steepness) of the curve on a graph of product volume versus time. A steeper gradient indicates a faster reaction rate. The graph shows that the curve is steepest at the beginning of the reaction (between 0 and 30 seconds) and gradually becomes less steep.

The reaction is between a base (calcium hydroxide) and an ammonium salt. The products are a neutral salt (calcium nitrate), water, and a weak base (ammonia). No acid is formed in this reaction. Therefore, the reaction does not make the soil acidic again; in fact, the purpose of adding calcium hydroxide was to reduce the soil's acidity.\n\n**C: It makes nitrogen gas, so less nitrogen is absorbed by the soil.**\nThis is incorrect. While it is true that the loss of nitrogen as a gas makes the fertiliser less effective, the gas produced in this specific reaction is ammonia (NH\u2083), not nitrogen gas (N\u2082). The reaction between an alkali and an ammonium salt characteristically produces ammonia gas.\n\n**D: It makes the fertiliser too strong, stopping the plants growing well.**\nThis is incorrect.

Oxides of non-metals are typically acidic. This means they react with water to form an acid or with a base to form a salt and water. Specifically, nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to form a mixture of nitric acid (HNO\u2083) and nitrous acid (HNO\u2082), confirming its acidic character.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Nitrogen dioxide is a solid at room temperature.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082) is a simple molecular substance with weak intermolecular forces of attraction between its molecules. Consequently, it has a low boiling point of 21.2 \u00b0C.

Sodium oxide (Na\u2082O) is an ionic compound with a giant ionic lattice structure. The electrostatic forces of attraction between the positive sodium ions (Na\u207a) and negative oxide ions (O\u00b2\u207b) are very strong and require a large amount of energy to overcome. This results in a very high melting point (1132 \u00b0C).

Chemical bonding between a metal and a non-metal typically involves the transfer of electrons to form ions. In sodium oxide, each of two sodium atoms donates one electron to an oxygen atom, forming two positive sodium ions (Na\u207a) and one negative oxide ion (O\u00b2\u207b).

It reacts with sulfuric acid to produce magnesium sulfate (a soluble salt) and hydrogen gas. The correct method would be to add an excess of magnesium metal to the acid. Once the reaction is complete, the unreacted magnesium would be removed by filtration. This is not a titration.\n\n**D) zinc carbonate:**\nZinc carbonate (ZnCO\u2083) is an insoluble carbonate.

This is because the atoms become larger, and the metallic bonds between them become weaker. The valence electron is further from the nucleus and more shielded, requiring less energy to overcome the forces of attraction. The data shows the melting point decreases from lithium (181 \u00b0C) to sodium (98 \u00b0C). Therefore, the melting point of rubidium, which is below sodium, must be lower than 98 \u00b0C. A value of 39 \u00b0C is consistent with this trend.\n2.  **Density:** As you descend Group I, the density generally increases. Although both atomic mass and atomic radius increase down the group, the increase in mass is more significant than the increase in volume. The data shows the density increases from lithium (0.53 g/cm\u00b3) to sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3). Therefore, the density of rubidium must be greater than 0.97 g/cm\u00b3. A value of 1.53 g/cm\u00b3 is consistent with this trend.\n\nSince both the melting point (39 \u00b0C) and density (1.53 g/cm\u00b3) in this option follow the established periodic trends, this is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:**\nThis option is incorrect because the value for density contradicts the established periodic trend. While the melting point of 39 \u00b0C correctly follows the trend of decreasing melting points down Group I (181 \u00b0C > 98 \u00b0C > 39 \u00b0C), the density of 0.38 g/cm\u00b3 is incorrect. Density increases down Group I, so the density of rubidium must be greater than that of sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3). A value of 0.38 g/cm\u00b3 incorrectly suggests a decrease in density.\n\n**C:**\nThis option is incorrect because both the melting point and the density contradict the established periodic trends.\n*   The melting point of 253 \u00b0C is incorrect. Melting points decrease down Group I, so rubidium's melting point must be lower than sodium's (98 \u00b0C), not higher.\n*   The density of 0.38 g/cm\u00b3 is incorrect. Density increases down Group I, so rubidium's density must be higher than sodium's (0.97 g/cm\u00b3), not lower.\n\n**D:**\nThis option is incorrect because the value for the melting point contradicts the established periodic trend.

Calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083), a metal carbonate, decomposes upon strong heating to produce calcium oxide (CaO), a metal oxide, and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\nCaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 CaO(s) + CO\u2082(g)\nThis process is a key industrial method for producing carbon dioxide and quicklime (calcium oxide).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Cracking of large hydrocarbon molecules**\n\nCracking is the process of breaking down large, long-chain hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more useful ones, such as shorter-chain alkanes and alkenes. This is achieved by using high temperatures and a catalyst. The process breaks carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds but does not introduce oxygen atoms, so carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is not a product. For example, cracking decane (C\u2081\u2080H\u2082\u2082) might produce octane (C\u2088H\u2081\u2088) and ethene (C\u2082H\u2084).\n\n**B. Photosynthesis**\n\nPhotosynthesis is a biological process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. During this process, carbon dioxide and water are taken from the environment and used to synthesise glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The overall equation is 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082.

When sulfur is burned, it produces a substance that causes acid rain.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The combustion of sulfur in the presence of oxygen produces sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), an acidic, non-metallic oxide. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\nS(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 SO\u2082(g)\n\nOnce released into the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to form acids. Sulfur dioxide can dissolve in water droplets to form sulfurous acid (H\u2082SO\u2083). More significantly, it can be further oxidised in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide (SO\u2083), which then dissolves in water to form sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084), a strong acid.\n\nSO\u2082(g) + H\u2082O(l) \u21cc H\u2082SO\u2083(aq)\n2SO\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 2SO\u2083(g)\nSO\u2083(g) + H\u2082O(l) \u2192 H\u2082SO\u2084(aq)\n\nThese acids lower the pH of rainwater, typically below 5.6, resulting in acid rain, which has harmful effects on the environment.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. Sulfur is produced by the thermal decomposition of limestone.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083). When heated strongly, a process known as thermal decomposition, it breaks down into calcium oxide (CaO), also called quicklime, and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The reaction does not produce sulfur or any sulfur compounds. The equation for this reaction is:\nCaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 CaO(s) + CO\u2082(g)\n\n**C. Compounds of sulfur make up approximately 1% of unpolluted air.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Unpolluted air consists mainly of nitrogen (approximately 78%) and oxygen (approximately 21%). The next most abundant gas is argon, which makes up about 0.93% of the air. The concentration of all other gases, including carbon dioxide (~0.04%), is less than 0.1%. Compounds of sulfur, such as sulfur dioxide, are present only in trace amounts in unpolluted air, far less than 1%.\n\n**D. Sulfur is a member of the family of elements called halogens.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The periodic table categorises elements into groups based on their properties. Sulfur (S) is located in Group 16. The elements in this group are known as the chalcogens. The halogens are the elements found in Group 17 of the periodic table, which include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).

According to the alkane general formula, C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082, a compound with 2 carbon atoms (n=2) should have 2(2) + 2 = 6 hydrogen atoms. The formula for the alkane would be C\u2082H\u2086 (ethane). The formula C\u2082H\u2084 fits the general formula for alkenes, C\u2099H\u2082\u2099, and represents the unsaturated hydrocarbon ethene.\n\n**B. C\u2083H\u2086**\nThis formula does not represent an alkane. For an alkane with 3 carbon atoms (n=3), the number of hydrogen atoms should be 2(3) + 2 = 8, giving the formula C\u2083H\u2088 (propane). The formula C\u2083H\u2086 fits the general formula for alkenes, C\u2099H\u2082\u2099.

It only contains single bonds between its atoms.**\n\nEthane (C\u2082H\u2086) is an alkane. The \"-ane\" suffix in its name indicates that it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated compound is one in which all the bonds between carbon atoms are single covalent bonds. The structure of ethane consists of two carbon atoms joined by a single bond, with each carbon atom also bonded to three hydrogen atoms via single bonds. Therefore, the molecule contains only single bonds.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It rapidly decolourises aqueous bromine.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The rapid decolourisation of aqueous bromine (from brown/orange to colourless) is the characteristic chemical test for an unsaturated compound, specifically one containing a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) or triple bond (C\u2261C), such as an alkene. This is an addition reaction. Ethane is a saturated alkane and lacks a C=C double bond, so it does not undergo an addition reaction with bromine under normal conditions. Alkanes can react with bromine in a substitution reaction, but this requires the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light and is not a rapid process.\n\n**B. It does not burn.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Ethane is a hydrocarbon, and like other alkanes, it is flammable. It undergoes complete combustion in the presence of sufficient oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing a significant amount of energy. The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of ethane is:\n2C\u2082H\u2086(g) + 7O\u2082(g) \u2192 4CO\u2082(g) + 6H\u2082O(l)\n\n**C.

This process utilises microorganisms, typically yeast, to convert a simple sugar, such as glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), into ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The reaction is catalysed by enzymes found in yeast (e.g., zymase) and must be carried out in anaerobic conditions (in the absence of oxygen) and at an optimal temperature (around 25-37\u00b0C).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the fermentation of glucose is:\nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086(aq) \u2192 2 C\u2082H\u2085OH(aq) + 2 CO\u2082(g)\n\nTherefore, glucose is the essential raw material for producing ethanol through fermentation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. carbon dioxide**\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a product of the fermentation process, not a raw material. As shown in the chemical equation for fermentation (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 \u2192 2 C\u2082H\u2085OH + 2 CO\u2082), carbon dioxide is produced alongside ethanol. Raw materials are the starting substances (reactants) that are consumed during a reaction.\n\n**B. ethene**\nEthene (C\u2082H\u2084) is used to produce ethanol in an industrial process called the catalytic hydration of ethene. In this process, ethene is reacted with steam (H\u2082O) at high temperature and pressure using a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst. While this is a major method for producing industrial ethanol, it is a different chemical pathway and is not fermentation. The question specifically asks for the raw material used in fermentation.\n\n**D. natural gas**\nNatural gas, which is primarily composed of methane (CH\u2084), is a fossil fuel. It is used mainly for heating and electricity generation.

The defining feature of any carboxylic acid is the presence of the carboxyl functional group. This functional group consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to another oxygen atom, which is in turn bonded to a hydrogen atom. The chemical representation of the carboxyl group is \u2013COOH. Therefore, the statement that ethanoic acid contains a \u2013COOH group is correct.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** Ethanoic acid is, as its name implies, an acid. In an aqueous solution, it partially dissociates to release hydrogen ions (H\u207a). The presence of these H\u207a ions makes the solution acidic. On the pH scale, acidic solutions have a pH value of less than 7. A pH greater than 7 indicates an alkaline (basic) solution, while a pH of 7 is neutral. Thus, an aqueous solution of ethanoic acid has a pH less than 7.\n\n**C:** The reaction between an acid and a metal carbonate produces a salt, water, and carbon dioxide gas. The specific reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate is:\n2CH\u2083COOH(aq) + Na\u2082CO\u2083(s) \u2192 2CH\u2083COONa(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + CO\u2082(g)\nThe gas produced in this reaction is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), not hydrogen (H\u2082). Hydrogen gas is typically produced when a reactive metal (one above hydrogen in the reactivity series) reacts with an acid.\n\n**D:** For a metal to react with an acid to produce a salt and hydrogen gas, the metal must be more reactive than hydrogen. According to the reactivity series, copper (Cu) is less reactive than hydrogen (H). Consequently, copper cannot displace hydrogen from ethanoic acid.

Many plastics, when subjected to combustion, release poisonous or harmful gases into the atmosphere. For instance, the incomplete combustion of any plastic (which are carbon-based polymers) produces carbon monoxide (CO), a toxic gas. Furthermore, some plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), contain chlorine atoms. When PVC is burned, it releases hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, which is highly corrosive and dissolves in atmospheric water droplets to form hydrochloric acid, a component of acid rain. Other toxic compounds, such as dioxins and furans, can also be formed, especially when various types of plastic waste are burned together. These emissions contribute significantly to air pollution and pose serious health risks to humans and other organisms.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Plastic waste contains many small molecules.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Plastics are polymers, which are very large molecules (macromolecules). They are formed through a process called polymerisation, where many small, repeating molecular units, known as monomers, are chemically bonded together to form long chains. The environmental persistence of plastics is largely due to the stability of these large, long-chain molecules, which are difficult for microorganisms to break down.\n\n**C. Plastic waste rapidly dissolves in the oceans.**\nThis statement is contrary to the observed evidence and a primary reason why plastic is a pollutant. Plastics are generally insoluble in water and are non-biodegradable. Instead of dissolving, they persist in the environment for hundreds or thousands of years. In oceans, they are broken down by sunlight and physical forces into smaller and smaller pieces called microplastics, but they do not dissolve. This persistence leads to problems such as the entanglement of marine life and the ingestion of plastic by animals, causing harm throughout the food web.\n\n**D. Plastic waste reacts with both acids and bases.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Most common plastics are valued for their chemical inertness, meaning they are unreactive towards many chemical substances, including weak acids and bases found in the environment (e.g., acid rain or alkaline soils). This lack of reactivity is a key reason why they are so persistent in landfills and natural ecosystems.

Adding water would result in a suspension containing both solid substances. Filtration would then simply collect the entire solid mixture back, and no separation would have occurred.\n\n**B: dissolve the mixture in water then crystallise**\nThis method is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as with option A, neither copper nor copper(II) oxide dissolves in water, so no solution is formed.

Since nothing dissolves, there is no solution from which to crystallise a substance.\n\n**D: react the mixture with dilute hydrochloric acid then crystallise**\nWhile reacting the mixture with dilute hydrochloric acid is the correct initial step, the subsequent step of crystallisation is incorrect for the purpose of separating the copper. After the reaction, the solid copper needs to be separated from the liquid copper(II) chloride solution.

This causes them to move rapidly and randomly in all directions. There are negligible forces of attraction between the particles, so they are not held in any fixed position or pattern. As a result, gas particles are completely disordered and have a random arrangement, spreading out to fill the entire volume of their container.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Gases are difficult to compress when pressure is applied.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Gases are, in fact, easy to compress. The particles in a gas are very far apart, with large empty spaces between them. When external pressure is applied, the particles can be easily forced closer together, significantly reducing the volume of the gas. This property distinguishes gases from liquids and solids, which are considered virtually incompressible because their particles are already packed closely together.\n\n**B. The particles in gases are close together.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining characteristic of the gaseous state is that its constituent particles are widely separated. The average distance between gas particles is much larger than the size of the particles themselves. This large intermolecular spacing is responsible for the low density and high compressibility of gases. In contrast, particles in liquids and solids are close together.\n\n**D. The particles in gases move slowly past each other.**\nThis statement is incorrect. According to the kinetic particle theory, particles in a gas have a high amount of kinetic energy, significantly more than in the liquid or solid state.

In this case, the argon atoms gain kinetic energy and move more rapidly and randomly. Since the gas is in a closed container, the volume is constant. The faster-moving argon atoms will collide with the inner walls of the container more frequently and with greater force. The combined effect of more frequent and more forceful collisions results in an increase in the pressure exerted by the gas.\n*   **Size:** The size of an atom is determined by its atomic structure, specifically the arrangement of its electrons in energy shells around the nucleus.

The main components of air are the elements nitrogen (N\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082), and the noble gas argon (Ar). However, air also contains significant amounts of compounds, most notably carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water vapour (H\u2082O). Because air contains compounds in addition to elements, the claim that it is a mixture of *only* gaseous elements is false.\n\n**B. Alloys are formed when a metal is ionically bonded to other elements.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An alloy is a mixture composed of at least one metal combined with other elements. The bonding within alloys is metallic bonding, not ionic bonding. In metallic bonding, the metal atoms are held together in a lattice structure by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons that are free to move throughout the structure. Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal, creating oppositely charged ions that are held together by electrostatic attraction. This is not the type of bonding found in alloys.\n\n**C. Carbon dioxide is a mixture of carbon and oxygen.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a compound, not a mixture. In a compound, elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio by mass. In carbon dioxide, one carbon atom is chemically bonded to two oxygen atoms. This chemical reaction forms a new substance with properties that are distinct from its constituent elements (carbon and oxygen). A mixture, by contrast, consists of two or more substances that are physically combined but not chemically bonded, and which retain their individual properties.\n\n**D. Potassium bromide is an ionic compound.**\n\nThis statement is correct. An ionic compound is formed from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, which are typically formed when a metal transfers electrons to a non-metal. Potassium (K) is an alkali metal in Group 1 of the periodic table, and bromine (Br) is a halogen (a non-metal) in Group 17. The potassium atom readily loses its single valence electron to form a positive ion (K\u207a), and the bromine atom gains one electron to complete its outer shell, forming a negative ion (Br\u207b). The strong electrostatic force of attraction between the K\u207a and Br\u207b ions forms an ionic bond, resulting in the ionic compound potassium bromide (KBr)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_244.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 which row identifies methods of testing the purity of a compound?\n([-metnaront [bar pit [ dronatonany |\na v v v\nb v x x\ncc v v x\nd x v v", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: A**\nThis row is correct because all three listed techniques\u2014melting point determination, boiling point determination, and chromatography\u2014are standard laboratory methods for assessing the purity of a chemical compound.\n*   **Melting Point:** A pure crystalline solid has a sharp, characteristic melting point. The presence of impurities disrupts the regular crystal lattice structure, causing the solid to melt at a lower temperature and over a wider range.\n*   **Boiling Point:** A pure liquid has a sharp, characteristic boiling point at a given atmospheric pressure. The presence of dissolved impurities raises the boiling point and causes the liquid to boil over a range of temperatures.\n*   **Chromatography:** This is a powerful separation technique. A pure substance will produce a single spot (in paper or thin-layer chromatography) or a single peak (in gas chromatography). An impure substance, being a mixture, will separate into multiple spots or peaks, indicating the presence of more than one component.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\nThis option is incorrect because it wrongly excludes boiling point and chromatography as methods for testing purity. While melting point is a valid test for the purity of solids, boiling point serves the same purpose for liquids. Chromatography is a highly sensitive and widely used technique for identifying impurities in both solid and liquid samples by separating the components of a mixture.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: C**\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes chromatography. Chromatography is a fundamental and highly effective technique for determining the purity of a substance. It works by separating the components of a mixture. If a substance is pure, it will not separate and will appear as a single spot or peak. The presence of multiple spots or peaks is a clear indication of impurities.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes melting point as a valid method. The determination of a substance's melting point is a classic and reliable test for the purity of a solid compound.

In covalent bonding, atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electronic configuration, which is typically that of a noble gas (a full outer shell of electrons).\n\n*   **In methane (CH\u2084):** A carbon atom (4 valence electrons) shares one electron with each of four hydrogen atoms (1 valence electron each).

This gives the nitrogen atom a full octet of 8 electrons (like neon), and each hydrogen atom a full duet of 2 electrons (like helium).\n*   **In water (H\u2082O):** An oxygen atom (6 valence electrons) shares one electron with each of two hydrogen atoms.

Therefore, all atoms in these molecules attain a stable, noble gas electronic configuration.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Calcium chloride is a covalent molecule.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082) is an ionic compound, not a covalent molecule. Bonding is determined by the types of elements involved. Calcium (Ca) is a Group 2 metal, and Chlorine (Cl) is a Group 17 non-metal. The bonding between a metal and a non-metal involves the transfer of electrons, which is characteristic of ionic bonding. A calcium atom loses its two valence electrons to form a positive ion (Ca\u00b2\u207a), and two chlorine atoms each gain one electron to form negative ions (Cl\u207b). The strong electrostatic force of attraction between these oppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons, typically between non-metal atoms.\n\n**C. Group I metals gain electrons when they bond with Group VII elements.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Group I metals (alkali metals) have one electron in their outermost shell. To achieve a stable noble gas configuration, they tend to *lose* this single valence electron, forming a positive ion (cation) with a charge of +1. Conversely, Group VII elements (halogens) have seven valence electrons and tend to *gain* one electron to complete their outer shell, forming a negative ion (anion) with a charge of -1. Therefore, in a reaction between a Group I metal and a Group VII element, the metal atom loses an electron, and the halogen atom gains an electron.\n\n**D. Oxide ions in calcium oxide are positively charged.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Calcium oxide (CaO) is an ionic compound formed from calcium (a Group 2 metal) and oxygen (a Group 16 non-metal). A calcium atom loses its two valence electrons to form a positively charged calcium ion (Ca\u00b2\u207a). An oxygen atom gains two electrons to complete its outer shell, forming a negatively charged oxide ion (O\u00b2\u207b). Ions that are formed by gaining electrons have more electrons than protons and are therefore negatively charged (anions). Ions that are positively charged are formed by losing electrons.

Increasing the pressure of a system containing gaseous reactants forces the gas particles closer together, which increases their concentration. According to collision theory, a higher concentration of reactant particles leads to a greater frequency of effective collisions per unit time. This results in an increased rate of reaction. Therefore, the reaction at a higher pressure (Line Y) will be faster than the original reaction (Line X).

Since the experiment is repeated using the same initial mass of the limiting reactant, the total amount (and therefore mass) of the product formed at the completion of the reaction will be the same in both cases. A change in pressure affects the *rate* at which the product is formed, but not the final *yield*.\n\nTherefore, the correct graph must show that Line Y has a steeper initial gradient than Line X (faster rate) and that both lines level off at the same final mass of product (same yield).

A double displacement reaction would occur: K\u2082SO\u2084(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) \u2192 Na\u2082SO\u2084(aq) + 2KOH(aq). Both the desired product, sodium sulfate (Na\u2082SO\u2084), and the other product, potassium hydroxide (KOH), are soluble in water. The resulting solution would be a mixture of four different ions (Na\u207a, K\u207a, SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, and OH\u207b), making it very difficult to isolate pure crystals of sodium sulfate from the mixture.\n\n**C. sodium nitrate and magnesium sulfate**\nMixing aqueous solutions of sodium nitrate (NaNO\u2083) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO\u2084) would result in a double displacement reaction: 2NaNO\u2083(aq) + MgSO\u2084(aq) \u2192 Na\u2082SO\u2084(aq) + Mg(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq).

As you move from one element to the next from left to right across any period, the atomic number increases by one each time. For example, in Period 3, the sequence is Sodium (Na, atomic number 11), Magnesium (Mg, 12), Aluminium (Al, 13), and so on. This is a fundamental principle of the Periodic Table's structure.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The metallic character of the elements decreases.** Metallic character refers to the set of chemical properties associated with metals, most notably the tendency to lose valence electrons to form positive ions. As you move across a period, the nuclear charge (number of protons) increases, but the number of electron shells remains the same. This leads to a stronger electrostatic attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative valence electrons, making it more difficult for an atom to lose electrons. Consequently, elements become less metallic and more non-metallic. For example, Period 3 begins with the highly metallic sodium (Na) and transitions through the metalloid silicon (Si) to the non-metals phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl).\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: 2 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it is incomplete.

This is because they have a complete, stable outer shell of electrons and thus have no tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons to form chemical bonds.

They are defined as elements that form at least one stable ion with a partially filled d-subshell. From the list of elements in the alloy (aluminium, copper, magnesium, manganese, silver, and zirconium), we can identify the transition elements:\n    *   **Copper (Cu)**, **Manganese (Mn)**, **Silver (Ag)**, and **Zirconium (Zr)** are all transition elements.\n    *   Aluminium (Al) is a Group 13 metal, and Magnesium (Mg) is a Group 2 metal. Neither are transition elements.\n    Therefore, there are **4** transition elements in the alloy.\n\n2.  **Relative Density:** Transition elements are known for having high densities. This is due to their atoms being packed closely together in a metallic lattice and having a relatively large atomic mass for their atomic size. In contrast, sodium (Na) is a Group 1 alkali metal, which are known for having very low densities. The density of sodium is approximately 0.97 g/cm\u00b3, whereas the densities of copper, manganese, silver, and zirconium are all significantly greater than this. Therefore, the relative density of the transition elements is **higher** than sodium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly identifies the number of transition elements as 4 but incorrectly describes their relative density. Transition elements are characteristically dense metals due to their atomic structure and packing. Sodium, an alkali metal, has a very low density. Thus, the density of the transition elements is higher, not lower, than that of sodium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the number of transition elements as 5. There are only 4 transition elements in the given list: copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), silver (Ag), and zirconium (Zr). Aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) are main group metals, not transition elements. While the statement about the relative density being 'higher' is correct, the initial count of transition elements is wrong, making the entire option incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. Firstly, it incorrectly states that there are 5 transition elements in the alloy, when there are only 4 (copper, manganese, silver, and zirconium). Secondly, it incorrectly states that the relative density of transition elements is lower than sodium. Transition elements are characteristically dense, while sodium is a low-density alkali metal.

The reactivity of the halogens decreases as you go down Group VII. This means that a more reactive halogen (higher up the group) will displace a less reactive halide ion (lower down the group) from its aqueous solution. Chlorine is in Period 3, while iodine is in Period 5. Therefore, chlorine is more reactive than iodine. When chlorine gas is bubbled through a colourless solution of sodium iodide, the chlorine atoms will oxidise the iodide ions to form iodine molecules, and the chlorine itself is reduced to chloride ions.

The elements get less dense going down Group VII.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Like most groups in the periodic table, the density of the halogens increases going down the group. As the atomic number increases, both the atomic mass and the atomic radius increase. The increase in mass is more significant than the increase in volume, leading to a higher density for elements further down the group.

However, the reactivity of halogens decreases down the group. Iodine is in Period 5 and is below bromine (Period 4) in Group VII. This means iodine is less reactive than bromine. A less reactive halogen cannot displace a more reactive halide from its salt solution.

They have a full outer shell of electrons, which makes them chemically stable and unreactive.\n\n1.  **Structure:** Because noble gases are already electronically stable, they do not need to form covalent bonds with other atoms to complete their outer shell. Consequently, they exist as individual, unbonded atoms. This structure is described as **monatomic**. This eliminates options describing the structure as diatomic.\n\n2.  **Boiling Point:** The only forces of attraction between the monatomic atoms of a noble gas are weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). Very little energy is required to overcome these weak forces. As a result, all noble gases have very **low boiling points**, meaning they are gases at room temperature (approximately 20\u00b0C). A boiling point of -107\u00b0C is a very low temperature, which is characteristic of a noble gas (specifically, it is close to the boiling point of xenon, -108.1\u00b0C).

Firstly, the boiling point of 107\u00b0C is too high for a noble gas, which has weak intermolecular forces and consequently a very low boiling point.

The formation of chlorine gas from hydrochloric acid typically requires a strong oxidizing agent and is not a product of a simple reaction between a metal and a dilute acid.\n\n**D) oxygen**\nOxygen gas (O\u2082) cannot be a product of this reaction because there are no oxygen atoms present in the reactants, magnesium (Mg) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Aluminium is a highly reactive metal, positioned near the top of the reactivity series, above carbon, zinc, and iron. Metals that are high in the reactivity series form very stable compounds (like aluminium oxide) and are consequently very difficult to extract from their ores. The extraction of aluminium requires a significant amount of energy through an industrial process called electrolysis. Conversely, metals near the bottom of the series, such as gold and silver, are unreactive and much easier to extract.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect. The extraction of a metal from its oxide by heating with carbon is a reduction reaction. This method is only effective if the metal is less reactive than carbon. Aluminium is more reactive than carbon. Therefore, carbon is not a strong enough reducing agent to displace aluminium from its stable oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083).

Pure water, at standard atmospheric pressure, has a distinct boiling point of exactly 100 \u00b0C. If a liquid boils at this precise temperature, it indicates two things: its identity as water and its purity. The presence of dissolved impurities (making it a mixture) would cause the boiling point to increase (a phenomenon known as boiling point elevation) and occur over a range of temperatures rather than at a single, fixed point. Therefore, boiling at 100 \u00b0C is the definitive test for the purity of water among the given options.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n*   **B. It has a pH value of 7:** While pure water is neutral and has a pH of 7 at 25 \u00b0C, this property is not exclusive to pure water. A solution of a neutral salt, such as sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved in water, would also have a pH of 7.

This effect occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat. These gases absorb long-wave infrared radiation that is re-emitted from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space and thus warming the lower atmosphere.\n\n1.  **Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082):** This is the most significant greenhouse gas contributing to global warming due to human activities. The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation have led to a substantial increase in its atmospheric concentration. Carbon dioxide molecules are very effective at absorbing infrared radiation.\n\n3.  **Methane (CH\u2084):** This is another potent greenhouse gas. Although present in lower concentrations than carbon dioxide, it is much more effective at trapping heat on a per-molecule basis. Major sources of increased methane include agriculture (livestock and rice cultivation), the extraction and use of fossil fuels, and the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.\n\nSince both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases that directly absorb infrared radiation, an increase in their concentrations leads directly to global warming.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: 1 and 4**\nWhile carbon dioxide (1) is a major greenhouse gas, sulfur dioxide (4) is not. Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is primarily known as a cause of acid rain. In the atmosphere, SO\u2082 can form sulfate aerosols. These tiny particles reflect incoming solar radiation back into space. This process has a net *cooling* effect on the Earth's climate, counteracting global warming to some extent. Therefore, an increase in sulfur dioxide does not lead to global warming.\n\n**C: 2 and 3**\nWhile methane (3) is a potent greenhouse gas, carbon monoxide (2) is not considered a *direct* greenhouse gas. Carbon monoxide (CO) does not absorb infrared radiation significantly. It contributes to global warming *indirectly* by reacting with hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) in the atmosphere, which would otherwise break down methane. This leads to an increase in the atmospheric lifetime and concentration of methane. However, the question asks for gases that lead *directly* to global warming.\n\n**D: 2 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because neither carbon monoxide (2) nor sulfur dioxide (4) directly causes global warming.

Propene (C\u2083H\u2086) is an alkene, which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond is a region of high electron density and can undergo addition reactions. When aqueous bromine (Br\u2082(aq)), which is reddish-brown, is added to propene, an electrophilic addition reaction occurs. The double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each of the carbon atoms, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH\u2082BrCHBrCH\u2083). This product is colourless. The consumption of the bromine in the reaction results in the decolourisation of the bromine water, which is a characteristic test for unsaturation.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Propene is obtained by cracking large alkanes.** This statement is correct. Cracking is an industrial process used to break down large, less useful long-chain hydrocarbon molecules (alkanes) from crude oil into smaller, more valuable hydrocarbons. This is achieved by heating the large alkanes to high temperatures (thermal cracking) or using a catalyst (catalytic cracking). The process results in a mixture of smaller alkanes and alkenes. Propene is one of the important alkenes produced through this method. For example, cracking decane (C\u2081\u2080H\u2082\u2082) can yield propene (C\u2083H\u2086) and heptane (C\u2087H\u2081\u2086).\n\n*   **Statement 4: Propene is a hydrocarbon.** This statement is correct. A hydrocarbon is defined as an organic compound that consists entirely of hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) atoms. The chemical formula for propene is C\u2083H\u2086.

Petroleum (crude oil) is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons with different chain lengths and, consequently, different boiling points. Fractional distillation separates this mixture by heating it, causing the hydrocarbons to vaporise. The vapour rises through a tall fractionating column that is hot at the bottom and cooler at the top. As the vapours rise and cool, different hydrocarbon fractions condense back into liquids at different levels according to their specific boiling points. Shorter-chain hydrocarbons with lower boiling points rise higher up the column before condensing, while longer-chain hydrocarbons with higher boiling points condense at lower, hotter levels. This allows for the collection of different useful fractions, such as petrol, kerosene, and diesel.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Chromatography**\nChromatography is a separation technique used to separate the components of a mixture based on their different affinities for a stationary phase and a mobile phase.

It involves breaking down large, less useful hydrocarbon molecules (often from the heavier fractions of crude oil) into smaller, more useful and valuable hydrocarbon molecules, such as petrol and alkenes. This is achieved using high temperatures and, often, a catalyst. Cracking changes the chemical structure of the molecules, whereas separation involves physically isolating existing components without chemical change.\n\n**C: Filtration**\nFiltration is a mechanical method used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid or gas by passing the mixture through a filter.

The chemical equation is:\nC\u2082H\u2084 (ethene) + H\u2082O (steam) \u2192 C\u2082H\u2085OH (ethanol)\n\nIn this process, the double bond (C=C) in the ethene molecule breaks, and a water molecule (H\u2082O) adds across it. One hydrogen atom from the water attaches to one carbon atom, and the hydroxyl group (-OH) attaches to the other carbon atom. This transforms the unsaturated ethene molecule into a saturated ethanol molecule. Since two reactant molecules combine to form a single product, this is classified as an addition reaction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: combustion\n\n**Combustion** is a high-temperature exothermic chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, to produce oxidised, often gaseous products, in a process that releases heat and light. For an organic compound like ethene or ethanol, complete combustion yields carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O). The given reaction, ethene + steam \u2192 ethanol, does not involve oxygen as a reactant and does not produce carbon dioxide and water as the primary products. Instead, it forms ethanol. Therefore, it is not a combustion reaction.\n\n#### C: fermentation\n\n**Fermentation** is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substrates through the action of enzymes produced by microorganisms like yeast. For the production of ethanol, fermentation typically involves the breakdown of glucose (a sugar) into ethanol and carbon dioxide in anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions. The equation for the fermentation of glucose is:\nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 \u2192 2C\u2082H\u2085OH + 2CO\u2082\nThe reaction shown in the question uses ethene and steam as reactants, not glucose, and does not involve microorganisms. Therefore, it is not fermentation.\n\n#### D: polymerisation\n\n**Polymerisation** is a process in which relatively small molecules, called monomers, combine chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecule, called a polymer. For example, ethene can undergo addition polymerisation, where many ethene monomers join together to form poly(ethene). This reaction would be represented as nC\u2082H\u2084 \u2192 (-CH\u2082-CH\u2082-)n. The reaction in the question involves one molecule of ethene reacting with one molecule of steam to form one molecule of ethanol, which is a small molecule, not a long polymer chain. Therefore, the reaction is not polymerisation."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_277.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "37 four statements about ethene or poly(ethene) are listed.\n1 poly(ethene) is produced by an addition reaction.\n2 ethene is a monomer.\n3  poly(ethene) is a monomer.\n4 poly(ethene) decolourises aqueous bromine.\nwhich statements are correct?\na i1and2 b 1and3 c 2and4 d 3and4", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nStatement 1 is correct. Poly(ethene) is formed through addition polymerisation. In this process, many ethene monomers, which are unsaturated molecules containing carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), add to one another. The double bond in each ethene molecule breaks, allowing a long saturated chain with only single carbon-carbon bonds (C-C) to form. This reaction is classified as an addition reaction because the monomers are joined together without the elimination of any other atoms or small molecules.\n\nStatement 2 is also correct. A monomer is a small, simple molecule that serves as the repeating structural unit to form a polymer. Ethene (C\u2082H\u2084) is the monomer that polymerises to form the long-chain polymer, poly(ethene).\n\nSince both statements 1 and 2 are correct, this option is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: 1 and 3**\nWhile statement 1 is correct, statement 3 is incorrect. Poly(ethene) is a polymer, which is a large macromolecule composed of many repeating monomer units. The monomer is the small building block, which in this case is ethene. Therefore, poly(ethene) is a polymer, not a monomer.\n\n**C: 2 and 4**\nWhile statement 2 is correct, statement 4 is incorrect. The decolourisation of aqueous bromine is a chemical test for unsaturation, specifically the presence of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. Ethene, the monomer, is unsaturated and will decolourise aqueous bromine. However, during polymerisation, the double bonds in the ethene monomers are broken to form the single bonds of the poly(ethene) chain. Consequently, poly(ethene) is a saturated molecule and lacks the C=C double bonds necessary to react with and decolourise aqueous bromine.\n\n**D: 3 and 4**\nBoth statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. Statement 3 is incorrect because poly(ethene) is a polymer, not a monomer. Statement 4 is incorrect because poly(ethene) is a saturated compound (containing only C-C single bonds) and therefore does not decolourise aqueous bromine, which is a test for unsaturated compounds (containing C=C or C\u2261C bonds)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_278.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "38 sea water contains dissolved sodium chloride.\nwhich method is used to obtain pure water from sea water?\na chromatography\nb distillation\nc_ evaporation\nd filtration", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B - distillation\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nDistillation is a separation technique used to separate a liquid solvent from a dissolved solute. The process relies on the difference in boiling points between the components of the mixture. Sea water is a solution where water is the solvent and sodium chloride (salt) is the solute. Water has a boiling point of 100\u00b0C, while sodium chloride has a much higher boiling point (1413\u00b0C). When sea water is heated to 100\u00b0C, the water boils and turns into steam (gaseous water), leaving the dissolved salt behind. This steam is then cooled in a condenser, causing it to change back into liquid form. The collected liquid is pure water, free from the dissolved salt.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A - chromatography:**\nChromatography is a technique used to separate a mixture of dissolved substances (solutes) from each other. It works by passing a solution (the mobile phase) through a medium (the stationary phase), and the different solutes travel at different speeds depending on their properties. This method is not suitable for separating a solvent (water) from a solute (salt) to obtain the pure solvent in large quantities.\n\n**C - evaporation:**\nEvaporation is the process used to separate a dissolved, non-volatile solid from a solvent. The solution is heated, causing the solvent to turn into a gas and escape into the surroundings, leaving the solid solute behind. While this method separates the salt from the water, the objective is to obtain *pure water*. In simple evaporation, the water is lost to the atmosphere and not collected.\n\n**D - filtration:**\nFiltration is a method used to separate an *insoluble* solid from a liquid. The mixture is passed through a filter paper which allows the liquid (filtrate) to pass through but traps the solid particles (residue). Since sodium chloride is *dissolved* in sea water, it forms a homogeneous solution, and its particles are too small to be separated by filtration. Both the water and the dissolved salt would pass through the filter."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_279.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "39 which piece of apparatus is used to measure exactly 21.4 cm? of water?\na a25cm\u2019 beaker\nb a25cm\u00b0 pipette\nc a50cm\u2019 burette\nd a50cm* measuring cylinder", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA **burette** is a piece of laboratory apparatus used to dispense variable, precise amounts of a liquid.

Copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) produce a blue-green colour in a flame test, not a lilac one. Furthermore, chloride ions (Cl\u207b) do not form a precipitate with barium nitrate. The test for chloride ions involves acidified silver nitrate, which would produce a white precipitate of silver chloride.\n\n**B. copper(II) sulfate**\nThis option is incorrect. While the sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) in copper(II) sulfate would produce a white precipitate with acidified barium nitrate, the cation is copper(II) (Cu\u00b2\u207a).

First, solid ice must be converted into liquid water. This process, where a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state, is called **melting**. Following this, the liquid water must be converted into gaseous steam. The process where a substance changes from a liquid to a gaseous state at its boiling point is called **boiling** (or vaporization). Therefore, both melting and boiling are required.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes freezing. **Freezing** is the process of a substance changing from a liquid to a solid state, which is the reverse of the first required step (melting). While **boiling** (liquid to gas) is the correct second step, freezing is the incorrect process for changing ice into liquid water.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes condensing. **Condensation** is the process of a substance changing from a gaseous to a liquid state, which is the reverse of the second required step (boiling).

These two processes describe the overall conversion of steam back into ice, not ice into steam.

When the temperature of a gas increases, its particles gain kinetic energy, move more rapidly, and collide more frequently and forcefully with the walls of their container. This causes the gas to expand, leading to an **increase in volume**.\n\n2.  **Effect of Pressure on Volume:** According to **Boyle's Law**, at constant temperature, the volume of a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (V \u221d 1/P). When the external pressure on a gas increases, the particles are forced closer together, reducing the space they occupy.

In this structure, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a rigid, tetrahedral arrangement. These covalent bonds are extremely strong and require a large amount of energy to break. This strong, interlocking, three-dimensional network makes diamond an exceptionally hard and durable material, giving it a very high melting point. Due to its extreme hardness, diamond is widely used in industrial applications for cutting, drilling, and grinding other hard materials.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. substance = diamond; It is an electrode because electrons can move.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while the substance is diamond, its properties are described inaccurately. For a substance to be used as an electrode, it must conduct electricity, which requires the presence of mobile, charge-carrying particles like delocalised electrons. In diamond, all four valence electrons of each carbon atom are used to form strong covalent bonds. These electrons are localised between the atoms and are not free to move throughout the structure. Consequently, diamond is an electrical insulator, not a conductor, and cannot be used as an electrode.\n\n**C. substance = graphite; It is used as an insulator because electrons cannot move.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the diagram shows the structure of diamond, not graphite. Graphite has a layered structure where each carbon atom is bonded to three others in hexagonal rings. Secondly, the description of graphite's electrical properties is false. Graphite is an electrical conductor because each carbon atom contributes one delocalised electron that is free to move between the layers, allowing it to conduct electricity. Therefore, graphite is used for electrodes, not as an insulator.\n\n**D. substance = graphite; It is a lubricant because atoms can slide over each other.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the substance shown. The diagram displays the rigid lattice of diamond, not the layered structure of graphite. While it is true that graphite is used as a lubricant, this property is a result of its unique structure. In graphite, the layers of carbon atoms are held together by weak intermolecular forces, which allow the layers to easily slide over one another.

A molecular formula does not show this structural information.\n\n**C. the number and arrangement of different atoms in one gram of a compound**\nThis statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, a molecular formula describes the composition of a single molecule, a microscopic particle, not a macroscopic quantity like one gram.

This is a significant improvement over the dull, grey appearance of iron, making the taps more decorative and visually appealing in kitchens and bathrooms.\n\n2.  **Preventing Corrosion (Statement 3):** Iron readily corrodes (rusts) in the presence of water and oxygen, which are constantly present in the environment of a water tap. Chromium is a highly corrosion-resistant metal because it forms a very thin, hard, and non-porous layer of chromium(III) oxide on its surface.

To achieve the fastest possible reaction rate, the conditions that maximize the frequency and energy of collisions between reactant particles must be chosen.\n\n*   **Temperature:** A higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of the reactant particles. This leads to more frequent collisions and, more importantly, a higher proportion of collisions having sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. At 40 \u00b0C, the particles have more kinetic energy than at 30 \u00b0C.\n*   **Concentration:** A higher concentration of hydrochloric acid (2.0 mol/dm\u00b3) means there are more HCl particles per unit volume compared to a lower concentration (1.0 mol/dm\u00b3). This increases the frequency of collisions between the HCl and magnesium particles.\n*   **Surface Area:** Using magnesium in a powdered form provides a significantly larger surface area compared to a ribbon of the same mass. A larger surface area exposes more magnesium atoms to the hydrochloric acid, increasing the frequency of effective collisions.\n\nRow B combines the highest temperature (40 \u00b0C), the highest HCl concentration (2.0 mol/dm\u00b3), and the largest surface area (powder). This combination of conditions ensures the highest frequency of energetic collisions, resulting in the fastest rate of reaction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A\nThis option will not produce the fastest reaction rate because both the temperature (30 \u00b0C) and the concentration of HCl (1.0 mol/dm\u00b3) are lower than the maximum values available in the options. A lower temperature means reactant particles have less kinetic energy, and a lower concentration means there are fewer reactant particles in the same volume. Both factors lead to a lower frequency of effective collisions compared to the conditions in row B, resulting in a slower reaction.\n\n#### C\nThis option represents the conditions that would lead to the slowest rate of reaction. It combines the lowest temperature (30 \u00b0C), the lowest concentration of HCl (1.0 mol/dm\u00b3), and the smallest surface area (magnesium ribbon). Each of these factors individually slows down the reaction rate by reducing the frequency and energy of collisions between reactant particles. Therefore, their combined effect results in a significantly slower reaction compared to the conditions in row B.\n\n#### D\nWhile this option uses the highest temperature (40 \u00b0C) and the highest concentration of HCl (2.0 mol/dm\u00b3), it uses magnesium in the form of a ribbon. A ribbon has a much smaller surface area than a powder. The smaller surface area limits the number of magnesium atoms exposed for reaction at any given time, reducing the frequency of collisions between the reactants.

It is a spectator ion, meaning it does not participate directly in the neutralization reaction. It remains in the solution unchanged and does not contribute to the acidity or alkalinity of the mixture. Therefore, it does not cause the resulting mixture to be acidic.\n\n**C: OH\u207b**\nThe hydroxide ion (OH\u207b) is responsible for making solutions alkaline (basic). In this reaction, sodium hydroxide is the limiting reactant, meaning it is completely used up. All the OH\u207b ions react with the H\u207a ions from the excess acid to form water. Since there are no significant amounts of OH\u207b ions left in the final mixture, they cannot be the cause of the solution's properties.

The question requires the reaction of two *aqueous* salts. Barium sulfate (BaSO\u2084) is an insoluble salt, meaning it cannot be one of the starting aqueous reactants.\n\n**Option D (2 and 4):** Neither reaction described in these rows meets the initial conditions of the question.

However, when exposed to air, it rapidly forms a thin, tough, and unreactive layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface. This process is called passivation. The oxide layer is non-porous and adheres strongly to the metal, protecting the aluminium underneath from further reaction or corrosion. This property makes aluminium an excellent material for food and drink containers, as it will not react with the contents and contaminate them.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Aluminium has a high strength and high density so is used to make aircraft.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies a key property of aluminium. While aluminium alloys do have high strength, aluminium itself is notable for its **low density**. It is this combination of high strength (when alloyed) and low density (low mass per unit volume) that makes it ideal for aircraft construction, as it reduces the overall weight of the aircraft, improving fuel efficiency and performance.\n\n**B. Copper has a low melting point so is used in electrical wiring.**\nThis statement incorrectly links the use of copper to its melting point. Copper is used for electrical wiring primarily because it is an excellent electrical conductor and is highly ductile, meaning it can be easily drawn into thin wires. Its melting point (1085 \u00b0C) is relatively high, not low. A high melting point is a desirable property for electrical wiring, as it helps prevent the wire from melting if it overheats due to high electrical current.\n\n**D.

Stainless steel is an alloy containing chromium. The chromium reacts with oxygen in the air to form a very thin, passive, and non-reactive layer of chromium(III) oxide on the surface. This layer protects the iron in the steel from reacting with oxygen and water, thus preventing the formation of rust (hydrated iron(III) oxide).\n2.  **Hardness:** Cutlery must be durable enough to withstand daily use without bending, deforming, or scratching easily. Knives, in particular, need to be hard to maintain a sharp cutting edge. Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. The presence of carbon atoms, which are of a different size to the iron atoms, disrupts the regular arrangement of the metal lattice. This makes it more difficult for the layers of atoms to slide over one another, resulting in a material that is significantly harder and stronger than pure iron.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect because stainless steel is not a pure metal; it is an alloy.

Stainless steel is an alloy, not a pure metal. An alloy is a mixture of a metal with at least one other element.

Its useful properties, such as hardness and rust resistance, are a direct result of it being an alloy, not a pure element.\n\n*   **Option C (1 and 3 only):** This option is incorrect for two reasons.

This reaction produces hydrogen gas, and the rate of this gas production is observed as the rate of effervescence (fizzing). A more reactive metal will react more vigorously and produce gas at a higher rate.\n\nBy analysing the rates of effervescence provided in the table, we can establish the reactivity series for these four metals:\n*   **Calcium** shows a \"very high\" rate of effervescence, indicating it is the most reactive metal in this group.\n*   **Magnesium** shows a \"high\" rate of effervescence. This is less vigorous than calcium's reaction, so magnesium is the second most reactive.\n*   **Iron** shows a \"low\" rate of effervescence, indicating it is less reactive than both calcium and magnesium.\n*   **Copper** shows \"none,\" meaning it does not react with the dilute hydrochloric acid. This makes it the least reactive metal in the group.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of reactivity, starting with the most reactive, is: **Calcium \u2192 Magnesium \u2192 Iron \u2192 Copper**.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: iron \u2192 magnesium \u2192 calcium \u2192 copper**\nThis order is incorrect because it identifies iron as the most reactive metal.

Firstly, it suggests that magnesium is more reactive than calcium.

This method works by creating a physical, impermeable layer on the surface of the iron. This layer prevents two essential substances required for rusting\u2014oxygen (from the air) and water (or moisture)\u2014from coming into contact with the iron. Since the electrochemical reactions that cause rusting cannot occur without both oxygen and water, the plastic coating effectively prevents the iron from rusting. This is a common and effective method used for items like wire fences, tools, and metal furniture.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The rusting of iron forms hydrated iron(II) oxide.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Rusting is an oxidation process where iron reacts with oxygen and water. The final product of rusting is **hydrated iron(III) oxide**, which has the general chemical formula Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O. The Roman numeral (III) indicates that the iron ions in the compound have an oxidation state of +3. While iron(II) ions (Fe\u00b2\u207a) are formed as an intermediate step in the rusting process, they are quickly oxidized further to iron(III) ions (Fe\u00b3\u207a) before forming the final rust product.\n\n**B. Barrier methods prevent rusting by excluding nitrogen and water.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies one of the key reactants for rusting. The two substances required for iron to rust are **oxygen and water**. Nitrogen, although the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, is relatively unreactive and does not participate in the rusting process. Barrier methods work by creating a physical shield that excludes oxygen and water from the iron's surface, not nitrogen and water.\n\n**C.

Water, unless it has been boiled to remove dissolved gases and then sealed from the air, contains dissolved oxygen. Therefore, a piece of iron completely submerged in a typical sample of water (e.g., tap water in an open container) will have access to both water and dissolved oxygen, and it will rust.

Activated carbon has a highly porous structure, which provides an exceptionally large surface area. This large surface area allows it to effectively adsorb a wide range of organic compounds and other chemicals responsible for unpleasant tastes and odours. Adsorption is a process where these impurity molecules stick to the surface of the carbon, thereby removing them from the water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Filtration is used to remove soluble substances.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Filtration is a physical separation technique used to remove **insoluble** solids from a liquid. The process involves passing the water through a filter medium, such as a bed of sand and gravel. The pores in the filter are small enough to trap solid particles like silt, clay, and organic debris, but they are too large to capture dissolved (soluble) substances, which pass through with the water molecules.\n\n**C. Chlorination is used to remove unpleasant tastes.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The primary purpose of chlorination is **disinfection**. Chlorine is a powerful oxidising agent that is added to water to kill pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, making the water safe for consumption. While it is essential for public health, chlorination does not remove existing unpleasant tastes; in fact, it can sometimes impart its own distinct taste and odour to the water. The removal of tastes and odours is typically achieved by treatment with activated carbon.\n\n**D. Sedimentation is used to kill microbes.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Sedimentation is a physical process used to remove large, **suspended solids** from water. During sedimentation, water is held in a large tank, allowing heavier particles like sand and silt to settle to the bottom due to gravity. This process clarifies the water by removing solid matter but does not kill microorganisms. The killing of microbes (disinfection) is a chemical process carried out in a later stage, most commonly through chlorination."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_311.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "31. a farmer knows his soil needs phosphorus and potassium.\n\nhe has a choice of four fertilisers.\n1 nh,no,\n2 (nh,)3po,\n3 kno,\n4 (nh,),co\n\nwhich fertilisers should he use?\n\na 1and2 b 1and4 c 2and3 d 3and4", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C: 2 and 3**\n\nThis option is correct because the combination of fertilisers 2 and 3 provides both of the essential nutrients the farmer's soil needs: phosphorus and potassium.\n\n*   **Fertiliser 2 is (NH\u2084)\u2083PO\u2084, ammonium phosphate.** The presence of the phosphate ion (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) means this compound is a source of **phosphorus (P)**.\n*   **Fertiliser 3 is KNO\u2083, potassium nitrate.** The presence of the potassium ion (K\u207a) means this compound is a source of **potassium (K)**.\n\nBy using both fertilisers, the farmer can add both phosphorus and potassium to the soil.

These gases react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Therefore, effective strategies to reduce acid rain must focus on decreasing the emission of these specific precursor gases.\n\n- **Strategy 2 (Using catalytic converters in motor vehicles):** This is a correct and effective strategy. The high temperatures in internal combustion engines cause nitrogen and oxygen from the air to react, producing oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Catalytic converters contain catalysts, such as platinum and rhodium, which convert these harmful oxides of nitrogen back into harmless nitrogen gas (N\u2082) before they are released into the atmosphere. This directly reduces a major source of the pollutants that form nitric acid.\n\n- **Strategy 4 (Using low-sulfur fuels):** This is also a correct and effective strategy. Many fossil fuels, particularly coal and some forms of petroleum, contain sulfur as an impurity. When these fuels are burned, the sulfur is oxidized to form sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082). By using fuels with a lower sulfur content or by removing sulfur from fuels before combustion (a process known as desulfurization), the amount of SO\u2082 released into the atmosphere is significantly reduced. This directly decreases the formation of sulfuric acid, a key component of acid rain.\n\nSince both strategies 2 and 4 directly reduce the production of the primary gases responsible for acid rain, this option is correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) 1 and 3:** This option is incorrect.\n- **Strategy 1 (Planting trees):** While beneficial for the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas), planting trees does not reduce the atmospheric concentration of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen, which are the main causes of acid rain.\n- **Strategy 3 (Reducing livestock farming):** Livestock farming is a major source of methane (a greenhouse gas) and ammonia. While ammonia plays a role in atmospheric chemistry, it is a base, not an acid, and reducing it does not address the root cause of acid rain, which is the emission of acidic gases like SO\u2082 and NOx.\n\n**B) 1 and 4:** This option is incorrect because, although using low-sulfur fuels (Strategy 4) is an effective measure, planting trees (Strategy 1) does not target the specific pollutants (SO\u2082 and NOx) that cause acid rain. It is primarily a strategy to combat the greenhouse effect.\n\n**C) 2 and 3:** This option is incorrect because, while using catalytic converters (Strategy 2) is an effective measure, reducing livestock farming (Strategy 3) does not reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen, the primary precursors of acid rain.

Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula **C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082**. For C\u2082H\u2086, n=2. Applying the alkane formula gives C\u2082H\u2082(\u2082)\u208a\u2082 = C\u2082H\u2086. This matches the formula for ethane, which is an alkane and contains only single carbon-carbon bonds.

Alkenes undergo a rapid electrophilic addition reaction with aqueous bromine (Br\u2082(aq)). In this reaction, the double bond in the hexene molecule breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each of the carbon atoms that were part of the double bond. The product, 1,2-dibromohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082Br\u2082), is colourless. Since the orange-coloured aqueous bromine is consumed in the reaction, the solution is decolourised, changing from orange to colourless.

To achieve a stable electronic configuration with a full outer shell of eight electrons (an octet), each fluorine atom needs to gain one more electron.\n\nIn a fluorine molecule (F\u2082), two fluorine atoms bond covalently. Each atom contributes one electron to form a single shared pair of electrons. This single covalent bond holds the two atoms together. The remaining six valence electrons on each atom are not involved in bonding and exist as three lone pairs (non-bonding pairs).\n\nThis arrangement allows each fluorine atom to have a stable octet in its outer shell: six of its own non-bonding electrons plus the two shared electrons from the covalent bond. Diagram B correctly illustrates this, showing one shared pair between the atoms and six non-bonding electrons on each atom.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** This diagram is incorrect because it depicts a triple covalent bond between the two fluorine atoms, with three shared pairs of electrons.

It consists of layers of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal rings. Within each layer, the carbon atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds. However, the forces between these layers are weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). These weak forces allow the layers to easily slide over one another. When used as a lubricant, these layers shear off and coat the moving parts, reducing friction between them.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. cutting tools**\nCutting tools require a material that is exceptionally hard and resistant to wear. This property is characteristic of diamond, another allotrope of carbon, not graphite. In diamond, each carbon atom is strongly bonded to four others in a rigid, three-dimensional tetrahedral lattice. This structure makes diamond the hardest known natural substance. In contrast, graphite is soft because its layers can slide, making it completely unsuitable for use in cutting tools.\n\n**B. electrodes**\nThe use of graphite as an electrode, for example in electrolysis or electric arc furnaces, depends on its ability to conduct electricity and its high melting point. The electrical conductivity arises from delocalised electrons between the layers of carbon atoms, which are free to move and carry an electric current. Its high melting point is due to the strong covalent bonds within the layers that require a large amount of energy to break. While its layered structure is responsible for this property, the specific function as an electrode relies on electrical conductivity, not the ability of the layers to slide.\n\n**C. jewellery**\nMaterials used for jewellery are typically chosen for their hardness, durability, and aesthetic qualities such as lustre and brilliance. Diamond is a popular choice for jewellery due to its extreme hardness and high refractive index, which gives it sparkle. Graphite is a dull, black, and soft solid, which lacks the physical properties desired for making jewellery.

The vertical axis represents potential energy (enthalpy). In this diagram, the energy level of the products is higher than the energy level of the reactants. This indicates that there has been a net absorption of energy from the surroundings for the reaction to occur. A reaction that absorbs energy from the surroundings is defined as an **endothermic** reaction. Therefore, statement 2, \"The reaction is endothermic,\" is correct. Statement 1, which claims the reaction is exothermic, is incorrect as that would require the products to have lower energy than the reactants.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Effect on Surroundings:**\n    Because the reaction is endothermic, it takes in heat energy from its surroundings. This transfer of energy from the surroundings into the chemical system causes the temperature of the surroundings to fall. Therefore, statement 4, \"The temperature of the surroundings decreases,\" is correct. Statement 3, which claims the temperature of the surroundings increases, would be true for an exothermic reaction, where heat is released into the surroundings.\n\nSince statements 2 and 4 are both correct descriptions of the process shown in the diagram, option D is the correct answer.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Option A (1 and 3):** This option is incorrect because it describes an exothermic reaction. Statement 1 is false; the diagram shows an endothermic process (products have higher energy). Statement 3 is also false; an endothermic reaction causes the temperature of the surroundings to decrease, not increase.\n\n*   **Option B (1 and 4):** This option is incorrect because the statements are contradictory. Statement 1 claims the reaction is exothermic (releases heat), while statement 4 claims the temperature of the surroundings decreases (which happens when heat is absorbed). The diagram shows an endothermic reaction, making statement 1 false.\n\n*   **Option C (2 and 3):** This option is incorrect because the statements are contradictory. While statement 2 correctly identifies the reaction as endothermic, statement 3 incorrectly claims the temperature of the surroundings increases. An endothermic reaction absorbs heat, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_332.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "12 which process involves a chemical change?\na adding sodium to water\nb _ boiling water\nc_ dissolving sodium chloride in water\nd producing water from aqueous sodium chloride", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA chemical change results in the formation of one or more new chemical substances with different properties and compositions from the original substances. When solid sodium (Na) is added to water (H\u2082O), a vigorous chemical reaction occurs. The sodium reacts with the water to produce two new substances: aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H\u2082). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n2Na(s) + 2H\u2082O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + H\u2082(g)\nSince new chemical substances are formed, this process is a chemical change.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. boiling water**\nBoiling is a change of state from liquid to gas. This is a physical change, not a chemical one. During boiling, liquid water (H\u2082O) becomes water vapour (H\u2082O). The chemical composition of the water molecules remains the same; they are simply further apart and have more kinetic energy. No new substances are formed.\n\n**C. dissolving sodium chloride in water**\nDissolving is a physical process where a solute (sodium chloride) disperses into a solvent (water) to form a mixture called a solution. While sodium chloride (NaCl) dissociates into its ions (Na\u207a and Cl\u207b) in water, no new chemical substances are created. The original salt and water can be recovered by a physical process, such as evaporating the water. Therefore, this is a physical change.\n\n**D. producing water from aqueous sodium chloride**\nThis describes a physical separation process, such as distillation or evaporation. These techniques are used to separate the components of a mixture based on their different physical properties (e.g., boiling points). In this case, water is separated from the dissolved sodium chloride. No chemical reaction takes place, and no new substances are formed.

The rate of decrease, indicated by the steepness (gradient) of the curve, is fastest at the beginning and slows down over time. This pattern is characteristic of the concentration of a reactant. In the reaction Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 ZnCl\u2082(aq) + H\u2082(g), hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a reactant. Its concentration is highest at the start and is consumed as the reaction progresses, causing its concentration to fall. The reaction slows down as the HCl concentration drops, which is consistent with the curve becoming less steep and eventually flattening out as the HCl is used up.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: amount of ZnCl\u2082 produced**\nZinc chloride (ZnCl\u2082) is a product of the reaction. At the beginning of the reaction (time = 0), no product has been formed, so its amount would be zero. As the reaction proceeds, the amount of ZnCl\u2082 increases. A graph of the amount of a product versus time would start at the origin (0,0) and curve upwards, which is the opposite of the graph shown.\n\n**C: mass of Zn reacted**\nThis option refers to the cumulative mass of zinc that has been consumed during the reaction. At time = 0, no zinc has reacted, so this value would be zero. As the reaction progresses, more zinc is consumed, and the \"mass of Zn reacted\" increases over time. Therefore, a graph of the mass of zinc reacted versus time would start at the origin and curve upwards, which is the opposite of the graph shown. Note that if the axis represented the \"mass of Zn *remaining*\", it would show a decreasing curve, but this is not the option provided.\n\n**D: volume of H\u2082 produced**\nHydrogen gas (H\u2082) is a product of the reaction. Similar to the other product, ZnCl\u2082, the volume of H\u2082 produced starts at zero at time = 0. As the reaction continues, hydrogen gas is generated, and its total volume increases.

In the reaction **CuO + C \u2192 Cu + CO**, copper(II) oxide (CuO) loses its oxygen atom to become elemental copper (Cu). This loss of oxygen signifies that the copper in copper(II) oxide has been reduced.\n\nAlternatively, considering oxidation states, the copper in CuO has an oxidation state of +2 (since oxygen is -2). In the product, elemental copper (Cu) has an oxidation state of 0. The oxidation state of copper has decreased from +2 to 0, which confirms that reduction has occurred. Carbon acts as the reducing agent, as it is oxidized from an oxidation state of 0 in C to +2 in CO.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:**\nIn this reaction, **2CuS + 3O\u2082 \u2192 2CuO + 2SO\u2082**, the copper-containing reactant is copper(II) sulfide (CuS), and the copper-containing product is copper(II) oxide (CuO). To determine if copper is reduced, we examine its oxidation state. In CuS, the sulfide ion (S\u00b2\u207b) has a charge of -2, so the copper ion (Cu\u00b2\u207a) has an oxidation state of +2. In CuO, the oxide ion (O\u00b2\u207b) has a charge of -2, so the copper ion (Cu\u00b2\u207a) also has an oxidation state of +2. Since the oxidation state of copper does not change, it is neither oxidized nor reduced.\n\n**C:**\nThe equation **Cu(g) \u2192 Cu(l)** represents a physical change of state, specifically condensation, where gaseous copper cools to form liquid copper. Reduction is a chemical change involving the transfer of electrons and a change in oxidation state. In this process, the substance is elemental copper on both sides of the equation, and its oxidation state remains 0. No chemical reaction has occurred, and therefore, no reduction has taken place.\n\n**D:**\nThe equation **Cu(l) \u2192 Cu(s)** represents a physical change of state, specifically freezing or solidification, where liquid copper cools to form solid copper. This is a physical process, not a chemical reaction. The oxidation state of elemental copper is 0 in both the liquid and solid states.

Ammonium nitrate (NH\u2084NO\u2083) is an ammonium salt. Ammonia (NH\u2083), a weak base, is liberated from its salts by reacting them with a stronger base, not an acid. For example, warming ammonium nitrate with sodium hydroxide (a strong base) would produce ammonia gas: NH\u2084NO\u2083(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaNO\u2083(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + NH\u2083(g).

The copper(II) sulfate solution passes through the filter paper as the filtrate, while the unreacted copper(II) carbonate is left behind as the residue.\n\n2.  **Crystallisation (1):** After filtration, a pure solution of copper(II) sulfate is obtained.

Titration is a quantitative method used to determine the precise volume of a solution required to react completely with another solution, typically in acid-alkali neutralisation where both reactants are soluble.

Halogens are non-metals found in Group 17 of the Periodic Table. Their atoms have seven valence electrons and require one more electron to achieve a stable, full outer shell (an octet). To achieve this stability, two halogen atoms each share one electron with the other, forming a single covalent bond.

The reactivity of halogens decreases as you go down the group. Reactivity in halogens is defined by their ability to gain an electron to form a negative ion (halide). As you descend the group, the atomic radius increases, and the outermost electron shell becomes further from the positive attraction of the nucleus.

Therefore, chlorine, being higher up the group, is more reactive than iodine.\n*   **Statement 3: They are all gases at room temperature.** This statement is incorrect. The physical state of the halogens at room temperature changes down the group. As the size of the molecules increases from chlorine to iodine, the number of electrons also increases.

Only a small amount of energy is needed to overcome these forces and change the state from solid to liquid.\n2.  **Conductivity:** The substance is a poor conductor of electricity in both solid and molten states because it lacks mobile charge carriers. In simple molecular substances, electrons are held tightly within covalent bonds or as lone pairs on atoms and are not free to move. There are no free ions present in either the solid or liquid state.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Incorrect**\nThis substance has a low melting point (63 \u00b0C) and is a good electrical conductor in both the solid and molten states. Good conductivity in both states is a hallmark property of metals, which have a 'sea' of delocalised electrons that are free to move and carry charge. The low melting point is characteristic of some reactive metals, such as the alkali metals (e.g., potassium melts at 63.5 \u00b0C). This describes a metallic element, not a non-metallic one.\n\n**C. Incorrect**\nThis substance has a high melting point (659 \u00b0C) and is a good conductor in both solid and molten states. Like substance A, the good conductivity in both phases is due to delocalised electrons, identifying it as a metal. The high melting point indicates strong metallic bonding, which is typical for many metals (e.g., magnesium melts at 650 \u00b0C). This describes a metallic element.\n\n**D. Incorrect**\nThis substance has a high melting point (808 \u00b0C), is a poor conductor when solid, but becomes a good conductor when molten. These are the classic properties of a giant ionic compound (e.g., sodium chloride melts at 801 \u00b0C). In the solid state, the ions are held in fixed positions within a rigid lattice and cannot move to carry a current.

Aqueous solutions of all halide ions (e.g., chloride Cl\u207b, bromide Br\u207b, iodide I\u207b) are colourless.\n\nCombining these two points, X\u2082 can be chlorine, and the Y\u207b ion is colourless. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: X\u2082 = chlorine, Y\u207b = brown**\nWhile it is correct that X\u2082 could be chlorine, the statement that the Y\u207b ion is brown is incorrect. All halide ions are colourless in aqueous solution. The product of the reaction, Y\u2082 (which would be Br\u2082 or I\u2082), would form a brown or orange-brown solution, but the reactant ion, Y\u207b, is colourless.\n\n**C: X\u2082 = iodine, Y\u207b = brown**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, if X\u2082 is iodine (I\u2082), it is the least reactive of the common halogens. It cannot displace other halide ions such as chloride (Cl\u207b) or bromide (Br\u207b). Therefore, the reaction would not proceed as written. Secondly, as explained above, the halide ion Y\u207b would be colourless, not brown.\n\n**D: X\u2082 = iodine, Y\u207b = colourless**\nWhile this option correctly identifies the colour of the Y\u207b ion as colourless, it incorrectly identifies X\u2082 as iodine.

For rusting to occur, two substances must be present: oxygen and water. In the initial setup, the air inside the container provides the necessary oxygen, and water is present as water vapour in the air.\n\nArgon is a noble gas, meaning it is chemically inert or unreactive. By replacing the air in the container with argon, the oxygen is removed from the environment surrounding the iron nails. Since oxygen is one of the essential reactants for the rusting process, its absence will prevent the chemical reaction from occurring. Therefore, the iron nails will not rust.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A) Leave the lid off.**\n\nLeaving the lid off would expose the iron nails to the surrounding atmosphere. The atmosphere provides a continuous and unlimited supply of both oxygen and water vapour. This would not prevent rusting; instead, it would likely accelerate the rate of rusting compared to the sealed container, as the reactants (oxygen and water) are constantly replenished.\n\n**C) Put the container in a warm place.**\n\nRusting is a chemical reaction. The rate of most chemical reactions, including rusting, increases with an increase in temperature. The additional thermal energy increases the kinetic energy of the reactant particles, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions. Therefore, placing the container in a warm place would cause the nails to rust faster, not prevent it.\n\n**D) Seal the container in a bag.**\n\nThe problem states that the container is already airtight. This means that the conditions inside the container are isolated from the outside. Placing this already-sealed container inside another sealed container, such as a bag, does not change the environment *inside* the original container. The oxygen and water vapour initially trapped inside with the nails will still be present, and rusting will proceed.

A pure substance will have a sharp, fixed boiling point at a specific atmospheric pressure. Pure water boils at exactly 100\u00b0C at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). The presence of any dissolved impurities, whether solid, liquid, or gas, will disrupt the arrangement of water molecules and alter the energy required for the phase change. This causes the boiling point to either increase (in the case of non-volatile solutes like salt) or to occur over a range of temperatures rather than at a single, fixed point. Therefore, observing a sharp boiling point at 100\u00b0C is a reliable method for confirming the purity of a water sample.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Evaporate the water to see if any solids remain.**\nThis test is used to determine the presence of dissolved, non-volatile solids. While finding a solid residue after evaporation would prove the water is impure, the absence of a residue does not confirm purity. The water sample could still contain dissolved volatile impurities (such as ethanol) or dissolved gases, which would evaporate along with the water, leaving no solid behind. Thus, this test is incomplete for determining overall purity.\n\n**C. Test with anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride.**\nAnhydrous cobalt(II) chloride paper or powder is used as a chemical test for the *presence* of water. In its anhydrous (water-free) state, it is blue.

Fractional distillation is a process used to separate components of a liquid mixture based on differences in their boiling points. To separate the gases in air, the air must first be cooled to a very low temperature (around -200\u00b0C) to turn it into a liquid.\n\nIn the fractionating column, the liquid air is slowly warmed. Nitrogen has a lower boiling point (-196\u00b0C) than oxygen (-183\u00b0C). Consequently, the liquid nitrogen boils first, turning into a gas. This nitrogen gas rises to the top of the column, where it is piped off and collected. The liquid oxygen, with its higher boiling point, remains at the bottom of the column and is collected as a liquid. As nitrogen and oxygen are the most abundant gases in the air, they are considered the main products of this process.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. carbon dioxide and oxygen**\nWhile oxygen is a major product of the fractional distillation of liquid air, carbon dioxide is not. Before air is liquefied, it is purified to remove substances that would solidify at low temperatures and block the equipment. Carbon dioxide has a sublimation point of -78.5\u00b0C, meaning it would turn into a solid (dry ice) long before the air liquefies. Therefore, carbon dioxide is removed from the air prior to the fractional distillation process.\n\n**B. carbon dioxide and water vapour**\nNeither carbon dioxide nor water vapour are products of the fractional distillation of liquid air. Both substances are removed from the air before it is liquefied. Water vapour is filtered out because it would freeze into ice at 0\u00b0C, and carbon dioxide is removed because it would solidify at -78.5\u00b0C. These solid materials would block the pipes and machinery of the liquefaction plant. Since they are removed beforehand, they are not present in the liquid air being distilled.\n\n**D. nitrogen and water vapour**\nAlthough nitrogen is a main product, water vapour is not. The air is first filtered and dried to remove water vapour before the liquefaction process begins. This is a crucial step because if water vapour were present, it would freeze to form ice at 0\u00b0C, which is a much higher temperature than that required to liquefy air (around -200\u00b0C). The ice would cause blockages in the apparatus.

It consists of hydrocarbons typically containing 5 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. This fraction is highly volatile and has a low boiling point, which allows it to vaporise and combust easily in the internal combustion engines used in most cars. Therefore, its primary use is as fuel for cars.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** Bitumen is the residue left at the bottom of the fractionating column after all other fractions have been distilled off. It is a thick, black, viscous material with a very high boiling point and consists of large hydrocarbon molecules (typically more than 70 carbon atoms). Due to its properties, it is used for surfacing roads and for waterproofing roofs, not as a fuel for ships. The fraction used as fuel for ships is fuel oil.\n\n**B:** Refinery gas is the fraction with the lowest boiling point, collected at the very top of the fractionating column. It consists of very small hydrocarbon molecules (1 to 4 carbon atoms). It is commonly used as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for domestic heating and cooking. Jet fuel is primarily composed of the kerosene fraction, which contains hydrocarbons with 11 to 16 carbon atoms and has a higher boiling point than refinery gas.\n\n**C:** Fuel oil is a relatively heavy fraction with large molecules and a high boiling point. It is used as a fuel for large engines, such as those in ships, and in industrial furnaces and power stations. The material used for road making is bitumen, which is the thick, viscous residue from the fractional distillation process."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_354.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "34 which statement about alkanes is correct?\na they are saturated.\nb_ they are very reactive.\nc_ they contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen only.\nd_ they contain double bonds.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for option A (Correct)\n\nAlkanes are classified as saturated hydrocarbons. A saturated compound is one that contains only single covalent bonds between its carbon atoms. This means that each carbon atom is bonded to the maximum possible number of other atoms (either carbon or hydrogen). The general formula for alkanes, C_n H_(2n+2), reflects this saturation. Due to the presence of only strong, stable C-C and C-H single bonds, no further atoms can be added to the carbon chain without first breaking existing bonds.\n\n### Explanation for option B (Incorrect)\n\nAlkanes are generally unreactive compared to other homologous series like alkenes. Their lack of reactivity stems from the strength and non-polar nature of the C-C and C-H single covalent bonds. These bonds require a significant amount of energy to break. While alkanes do undergo important reactions, such as combustion and substitution reactions with halogens in the presence of ultraviolet light, they do not readily undergo the addition reactions characteristic of more reactive, unsaturated compounds. Therefore, the statement that they are \"very reactive\" is incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for option C (Incorrect)\n\nAlkanes are hydrocarbons. By definition, hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist entirely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The presence of oxygen would place the compound into a different homologous series, such as alcohols (containing an -OH group) or carboxylic acids (containing a -COOH group). Therefore, the statement that alkanes contain oxygen is incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for option D (Incorrect)\n\nThe defining feature of the alkane homologous series is the presence of only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms (C-C). Hydrocarbons that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are known as alkenes, while those with carbon-carbon triple bonds (C\u2261C) are alkynes. Both alkenes and alkynes are examples of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Since alkanes are saturated, they do not contain any carbon-carbon double or triple bonds."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_355.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "35 what is the approximate volume of nitrogen in 200 cm? of air?\na 20cm? b 40cm c 80cm d 160cm*", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nAir is a mixture of gases, with its primary component being nitrogen. For calculations, dry air is approximated to be composed of about 80% (or 4/5) nitrogen and 20% (or 1/5) oxygen. To find the approximate volume of nitrogen in a 200 cm\u00b3 sample of air, we calculate 80% of the total volume.\n\nVolume of Nitrogen = 80% of 200 cm\u00b3\nVolume of Nitrogen = (80 / 100) \u00d7 200 cm\u00b3\nVolume of Nitrogen = 0.80 \u00d7 200 cm\u00b3\nVolume of Nitrogen = 160 cm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the approximate volume of nitrogen is 160 cm\u00b3.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nA volume of 20 cm\u00b3 would represent 10% of the total 200 cm\u00b3 volume of air (20 cm\u00b3 / 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.10 or 10%). Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, making up approximately 80% of the air by volume. Therefore, a value of 10% is a significant underestimate of the amount of nitrogen present.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis answer represents a common misconception. Air is approximately 20% (or 1/5) oxygen. Calculating 20% of the total volume of air gives:\n\nVolume = 20% of 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.20 \u00d7 200 cm\u00b3 = 40 cm\u00b3\n\nThis value of 40 cm\u00b3 is the approximate volume of *oxygen* in the sample of air, not nitrogen. Nitrogen is about four times more abundant than oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nA volume of 80 cm\u00b3 would correspond to 40% of the total 200 cm\u00b3 volume of air (80 cm\u00b3 / 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.40 or 40%).

The apparatus shown includes a measuring cylinder to measure the volume of the gas. However, to calculate the rate (Volume of gas / Time), an instrument to measure time is also required. A stop-watch is the standard laboratory instrument for this purpose.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer (A) balance:**\n    A balance is used to measure mass. While the initial mass of the magnesium ribbon would be measured before the experiment to control the variables, a balance is not used to determine the rate of reaction in this particular experimental setup, which measures the volume of gas produced over time.

Isotopes are different forms of the same element. Therefore, all isotopes of a particular element must have the same number of protons. For example, Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14 are all isotopes of carbon, and each has 6 protons in its nucleus.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) They have different electron arrangements.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Since isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons, their neutral atoms also have the same number of electrons. The arrangement of electrons in shells is determined by the number of electrons, so isotopes of the same element have identical electron arrangements. This is why isotopes exhibit the same chemical properties.\n\n**B) They have different nuclear charges.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The charge of a nucleus is determined by the number of positively charged protons it contains, as neutrons have no charge. Since all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons, they have the same nuclear charge.\n\n**C) They have nuclei with masses that are the same.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Isotopes of an element are defined by having the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. The mass of a nucleus is determined by the total number of protons and neutrons (the mass number). Because isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, their nuclei have different masses.

To achieve a stable electron configuration, the potassium atom transfers its single valence electron to the iodine atom. A neutral potassium atom has an equal number of protons and electrons (19 of each). When it loses one electron, it forms a positive ion, or cation (K\u207a). This ion still contains 19 protons in its nucleus, but it now has only 18 electrons. Therefore, the resulting potassium ion has more protons than electrons, giving it an overall positive charge of +1.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Each potassium atom shares a pair of electrons with an iodine atom.**\nThis statement describes covalent bonding, which involves the sharing of electrons between non-metal atoms. The reaction between potassium (a metal) and iodine (a non-metal) involves the complete transfer of an electron from the potassium atom to the iodine atom. This transfer of electrons results in the formation of oppositely charged ions (K\u207a and I\u207b) which are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction. This type of bonding is known as ionic bonding, not covalent bonding.\n\n**C. Potassium iodide has a high melting point because it is a covalent compound.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the reason provided is false. Potassium iodide is an ionic compound, not a covalent one. While it is true that potassium iodide has a high melting point, this is a characteristic property of ionic compounds. Ionic compounds form a giant ionic lattice structure with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the positive (K\u207a) and negative (I\u207b) ions. A large amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these strong forces and break down the lattice, resulting in high melting and boiling points.\n\n**D. Potassium iodide has a low melting point because it is an ionic compound.**\nThis statement is incorrect because ionic compounds, including potassium iodide, have high melting and boiling points, not low ones.

The molar ratio is 1:1.\n\n2.  **Relative Formula Masses (Mr):** To convert between moles and mass, we need the relative formula masses of the reactants.

While the balanced equation shows a 1:1 *molar* ratio, the masses of one mole of each substance are different. The relative formula mass of CaCO\u2083 is 100, and the relative formula mass of SO\u2082 is 64. Therefore, 100 g of CaCO\u2083 react with 64 g of SO\u2082, not 1 g with 1 g. The correct calculation shows that 1.5625 tonnes of CaCO\u2083 are required, not 1 tonne.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect as it likely stems from a misunderstanding of the mass ratio. The value 64 corresponds to the relative formula mass of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), not the required mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083). The correct reacting mass ratio of CaCO\u2083 to SO\u2082 is 100:64. To find the required mass of CaCO\u2083, one must use this ratio correctly: (100/64) \u00d7 1 tonne = 1.5625 tonnes.

The value 100 is the relative formula mass of CaCO\u2083, meaning 100 tonnes of CaCO\u2083 would be required to remove 64 tonnes of SO\u2082, according to the stoichiometric mass ratio of 100:64.

It serves only as a surface for the reaction to occur and to conduct electricity. Platinum is a very unreactive metal, meaning it does not readily react with the electrolyte or the products formed. Because of this chemical stability, it is frequently used as an inert electrode in various electrolytic processes. Graphite (a form of carbon) is another commonly used inert electrode.\n\n**Incorrect Answer A**\n\n*   **Explanation:** The electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide (PbBr\u2082) involves the breakdown of the ionic compound into its constituent elements. In the molten state, the compound contains lead(II) ions (Pb\u00b2\u207a) and bromide ions (Br\u207b). There is no water, and therefore no source of hydrogen. During electrolysis, the positive lead(II) ions are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode) where they are reduced to form molten lead metal. The negative bromide ions are attracted to the positive electrode (anode) where they are oxidised to form bromine gas. The products are lead and bromine, not bromine and hydrogen.\n\n**Incorrect Answer B**\n\n*   **Explanation:** In electrolysis, the positive electrode is called the anode, and the negative electrode is called the cathode. Metal ions (cations) are positively charged (e.g., Na\u207a, Cu\u00b2\u207a, Pb\u00b2\u207a). Due to electrostatic attraction, these positive ions are attracted to the negatively charged electrode (the cathode). At the cathode, the metal ions gain electrons (are reduced) and are deposited as neutral metal atoms. Therefore, metals are formed at the negative electrode (cathode), not the positive electrode.\n\n**Incorrect Answer C**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Electrolysis requires a substance, known as an electrolyte, that can conduct electricity. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain mobile, charged particles (ions). Covalent compounds consist of neutral molecules and do not contain free-moving ions, even when molten. As a result, most molten covalent compounds do not conduct electricity and cannot be broken down by it.

The degree to which a reaction is exothermic is indicated by the magnitude of the temperature rise. To identify the least exothermic reaction, we must first identify all the exothermic reactions and then compare their temperature changes.\n\n1.  **Identify Exothermic Reactions:** Reactions are exothermic if the final temperature is higher than the initial temperature.\n    *   Reaction A: Temperature increases from 19 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C.

Comparing the temperature increases, +4 \u00b0C (Reaction D) is less than +6 \u00b0C (Reaction A). Therefore, reaction D is the least exothermic.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A\nThis reaction is exothermic because the temperature increases from 19 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. The temperature change is +6 \u00b0C. While this is an exothermic reaction, it is not the *least* exothermic among the choices. Reaction D is also exothermic, with a temperature change of +4 \u00b0C (from 22 \u00b0C to 26 \u00b0C). Since the temperature increase for reaction D (+4 \u00b0C) is smaller than for reaction A (+6 \u00b0C), reaction D is less exothermic than reaction A.\n\n#### B\nThis reaction shows a temperature decrease from 21 \u00b0C to 18 \u00b0C. A reaction that causes a decrease in the temperature of its surroundings is an endothermic reaction, as it absorbs heat energy. The question asks for the least *exothermic* reaction.

To increase the rate of the reaction between solid calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid, the frequency of these effective collisions must be increased.\n\n1.  **Increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid:** This increases the number of hydrogen ions (H\u207a) per unit volume of the solution. With more reactant particles in the same space, the frequency of collisions between the hydrogen ions and the surface of the calcium carbonate increases, leading to a faster reaction rate.\n\n2.  **Increasing the surface area of calcium carbonate:** This can be achieved by using a fine powder instead of large chips. A larger surface area exposes more calcium carbonate particles to the hydrochloric acid. This increases the number of sites available for reaction, thereby increasing the frequency of effective collisions and accelerating the reaction rate.\n\nTherefore, increasing both the concentration of the acid and the surface area of the solid will increase the rate of reaction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** Decreasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid would reduce the number of reactant particles in the solution, leading to a lower frequency of collisions. Similarly, decreasing the surface area of the calcium carbonate would expose fewer particles for reaction, also reducing the collision frequency. Both of these changes would decrease, not increase, the rate of reaction.\n\n**B:** While increasing the surface area of the calcium carbonate would increase the reaction rate, decreasing the concentration of the hydrochloric acid would have the opposite effect, slowing the reaction down. For the overall rate to increase, both factors should ideally contribute positively or the positive effect should outweigh the negative one. This option includes a change that decreases the rate.\n\n**C:** While increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid would increase the reaction rate, decreasing the surface area of the calcium carbonate (e.g., using larger chips) would decrease the rate. This is because fewer solid particles are exposed to the acid, reducing the frequency of effective collisions. This option includes a change that decreases the rate."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_375.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 zinc reacts slowly with dilute sulfuric acid at room temperature.\nbubbles of a gas, l, form on the surface of the zinc.\nwhen a small amount of copper is added, the reaction is faster.\nwhich row identifies l and explains why the reaction is faster?\n[ea [meme\nin reaction\n\na hydrogen copper acts as a catalyst\n\nb hydrogen copper is more reactive than zinc\n\ncc oxygen copper acts as a catalyst\n\nd oxygen copper is more reactive than zinc", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe reaction between zinc metal and dilute sulfuric acid is a single displacement reaction. Zinc is more reactive than hydrogen, so it displaces hydrogen from the acid to form zinc sulfate and hydrogen gas.\n\n**Chemical Equation:**\nZn(s) + H\u2082SO\u2084(aq) \u2192 ZnSO\u2084(aq) + H\u2082(g)\n\nTherefore, the gas L formed is hydrogen (H\u2082).\n\nWhen a small amount of copper is added, the rate of reaction increases. Copper is less reactive than zinc and is also less reactive than hydrogen, so it does not react with the dilute sulfuric acid. Instead, it acts as a catalyst. The presence of the less reactive copper, in contact with the more reactive zinc in an electrolyte (the acid), sets up a simple electrochemical cell. The zinc atoms are oxidised more readily (Zn \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b), and the electrons flow to the copper surface. The copper surface provides an alternative site for the reduction of hydrogen ions (2H\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 H\u2082), which lowers the activation energy for the reaction. Because the copper is not consumed in the overall reaction and it increases the reaction rate, it functions as a catalyst.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies the gas formed as hydrogen. However, the reason provided for the increased reaction rate is incorrect. The reactivity series shows that zinc is more reactive than copper. If copper were more reactive than zinc, it would react with the sulfuric acid itself, likely faster than the zinc, which is not what is observed. The premise that \"copper is more reactive than zinc\" is factually incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly identifies the gas formed as oxygen. The reaction between a metal and a dilute acid produces hydrogen gas, not oxygen. While the explanation that copper acts as a catalyst is correct, the initial identification of the gas is wrong, making the entire option incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons.

When water is added, a hydration reaction occurs, forming hydrated copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O). The incorporation of water molecules into the crystal lattice structure causes a distinct colour change. Hydrated copper(II) sulfate is a blue crystalline solid. Therefore, adding water to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate results in a colour change from white to blue.

Iron(III) oxide is reduced and carbon monoxide is oxidised.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the chemical changes occurring in the reaction. We can analyse this using the concepts of oxidation and reduction in terms of oxygen transfer or changes in oxidation state.\n\n*   **Reduction of Iron(III) Oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083):** The reactant iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) is converted into the product iron (Fe). This process involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the iron compound. The loss of oxygen is defined as **reduction**.\n    *   From an oxidation state perspective, the oxidation state of iron in Fe\u2082O\u2083 is +3. In its elemental form (Fe), its oxidation state is 0. A decrease in oxidation state signifies reduction.\n\n*   **Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide (CO):** The reactant carbon monoxide (CO) is converted into the product carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). This process involves the addition of an oxygen atom to the carbon monoxide molecule. The gain of oxygen is defined as **oxidation**.\n    *   From an oxidation state perspective, the oxidation state of carbon in CO is +2. In CO\u2082, its oxidation state is +4.

Both iron(III) oxide and carbon monoxide are oxidised.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because oxidation and reduction are complementary processes that must occur together in a redox reaction. One substance loses electrons (is oxidised) while another gains them (is reduced). It is not possible for both reactants to be oxidised. As established, iron(III) oxide loses oxygen, meaning it is reduced, not oxidised.\n\n**B. Both iron(III) oxide and carbon monoxide are reduced.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for the same reason as option A. In a redox reaction, if one reactant is reduced, another must be oxidised. It is not possible for both reactants to be reduced. In this case, carbon monoxide gains oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is an oxidation process, not reduction.\n\n**C. Iron(III) oxide is oxidised and carbon monoxide is reduced.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly reverses the roles of the reactants. Iron(III) oxide loses oxygen, which is reduction, not oxidation.

Hydrogen gas is formed when a reactive metal (like magnesium, Mg) reacts directly with an acid. The reaction of a metal *carbonate* (MgCO\u2083) with an acid involves the carbonate ion (CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b), which reacts to form carbon dioxide and water, not hydrogen gas.\n\n**B:** This option is incomplete.

A fundamental property of all metals is their ability to conduct electricity. This arises from their giant metallic lattice structure, which consists of a regular arrangement of positive metal ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not bound to any single atom and are free to move throughout the lattice. When a voltage is applied, these mobile charge carriers flow, creating an electric current.

The statement incorrectly reverses the density relationship between lithium and sodium.\n\n*   **Statement 2: Sodium is more reactive than potassium.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Chemical reactivity for Group I metals increases as you descend the group. This is because the outermost electron is progressively further from the nucleus and is shielded by more inner electron shells.

A lighter aircraft requires less energy (fuel) to achieve and maintain flight, making it more economically viable and efficient.\n3.  **Corrosion Resistance:** Aircraft are exposed to various weather conditions, including moisture and oxygen, which can cause metals to corrode. Corrosion weakens the material, compromising the structural integrity and safety of the aircraft.

Stainless steel is an alloy of iron that contains a significant amount of chromium (typically at least 10.5%). The chromium reacts with oxygen in the air to form a very thin, passive layer of chromium(III) oxide on the surface of the steel. This invisible layer is highly resistant to corrosion and prevents the iron from reacting with oxygen and water, which would cause it to rust. Because cutlery is frequently exposed to moisture and various substances in food, this resistance to rusting is the primary property that makes stainless steel an ideal material for its manufacture.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** While it is true that aluminium is used for overhead electrical cables, the reason provided is incorrect. Aluminium is chosen for this application because it has a **low density** and is a good conductor of electricity. Its low density makes the cables much lighter than if they were made of copper (another excellent conductor), which means the supporting pylons do not need to be as strong or as numerous, reducing construction costs. The statement incorrectly claims it is used because of a *high* density.\n\n*   **B:** Aluminium is widely used to make food containers, such as cans and foil. However, the reason it is suitable for this purpose is not its electrical conductivity. The key properties are that it is non-toxic, has a low density (lightweight), is malleable (can be easily shaped), and, most importantly, it is resistant to corrosion. This resistance comes from a thin, tough, and unreactive layer of aluminium oxide that naturally forms on its surface, protecting the food from the metal. Electrical conductivity is an irrelevant property for a food container.\n\n*   **D:** Stainless steel is indeed used to construct chemical reactors, but the reason given is false.

This position determines its chemical properties.\n\n1.  **Reaction with dilute acids:** A metal's ability to react with dilute acids (like HCl or H\u2082SO\u2084) to produce hydrogen gas depends on its reactivity relative to hydrogen. Only metals that are more reactive than hydrogen (i.e., above hydrogen in the series) can displace hydrogen from dilute acids. Since metal X is below hydrogen in the series, it is less reactive than hydrogen and will **not** react with dilute acids.\n\n2.  **Reduction of oxide by carbon:** Carbon is used as a reducing agent to extract metals from their oxides. Carbon can reduce the oxides of metals that are less reactive than it. In the reactivity series, carbon is more reactive than hydrogen and copper. Since metal X is less reactive than hydrogen, it is also significantly less reactive than carbon.

For rusting to occur, two substances are essential: **oxygen** and **water**.\n\nThe overall chemical reaction for the formation of rust (hydrated iron(III) oxide) can be summarized as:\nIron + Oxygen + Water \u2192 Hydrated iron(III) oxide\n4Fe(s) + 3O\u2082(g) + 2nH\u2082O(l) \u2192 2Fe\u2082O\u2083\u00b7nH\u2082O(s)\n\nIn this redox reaction, iron is oxidized (loses electrons) and oxygen is reduced (gains electrons). Oxygen, which makes up approximately 21% of the air, acts as the oxidizing agent. Without oxygen, this reaction cannot proceed, and iron will not rust.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Argon**\nArgon (Ar) is a noble gas, located in Group 18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are characterized by having a full outer shell of electrons, which makes them chemically inert or unreactive under normal conditions. Consequently, argon does not participate in the chemical reactions that lead to the rusting of iron.\n\n**B. Carbon Dioxide**\nWhile carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is not a required reactant for rust formation, its presence can accelerate the rate of rusting. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form weak carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083). This acidic solution acts as an electrolyte, facilitating the electrochemical process of corrosion. However, rusting will still occur in the absence of carbon dioxide, as long as oxygen and water are present. Therefore, it is not an essential gas for the process.\n\n**C. Nitrogen**\nNitrogen (N\u2082) is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, comprising about 78% of the air. The nitrogen molecule contains a very strong triple covalent bond between its two atoms. A significant amount of energy is required to break this bond, making molecular nitrogen very unreactive under normal atmospheric conditions.

Silicon dioxide is an acidic oxide with a very high melting point. To remove this impurity, limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO\u2083) is added to the furnace.\n\nAt the high temperatures within the furnace, the limestone undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).\n**CaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 CaO(s) + CO\u2082(g)**\n\nCalcium oxide is a basic oxide.

This allows it to be tapped off separately, effectively removing the impurities from the iron.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: It neutralises the molten slag produced.**\nThis statement is incorrect because limestone does not neutralise the slag; its decomposition product reacts with impurities to *form* the slag. Slag (calcium silicate) is the product of the neutralisation reaction between the basic calcium oxide (from limestone) and the acidic impurity (silicon dioxide). The process neutralises the impurity, not the slag itself.\n\n**C: It releases carbon dioxide which reduces the iron(III) oxide.**\nWhile limestone does decompose to release carbon dioxide (CaCO\u2083 \u2192 CaO + CO\u2082), carbon dioxide is not the reducing agent in the blast furnace. The primary reducing agent is carbon monoxide (CO), which is produced from the reaction of coke (carbon) with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide reduces the iron(III) oxide to iron: **Fe\u2082O\u2083 + 3CO \u2192 2Fe + 3CO\u2082**. Carbon dioxide is a product of this reduction, not the reactant that causes it.\n\n**D: It removes acidic gases such as carbon dioxide.**\nThis is incorrect.

During this process, they take in carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the atmosphere and water (H\u2082O) from the soil. Using energy from sunlight, they convert these reactants into glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), which is used for energy and growth, and oxygen (O\u2082), which is released back into the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide is a key reactant consumed in this process, photosynthesis is the primary natural mechanism for removing CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. The overall chemical equation is:\n\n6CO\u2082(g) + 6H\u2082O(l) \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086(aq) + 6O\u2082(g)\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B - thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate**\nThis process adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, rather than removing it. Thermal decomposition is the breakdown of a compound by heating. When calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083), the main component of limestone, is heated strongly, it decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (CO\u2082). This reaction is fundamental to the industrial production of cement and lime and is a significant source of atmospheric CO\u2082. The equation is:\n\nCaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 CaO(s) + CO\u2082(g)\n\n**C - combustion of fossil fuels**\nThis process is a major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are primarily composed of hydrocarbons. Combustion is a rapid reaction between a substance with an oxidant, usually oxygen, to produce heat and light. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons produces carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O). As vast quantities of fossil fuels are burned for energy, large amounts of CO\u2082 are released into the atmosphere. For example, the combustion of methane (CH\u2084), the main component of natural gas, is:\n\nCH\u2084(g) + 2O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g) + 2H\u2082O(g)\n\n**D - reaction of sodium carbonate with an acid**\nThis chemical reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, thus adding it to the atmosphere. When a carbonate, such as sodium carbonate (Na\u2082CO\u2083), reacts with an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl), the products are a salt (sodium chloride, NaCl), water (H\u2082O), and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). This is a characteristic reaction of carbonates and is often used as a laboratory test for them. The equation is:\n\nNa\u2082CO\u2083(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 2NaCl(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + CO\u2082(g)"}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_391.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "31 the flow chart shows stages in the treatment of river water to produce drinking water.\nriver sedimentation stage stage drinking\nwater tank j k water\nwhat occurs at stages j and k?\npot ooe tk\na distillation chlorination\nb distillation filtration\ncc filtration chlorination\nd filtration distillation", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe flow chart illustrates the standard process for purifying river water to make it potable (safe for drinking).\n\n1.  **Sedimentation:** In the sedimentation tank, larger, insoluble solid impurities are allowed to settle to the bottom.

Filtration is the next logical step. The water is passed through filter beds, typically made of layers of sand and gravel. This process physically removes the remaining small solid particles, leaving the water clear.\n3.  **Stage K - Chlorination:** Although the water is now clear, it may still contain harmful microorganisms like bacteria and viruses. Chlorination is a method of disinfection where a small, controlled amount of chlorine is added to the water.

Filtration is the standard industrial process used at this stage to remove fine solid particles. While chlorination is a correct final step, the initial process identified for stage J is incorrect for municipal water treatment.\n\n**B: J = distillation, K = filtration**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option A, distillation is not used in large-scale water treatment due to its high cost. Secondly, the order is illogical. Filtration removes solid particles, while the final stage must be disinfection to kill microorganisms. Placing filtration after a highly effective purification method like distillation would be redundant and inefficient.\n\n**D: J = filtration, K = distillation**\nWhile filtration is the correct process for Stage J, using distillation as the final step (Stage K) is incorrect. The primary goal of the final stage is disinfection to kill harmful microorganisms.

Its two primary components are nitrogen, which makes up approximately 78% of the air, and oxygen, which makes up about 21%. Fractional distillation is a physical separation technique used to separate a mixture of liquids with different boiling points.\n\nThe process involves the following steps:\n1.  **Purification and Liquefaction:** Air is first filtered to remove dust. Then, it is cooled to a low temperature (around -80\u00b0C) to freeze water vapor and carbon dioxide, which are removed as solids. The remaining air is then cooled further to approximately -200\u00b0C under high pressure, causing it to turn into a liquid.\n2.  **Fractional Distillation:** The liquid air, now primarily a mixture of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen, is pumped into a fractionating column. The column is warmer at the bottom and colder at the top.\n3.  **Separation:** Liquid nitrogen has a lower boiling point (-196\u00b0C) than liquid oxygen (-183\u00b0C). As the liquid air is gently warmed, the nitrogen boils first, turning into a gas. This nitrogen gas rises to the top of the column, where it is piped off and can be condensed back into a liquid for storage. The liquid oxygen, with its higher boiling point, remains at the bottom of the column and is collected.\n\nSince nitrogen and oxygen are the most abundant gases in the air, they are the main substances produced by this industrial process.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. oxygen and carbon dioxide**\nThis option is incorrect because carbon dioxide is removed from the air *before* the fractional distillation process begins. Carbon dioxide turns from a gas to a solid (sublimes) at -78.5\u00b0C. To liquefy air, temperatures must be lowered to around -200\u00b0C. If carbon dioxide were not removed, it would freeze into a solid and block the pipes and equipment.

Fractional distillation is used to separate this mixture into simpler groups of hydrocarbons called fractions. The crude oil is heated and passed into a fractionating column, where it separates based on boiling points. The naphtha fraction, containing alkanes with 5 to 12 carbon atoms, is collected for the next stage.\n\n2.  **Cracking:** The alkanes in the naphtha fraction are long-chain saturated hydrocarbons. To produce poly(ethene), the monomer ethene (C\u2082H\u2084), which is a small, unsaturated alkene, is required. Cracking is a thermal decomposition process that breaks down large alkane molecules into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes. The naphtha fraction is heated to a high temperature (typically 600\u2013900\u00b0C) and passed over a catalyst (e.g., aluminium oxide or silicon dioxide), which causes the long-chain alkanes to 'crack' and form products including ethene.\n\n3.  **Polymerisation:** Once the ethene monomers have been produced and purified, they undergo addition polymerisation. In this process, the double bond in each ethene molecule breaks, and thousands of monomer molecules join together to form a very long-chain molecule called poly(ethene). This is typically carried out under high pressure and temperature, often with a catalyst.\n\nThis sequence, fractional distillation \u2192 cracking \u2192 polymerisation, represents the correct industrial pathway from petroleum to poly(ethene).\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis sequence is incorrect because cracking is not the initial step in processing petroleum. Petroleum is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Performing cracking on the entire crude oil mixture would be highly inefficient and would produce an extremely complex mixture of products that would then be very difficult to separate. The standard industrial process involves first separating the crude oil into its constituent fractions via fractional distillation. Only then is a specific, suitable fraction (like naphtha) subjected to cracking to produce the desired alkenes.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis sequence is incorrect for several reasons. Firstly, cracking must occur before polymerisation, as cracking is the process that produces the ethene monomers required for polymerisation. Secondly, fractional distillation is the primary step used to separate crude oil into useful fractions; it is not a final step performed after a polymer has been synthesized. Polymers like poly(ethene) are solids with very high melting points and cannot be separated using a standard fractional distillation column designed for liquid hydrocarbons.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis sequence is incorrect because polymerisation cannot occur directly after fractional distillation. The fractions obtained from petroleum, such as naphtha, are composed primarily of alkanes. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons (containing only single C-C bonds) and cannot undergo addition polymerisation. The process requires unsaturated monomers with C=C double bonds, such as ethene. Therefore, the cracking step is essential to convert the saturated alkanes into unsaturated alkene monomers before polymerisation can take place. Placing cracking at the end of the sequence is illogical, as it would involve breaking down the final polymer product, which is the reverse of the intended manufacturing process."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_396.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "36 gas oil and naphtha are two fractions obtained from petroleum.\nwhat are uses of gas oil and naphtha?\n[ [asset | nehthe |\na jet fuel making chemicals\nb jet fuel making roads\ncc diesel engine fuel making chemicals\nd diesel engine fuel making roads", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies the primary uses for both petroleum fractions.\n\n*   **Gas Oil:** This fraction consists of hydrocarbons with typically 15 to 25 carbon atoms per molecule.

The electrons from the broken double bond are then used to form new single covalent bonds with adjacent monomer units. This results in a long, saturated hydrocarbon chain. The structure shown in C, -[CH\u2082-CH\u2082]n-, correctly represents the repeating unit of poly(ethene). The two carbon atoms are linked by a single bond, and the bonds extending from the ends of the unit indicate its connection to other units in the polymer chain. The 'n' signifies that this unit is repeated a large number of times.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n**A**\nThis diagram shows the structure of a single molecule of ethene (C\u2082H\u2084). Ethene is the monomer, which is the small molecule reactant used to form the polymer. The question asks for the structure of the product of polymerisation, which is the large polymer molecule, not the starting monomer.\n\n**B**\nThis diagram incorrectly shows a repeating unit that still contains a carbon-carbon double bond. During addition polymerisation of ethene, the double bond must break to allow the monomers to link together. The resulting polymer, poly(ethene), has a backbone consisting entirely of carbon-carbon single bonds, making it a saturated polymer. A structure with a repeating double bond in the main chain is not formed in this reaction.\n\n**D**\nThis diagram represents a single molecule of but-2-ene (C\u2084H\u2088), which is an alkene with four carbon atoms. A polymer is a very large molecule (a macromolecule) made of many repeating units. This structure is a small, discrete molecule, not a polymer.

A volumetric pipette is a piece of laboratory glassware specifically designed to deliver a single, fixed, and highly accurate volume of liquid (e.g., 25.0 cm\u00b3). The value \"25.0 cm\u00b3\" implies a high degree of precision, which is characteristic of the measurements made with a volumetric pipette. Therefore, using a volumetric pipette to measure the aqueous alkali is the correct procedure.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. The 25.0 cm\u00b3 of aqueous alkali is measured using the lines on the conical flask.**\nThis is incorrect. A conical flask (or Erlenmeyer flask) is designed to hold the reaction mixture. Its tapered shape allows for vigorous swirling or mixing of the contents without splashing. The volume markings on the side of a conical flask are only approximate and are not calibrated for accurate volumetric measurements. Using these markings would introduce a significant error into the experiment, making the results unreliable.\n\n**C. The volume of acid is measured using a measuring cylinder.**\nThis is incorrect. The acid is the titrant, and its volume must be measured very accurately to determine the endpoint of the titration. A measuring cylinder provides only a low level of precision and is used for making approximate measurements. The correct piece of apparatus for delivering the titrant and measuring the volume used (the titre) is a burette, which allows for precise measurement to two decimal places (e.g., \u00b10.05 cm\u00b3).\n\n**D. The volume of acid is measured using a volumetric pipette.**\nThis is incorrect. A volumetric pipette is designed to deliver a single, *fixed* volume of liquid. In a titration, the volume of the titrant (the acid, in this case) that is added is *variable*; it is added until the indicator changes colour. The purpose of the titration is to determine this variable volume. Therefore, a fixed-volume instrument like a pipette is unsuitable.

When the mixture is heated, the liquid with the lower boiling point, methanol, will vaporise first. The vapour rises through the fractionating column, which provides a large surface area for repeated condensation and vaporisation, effectively separating the vapours. The pure methanol vapour then passes into the condenser, where it is cooled and turns back into a liquid (distillate) before being collected.

Solids are easy to compress.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In a solid, particles are arranged in a fixed, regular pattern (a lattice) and are packed very tightly together. There is minimal empty space between the particles. Because the particles are already so close, it is very difficult to force them any closer together by applying pressure. Therefore, solids are considered to be incompressible.\n\n**B. Liquids are easy to compress.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The particles in a liquid are also packed closely together, although they are not in fixed positions and can move past one another. Similar to solids, there is very little free space between the particles. This lack of empty space means that liquids, like solids, are very difficult to compress and are considered to be virtually incompressible.\n\n**C. Liquids expand to fill their container.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A liquid has a definite volume but does not have a fixed shape. While a liquid will take the shape of the part of the container it occupies, it will not expand to fill the entire volume of the container. The forces of attraction between the particles in a liquid are strong enough to hold them together as a distinct volume. For example, 100 cm\u00b3 of water placed in a 250 cm\u00b3 beaker will only fill the beaker to the 100 cm\u00b3 mark; it will not expand to occupy the full 250 cm\u00b3."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_402.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "2 which substance is a mixture?\na. air\nbs graphite\nc oxygen\nd_ water", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA mixture is a substance made by combining two or more different materials in such a way that no chemical reaction occurs.

The reaction between sodium and chlorine is a classic example of ionic bonding.\n\n1.  **Electronic Configuration of Sodium:** Sodium (Na) is a Group 1 element with the electron configuration 2, 8, 1. It has one electron in its outermost shell (valence shell).\n2.  **Achieving Stability:** To achieve a stable, full outer shell of electrons (an octet), the sodium atom will lose its single valence electron. This process is described by statement 4: **Sodium atoms lose electrons**.\n3.  **Formation of an Ion:** A neutral sodium atom contains an equal number of positive protons (11) and negative electrons (11). When it loses one electron, it still has 11 protons but now only 10 electrons. The imbalance results in a net charge of +1. Therefore, the sodium atom becomes a positive ion (a cation), specifically Na\u207a.

It consists of one central nitrogen atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. Nitrogen is in Group 15 of the Periodic Table and has five valence electrons. To achieve a stable electron configuration (an octet), it needs to form three more bonds. Hydrogen is in Group 1 and has one valence electron; it needs one more electron to achieve a stable configuration (a duet). The nitrogen atom shares one electron with each of the three hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen atom shares its single electron with the nitrogen atom. This sharing of electrons forms three single covalent bonds (N-H bonds) and leaves the nitrogen atom with one lone pair of electrons.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It conducts electricity when liquid.**\nThis statement is incorrect. For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile charged particles, such as delocalised electrons or free-moving ions. Ammonia is a simple molecular compound. In its liquid state, it exists as discrete, neutral NH\u2083 molecules. There are no delocalised electrons or free ions to carry an electrical current. Therefore, liquid ammonia does not conduct electricity.\n\n**C. It has a high boiling point.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Ammonia has a simple molecular structure with weak intermolecular forces of attraction (specifically, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces) between its molecules. Only a small amount of energy is required to overcome these forces and change the state from liquid to gas. Consequently, ammonia has a low boiling point of -33.34 \u00b0C. Substances with high boiling points typically have giant structures (ionic, metallic, or giant covalent) where strong bonds must be broken or overcome.\n\n**D. It has a giant covalent structure.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Ammonia has a simple molecular structure, meaning it is composed of individual, discrete NH\u2083 molecules. In contrast, a giant covalent structure consists of a vast, three-dimensional lattice of atoms all joined by strong covalent bonds, such as in diamond or silicon dioxide.

Each carbon atom forms strong covalent bonds with three other carbon atoms, creating extensive layers of hexagonal rings. These layers are held together by weak intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). Because it consists of a vast, continuous network of covalently bonded atoms, it is classified as a giant covalent structure.\n*   **Use:** The weak forces between the layers allow them to slide easily over one another. This property makes graphite soft and slippery, and therefore an excellent solid lubricant. It is also used in pencil 'leads'.\n\n**Incorrect Answer B**\n\n*   While the structure of graphite is correctly identified as giant covalent, its use is not for cutting tools. Graphite is a soft material because its layers can slide. Cutting tools require exceptionally hard materials. Diamond, another allotrope of carbon, has a different giant covalent structure where each carbon atom is bonded to four others, creating a rigid, three-dimensional lattice. This makes diamond extremely hard and suitable for use in cutting tools.\n\n**Incorrect Answer C**\n\n*   This option is incorrect because it misidentifies the structure of graphite. Graphite is not a simple molecular substance. Simple molecular substances consist of small, discrete molecules (e.g., H\u2082O, CO\u2082) with weak forces between them. Graphite consists of a continuous lattice of covalently bonded atoms, which is characteristic of a giant covalent structure. Although its use as a lubricant is correct, the incorrect description of its structure makes this option wrong.\n\n**Incorrect Answer D**\n\n*   This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, graphite has a giant covalent structure, not a simple molecular one.

However, hydroxide ions are discharged in preference to sulfate ions. The hydroxide ions lose electrons (are oxidized) to form oxygen gas and water.\n        *   Half-equation: 4OH\u207b(aq) \u2192 2H\u2082O(l) + O\u2082(g) + 4e\u207b\n\n    Therefore, the gases produced and collected are hydrogen (H\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082). The overall process is the decomposition of water, with sulfuric acid acting as an electrolyte to allow the conduction of electricity.\n\n2.  **Ignition of the Gaseous Mixture:**\n    The collected gases, hydrogen and oxygen, are mixed and ignited. Ignition provides the activation energy for a highly exothermic synthesis reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen combusts in oxygen to form water.\n    *   Balanced chemical equation: 2H\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 2H\u2082O(l)\n\n    The product of this reaction is water. This reaction is famously used as the \"squeaky pop\" test for hydrogen gas.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n*   **A. hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S):** To form hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen would need to react with sulfur. During the electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid, the sulfate ion (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) is not discharged, so no elemental sulfur is produced. Therefore, sulfur is not available to react.\n*   **B. sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082):** The formation of sulfur dioxide requires the presence of sulfur in the reactants. The gases being ignited are only hydrogen and oxygen. There is no source of sulfur in this second reaction.\n*   **C. sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084):** The synthesis of sulfuric acid from hydrogen and oxygen is not possible without a source of sulfur.

A colourless gas is produced at the negative electrode.**\nPositive ions (cations) are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode). Sodium ions (Na\u207a) move to the cathode and undergo reduction by gaining electrons to form molten sodium metal (Na). Sodium is a silver-coloured metal, not a colourless gas. The half-equation at the cathode is: Na\u207a(l) + e\u207b \u2192 Na(l).\n\n**C. A silver-coloured metal is produced at the positive electrode.**\nMetals are formed from the reduction of positive ions (cations). This process occurs at the negative electrode (cathode), where electrons are supplied. The positive electrode (anode) attracts negative ions (anions) and is the site of oxidation (loss of electrons). Therefore, a metal would be formed at the negative electrode, not the positive one.\n\n**D. No change is observed because the electrodes are inert.**\nInert electrodes, such as graphite or platinum, do not participate in the chemical reaction. However, they serve as surfaces for the redox reactions to occur and as conductors to complete the electrical circuit.

Although the complete combustion of petrol (a mixture of hydrocarbons) does produce carbon dioxide and water, petrol itself is not the fuel used in the type of fuel cells that power modern electric vehicles.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, petrol is not the fuel used in a fuel cell. Secondly, petrol is a mixture of hydrocarbons, which are compounds containing both carbon and hydrogen atoms.

Burning, or combustion, is a chemical reaction. Carbon (C) reacts with oxygen (O\u2082) from the air to form a new substance, carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The chemical equation for this reaction is C(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g). Since a new substance with different chemical properties is formed, this is a chemical change.\n\n*   **B. dissolving copper(II) sulfate crystals in water:** This is a physical change. When copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\u2084) dissolves in water, the crystal lattice breaks down, and the copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) and sulfate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) are surrounded by water molecules.

To reverse it, the water of crystallisation must be removed from the hydrated pink salt. This process is called dehydration and is achieved by heating. Heating provides the energy required to break the bonds between the cobalt(II) chloride and the water molecules, causing the water to evaporate. As the water is driven off, the pink hydrated salt reverts to the blue anhydrous salt. The reverse reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat energy, which is why heating drives the equilibrium to the left, favouring the anhydrous form.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A) adding dilute acid:** A dilute acid is an aqueous solution, meaning it consists of an acid dissolved in water. Adding more water to the system would, according to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, shift the equilibrium to the right, favouring the formation of more of the pink hydrated cobalt(II) chloride. This would promote the forward reaction, not reverse it.\n\n*   **B) filtering:** Filtration is a physical separation technique used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. In hydrated cobalt(II) chloride, the water is not simply mixed with the solid; it is chemically incorporated into the crystal lattice as water of crystallisation. Therefore, filtration cannot be used to remove this chemically bound water.\n\n*   **D) cooling:** The forward reaction (hydration) is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. According to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, if the temperature of the system is decreased (cooled), the equilibrium will shift in the direction that produces heat to counteract the change. This means cooling would favour the exothermic forward reaction, leading to the formation of more pink hydrated cobalt(II) chloride, not the reversal of the reaction."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_416.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "16 ethanol can be turned into ethanoic acid by passing it over hot copper(ii) oxide.\nch3ch20h + 2cuo \u2014 ch3cooh + h20 + 2cu\nwhat is this type of reaction?\na precipitation\nb_ redox\nc_ thermal decomposition\nd neutralisation", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B - redox\n\nA redox reaction is a chemical reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between two species.

This means an additional proton is added to the nucleus and an additional electron is added to the electron shells. Since all elements within the same period occupy the same number of principal energy levels (electron shells), this new electron is added to the outermost shell. Therefore, the number of outer-shell (valence) electrons **increases** across a period. For example, in Period 3, sodium (Na) has 1 outer-shell electron, magnesium (Mg) has 2, aluminium (Al) has 3, and so on, up to argon (Ar) which has 8.\n\n2.  **Metallic character:** Metallic character refers to the tendency of an atom to lose its valence electrons. As we move across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases, leading to a greater positive nuclear charge. This stronger positive charge pulls the negatively charged outer-shell electrons more tightly towards the nucleus. As a result, it becomes more difficult for an atom to lose its outer electrons (i.e., the first ionisation energy increases). This reduced tendency to lose electrons means that the metallic character of the elements **decreases**. This is why elements on the left side of a period are metals, and they transition to non-metals on the right side.\n\nTherefore, across a period from left to right, the number of outer-shell electrons increases, and the metallic character decreases.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. While it correctly states that metallic character decreases across a period, it incorrectly claims that the number of outer-shell electrons decreases. The number of outer-shell electrons increases from left to right across a period as the atomic number increases.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the number of outer-shell electrons increases, not decreases, across a period. Secondly, the metallic character decreases, not increases, due to the increasing effective nuclear charge that holds the valence electrons more strongly.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect. While it correctly states that the number of outer-shell electrons increases across a period, it incorrectly claims that metallic character also increases.

This is because they have a 'sea' of delocalised electrons that are free to move and carry an electrical current. Therefore, the element must have high electrical conductivity.\n\n2.  **Density:** Group 1 metals are known for their unusually low densities compared to other metals. For example, lithium (0.53 g/cm\u00b3), sodium (0.97 g/cm\u00b3), and potassium (0.86 g/cm\u00b3) are all less dense than water (1.0 g/cm\u00b3).\n\nThe properties listed in this row\u2014high electrical conductivity and a low density of 0.97 g/cm\u00b3\u2014are characteristic of a Group 1 alkali metal.

This density is very high and is more characteristic of a transition metal (e.g., copper has a density of 8.96 g/cm\u00b3), which is not in the same group as lithium. Group 1 metals are distinguished by their low densities.\n\n#### **C**\nThe statement of low electrical conductivity is incorrect. Elements in the same group as lithium are alkali metals, which are excellent conductors of electricity due to their delocalised valence electrons. Low electrical conductivity is a property of non-metals. Although the density of 0.07 g/cm\u00b3 is low, the incorrect conductivity makes this option invalid.\n\n#### **D**\nThe statement of low electrical conductivity is incorrect.

As the group is descended, the atoms become larger due to an increasing number of electron shells. This increases the distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised electrons, weakening the metallic bond. Consequently, less thermal energy is required to overcome these weaker forces, leading to a decrease in melting and boiling points.\n\n*   **Density Increases:** Density is the ratio of mass to volume. As the group is descended, both atomic mass and atomic radius (volume) increase. However, the atomic mass increases more significantly than the atomic volume because a new shell of protons and neutrons is added to the nucleus with each successive element. This results in a general increase in density down the group. (Note: There is a slight anomaly where potassium is less dense than sodium, but the overall trend is an increase).\n\n*   **Reactivity Increases:** The chemical reactivity of Group I elements is determined by their ability to lose their single outermost electron to form a stable +1 ion. As the group is descended, the outermost electron is further from the nucleus and is shielded by more inner electron shells. This reduces the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron, making it easier to remove. Therefore, less energy is required for the reaction to occur, and reactivity increases down the group.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the melting point increases down the group. The melting point of Group I elements decreases as the group is descended. This is because the atomic size increases, which weakens the metallic bonds holding the atoms together in the lattice. Weaker bonds require less energy to break.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option incorrectly describes all three trends. The melting point decreases (not increases) due to weaker metallic bonding. The density generally increases (not decreases) as the atomic mass increases more than the atomic volume. The reactivity increases (not decreases) because it becomes easier to lose the outermost electron down the group.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option incorrectly states that density and reactivity decrease. The density generally increases down the group because the increase in atomic mass is greater than the increase in atomic volume. The reactivity increases down the group because the outermost electron is more easily lost due to increased atomic radius and electron shielding, which weakens its attraction to the nucleus."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_423.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 the elements in group vii include chlorine, bromine and iodine.\nwhich statements are correct?\n1 lodine is more dense than chlorine.\n2 lodine displaces chlorine from a solution containing chloride ions.\n3 bromine is a diatomic non-metal.\n4 chlorine gas is darker in colour than bromine vapour.\na iand2 b 1and3 c 2and4 d 3and4", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation for Statement 1 (Correct):**\nPhysical properties of the halogens (Group VII elements) show clear trends down the group. One such property is density. As you descend Group VII from chlorine to iodine, the atomic number and relative atomic mass of the elements increase. The atoms become larger, and the strength of the intermolecular van der Waals forces between the molecules increases significantly. This leads to the particles being packed more closely together, resulting in an increase in density. Therefore, iodine, which is below chlorine in the group, is denser than chlorine.\n\n**Explanation for Statement 3 (Correct):**\nThe elements in Group VII are non-metals. They are characterised by having seven electrons in their outer shell. To achieve a stable, full outer shell of eight electrons, halogen atoms readily form a single covalent bond with another halogen atom. This results in the formation of diatomic molecules (molecules made of two atoms). Bromine, being a member of Group VII, exists as diatomic molecules, with the chemical formula Br\u2082. Thus, bromine is a diatomic non-metal.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 1 and 2**\nWhile statement 1 is correct, statement 2 is incorrect. The chemical reactivity of the halogens decreases down the group. A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from an aqueous solution of its halide ions. Chlorine is higher up in Group VII than iodine, making it more reactive. Consequently, chlorine can displace iodine from a solution of iodide ions (Cl\u2082 + 2I\u207b \u2192 2Cl\u207b + I\u2082). The reverse reaction, where the less reactive iodine displaces the more reactive chlorine from a solution of chloride ions, cannot occur.\n\n**C: 2 and 4**\nBoth statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.\n*   **Statement 2:** Reactivity in Group VII decreases down the group. Iodine is less reactive than chlorine and therefore cannot displace chlorine from a solution containing chloride ions.\n*   **Statement 4:** The colour of the halogens becomes progressively darker down the group. Chlorine is a pale, greenish-yellow gas. Bromine is a reddish-brown liquid that forms a reddish-brown vapour. Iodine is a greyish-black solid that forms a violet vapour. Therefore, bromine vapour is darker in colour than chlorine gas, not the other way around.\n\n**D: 3 and 4**\nWhile statement 3 is correct, statement 4 is incorrect.

This property arises from the electronic structure of their ions, which have partially filled d-orbitals. When these ions form complexes, the d-orbitals split into different energy levels. Electrons can then be promoted from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy one by absorbing energy from visible light. The colour observed is the complementary colour of the light that is absorbed. For example, hydrated cobalt(II) ions, [Co(H\u2082O)\u2086]\u00b2\u207a, are pink because they absorb light from the green region of the spectrum.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nTransition elements are metals and, like most metals, are good conductors of electricity. Electrical conductivity in metals is due to the presence of delocalised electrons that are free to move throughout the metallic lattice structure and carry an electric charge. Cobalt, being a typical transition metal, possesses these delocalised electrons and is therefore a good electrical conductor, not a poor one. Poor electrical conductors, or insulators, are typically non-metallic elements and compounds.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nTransition elements are generally characterised by high densities. Density is a measure of mass per unit volume. Transition metals have a high atomic mass and a relatively small atomic radius due to the strong effective nuclear charge pulling the electron shells, including the d-orbitals, closer to the nucleus. This results in a large amount of mass packed into a small volume, leading to high density. Cobalt has a high density (8.9 g/cm\u00b3), which is a typical value for a transition metal. Elements with low densities are found in Groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nTransition elements are known for having high melting and boiling points. This is due to the strong metallic bonding within their structures. The strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the lattice of positive metal ions and the \"sea\" of delocalised electrons require a large amount of thermal energy to overcome. The involvement of both s and d-electrons in the metallic bonding contributes to its strength. Cobalt has a high melting point of 1495 \u00b0C, which is characteristic of a transition metal.

Although aluminium is a reactive metal, it readily reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, tough, and unreactive layer of aluminium oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) on its surface. This oxide layer is insoluble and adheres strongly to the metal, acting as a protective barrier. It prevents the underlying aluminium from coming into contact and reacting with the food inside the container, especially with acidic or salty foods. This ensures that the food is not contaminated with aluminium ions, and the container does not degrade over time, preserving the quality and safety of the food.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. conducts heat:** While it is true that aluminium is an excellent conductor of heat, this property is desirable for cooking utensils like pots and pans, where efficient heat transfer is needed to cook the food. For storing food, heat conduction is generally not a required property and can even be undesirable if the goal is to keep food at a stable temperature. The primary requirement for a storage container is that it does not react with its contents.\n\n**B. low density:** Aluminium's low density makes containers lightweight, which is advantageous for handling and transportation, reducing costs. However, this is a secondary benefit. The most critical property for a food container is its chemical inertness to ensure the food remains safe for consumption. A container made of a denser, but still unreactive, material could also be used for storing food, even if it were less convenient. Therefore, low density is not the principal reason for its suitability.\n\n**D. shiny surface:** The shiny, metallic appearance of aluminium is a physical property related to its ability to reflect light.

Firstly, as explained above, water for chemical reactions (2) should ideally be pure and free from chlorine.

Under normal conditions, nitrogen gas (N\u2082) is very unreactive because of the strong triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms. However, the extremely high temperatures and pressures inside a functioning internal combustion engine provide enough energy to overcome the activation energy required to break the bonds in both nitrogen and oxygen molecules. These reactive atoms then combine to form oxides of nitrogen, such as nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Nitrogen reacts with carbon dioxide.**\nCarbon dioxide is a product of the complete combustion of fuel (petrol) in the engine. The formation of nitrogen oxides involves the direct reaction of elemental nitrogen and oxygen from the air.

When disposed of in landfills, they are non-biodegradable, meaning they persist in the environment for hundreds or even thousands of years. This leads to the rapid filling of landfill sites and long-term land pollution. Recycling plastics reduces the volume of waste sent to landfills.\n2.  **Pollution of Water Bodies:** Improperly discarded plastic waste is often carried by wind and rain into rivers, which then transport it to oceans. This plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine and aquatic wildlife, which can become entangled in larger plastic items or ingest smaller plastic fragments (microplastics), leading to injury, starvation, and death. Recycling ensures that plastic waste is properly managed and prevents it from polluting natural habitats.\n3.  **Toxic Fumes from Incineration:** When plastics are burned as a method of disposal (incineration), they can release harmful substances into the atmosphere. For example, the combustion of plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce toxic gases such as hydrogen chloride (which contributes to acid rain) and dioxins (which are highly carcinogenic). Recycling is an alternative to incineration that avoids the production of these airborne pollutants.\n\nSince all three statements describe significant negative impacts of plastic disposal that are mitigated by recycling, they are all correct explanations.

Initially, when oxygen is plentiful, aerobic decomposition occurs, producing carbon dioxide. However, as the vegetation is packed in the bin, the oxygen supply becomes limited, especially in the centre of the pile. This creates anaerobic (oxygen-deficient) conditions.\n\nUnder anaerobic conditions, a different set of microorganisms, known as methanogens, thrive. These microorganisms carry out anaerobic decomposition (or anaerobic respiration), breaking down the organic matter without oxygen. A primary product of this process is methane gas (CH\u2084). Since the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is very low (less than 0.0002%), the methane produced inside the bin will result in a significantly higher percentage than in the air outside.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A - carbon monoxide:**\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. It is not a significant product of the biological decomposition of organic matter in a compost bin. Therefore, its concentration is not expected to be higher inside the bin.\n\n**C - oxygen:**\nOxygen is consumed by aerobic microorganisms during the decomposition process. As these organisms break down the vegetation, they use up the oxygen available within the bin for respiration. This leads to a decrease in the oxygen concentration inside the bin, making it lower than the oxygen concentration in the outside air (which is approximately 21%).\n\n**D - sulfur dioxide:**\nSulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) is primarily formed from the combustion of fossil fuels containing sulfur impurities and from volcanic activity. While decomposition of sulfur-containing compounds in vegetation can produce small amounts of smelly gases like hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S), it does not produce significant quantities of sulfur dioxide.

Under conditions of high temperature (e.g., 300 \u00b0C), high pressure (e.g., 60-70 atm), and a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst, the double bond in the ethene molecule (C\u2082H\u2084) breaks. A water molecule (H\u2082O) adds across the double bond, with a hydrogen atom adding to one carbon and a hydroxyl (-OH) group adding to the other. This process forms ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH).\n\nThe reaction of ethene with bromine (Br\u2082) is also an addition reaction, specifically halogenation. The double bond in ethene breaks, and one bromine atom from the Br\u2082 molecule adds to each of the two carbon atoms. This results in the formation of 1,2-dibromoethane (C\u2082H\u2084Br\u2082).\n\nTherefore, the products of the two separate reactions are ethanol and dibromoethane.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: ethanoic acid and bromoethane**\nThis is incorrect. The hydration of ethene produces ethanol, not ethanoic acid. Ethanoic acid is a carboxylic acid and can be formed by the oxidation of ethanol, but it is not the direct product of the reaction between ethene and steam. Furthermore, the reaction of ethene with bromine (Br\u2082) results in dibromoethane, as two bromine atoms add across the double bond. Bromoethane would be formed if ethene reacted with hydrogen bromide (HBr), not bromine.\n\n**B: ethanoic acid and dibromoethane**\nThis is incorrect. While the reaction of ethene with bromine correctly produces dibromoethane, the reaction of ethene with steam produces ethanol. Ethanoic acid is not formed in this reaction; its formation would require a subsequent oxidation step of the primary product, ethanol.\n\n**C: ethanol and bromoethane**\nThis is incorrect. Although the reaction of ethene with steam correctly produces ethanol, the reaction with bromine (Br\u2082) yields 1,2-dibromoethane.

Saturated hydrocarbons are characterised by having only single carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) covalent bonds.\n\n1.  **Substitution:** Alkanes are relatively unreactive but undergo substitution reactions, typically with halogens in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom in the ethane molecule is replaced by a halogen atom. For example:\n    C\u2082H\u2086 + Cl\u2082 --(UV light)--> C\u2082H\u2085Cl + HCl\n    Therefore, ethane undergoes substitution.\n\n2.  **Combustion:** Alkanes are excellent fuels and undergo combustion (burning) in the presence of oxygen.

Polymerisation, specifically addition polymerisation, is a reaction where many small, unsaturated molecules (monomers) join together to form a very large molecule (a polymer). This process requires the monomer to have a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Ethane is a saturated molecule with only single C-C bonds and thus cannot act as a monomer in an addition polymerisation reaction.\n\n#### C: 2 and 4\n\nThis option is incorrect because ethane does not undergo addition reactions. Addition reactions are characteristic of unsaturated compounds (like alkenes and alkynes) that contain at least one carbon-carbon double or triple bond. In an addition reaction, the double or triple bond breaks, allowing atoms to be added to the carbon atoms. As ethane is saturated and lacks any double or triple bonds, it cannot undergo addition reactions.\n\n#### D: 3 and 4\n\nThis option is incorrect because ethane undergoes neither polymerisation nor addition reactions.

This process separates the hydrocarbons based on their different boiling points.\n\n*   **Stage 2: Cracking**\n    Fuel oil contains long-chain alkane molecules, which are in lower demand than shorter-chain hydrocarbons. Ethene is a small, highly useful alkene. The process of breaking down large, long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller, more useful ones (like alkenes and shorter-chain alkanes) is called cracking. This is achieved by heating the long-chain hydrocarbons to a high temperature, with or without a catalyst.\n\n*   **Stage 3: Polymerisation**\n    Ethene is a monomer, a small molecule that can join with other identical molecules to form a polymer. Poly(ethene) is a long-chain polymer.

Therefore, statement 4, \"Particles vibrate about fixed points,\" is also correct.\n\nThe combination of these two statements (1 and 4) provides a complete description of the particles in a pure solid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because while statement 1 (regular arrangement) correctly describes solids, statement 3 (\"Particles move over each other\") does not. The ability of particles to slide or move over one another is a characteristic feature of liquids, which allows them to flow. In solids, particles are held in fixed positions by strong intermolecular forces and can only vibrate.\n\n**C: 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because both statements describe the properties of a liquid, not a solid. Statement 2 (\"Particles are randomly arranged\") and statement 3 (\"Particles move over each other\") accurately depict the disordered structure and fluid nature of the liquid state, where particles are close together but not in fixed positions.\n\n**D: 2 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because while statement 4 (vibration about fixed points) correctly describes the motion of particles in a solid, statement 2 (\"Particles are randomly arranged\") is incorrect. A random or disordered arrangement of particles is characteristic of liquids and gases. Solids are defined by their ordered and regular particle arrangement (a crystal lattice)."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_443.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "3 one atom of an element contains 12 electrons, 12 protons and 13 neutrons.\nhow many nucleons does this atom contain?\na 12 b 13 c 24 d 25", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe number of nucleons, also known as the nucleon number or mass number (A), represents the total count of particles within the atomic nucleus.

Atoms of Group II elements have two valence electrons, which they lose to form a positive ion with a charge of 2+, represented as X\u00b2\u207a.\nDilute sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) is a typical acid. When a reactive metal reacts with a dilute acid, the products are a salt and hydrogen gas. The salt is an ionic compound formed from the metal cation (X\u00b2\u207a) and the anion from the acid, which is the sulfate ion (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b). To form a neutral salt, one X\u00b2\u207a ion combines with one SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ion. Therefore, the chemical formula of the salt is XSO\u2084. The other product is hydrogen gas (H\u2082).\nThe balanced chemical equation is: X + H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 XSO\u2084 + H\u2082.\n\n**Reaction with oxygen:**\nWhen a metal reacts with oxygen, a metal oxide is formed. The metal X forms the X\u00b2\u207a ion. Oxygen, in a simple oxide, forms the oxide ion (O\u00b2\u207b). To form a neutral compound, one X\u00b2\u207a ion will combine with one O\u00b2\u207b ion. This results in the chemical formula XO.\nThe balanced chemical equation is: 2X + O\u2082 \u2192 2XO.\n\nTherefore, the products of the reaction with dilute sulfuric acid are XSO\u2084 and H\u2082, and the product of the reaction with oxygen is XO.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n**B.

However, the product of the reaction with oxygen is incorrect. Group II metals form X\u00b2\u207a ions. The product XO\u2082 would imply the formation of a peroxide (containing the O\u2082\u00b2\u207b ion) or a dioxide. While some heavier Group II metals can form peroxides under specific conditions, the simple oxide (XO), formed from X\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b ions, is the most common and expected product.\n\n**C. X\u2082SO\u2084 and H\u2082 | XO**\nThe product of the reaction with oxygen (XO) is correctly identified. However, the formula for the salt formed with sulfuric acid is incorrect. A metal X in Group II forms an ion with a 2+ charge (X\u00b2\u207a). The sulfate ion has a 2- charge (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b). To form a neutral salt, these ions combine in a 1:1 ratio, giving the formula XSO\u2084. The formula X\u2082SO\u2084 would imply that the metal ion has a 1+ charge (X\u207a), which is characteristic of Group I metals, not Group II.\n\n**D.

Nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule (N\u2082) in this reaction, so its Mr of 28 must be used.\n\n**B: 25.5 tonnes**\nThis answer is incorrect. It results from mistakenly dividing the mass of ammonia by 2 (51 / 2 = 25.5), likely due to misinterpreting the stoichiometric coefficient '2' in front of NH\u2083 as a direct mass ratio. Stoichiometric calculations must be based on mole ratios converted to mass, not on direct coefficient-to-mass ratios.\n\n**D: 84 tonnes**\nThis answer is incorrect. It arises from an error in applying the mole ratio.

The key principles are as follows:\n\n1.  **Negative Electrode (Cathode):** The object to be plated is always made the cathode. It is connected to the negative terminal of the power supply. At the cathode, reduction occurs. Positively charged metal ions from the electrolyte are attracted to the negative electrode, gain electrons, and are deposited as a thin metal layer. In this case, the nickel shape is being plated, so it is the negative electrode.\n\n2.  **Positive Electrode (Anode):** The anode is made of the metal that will form the coating. It is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply. At the anode, oxidation occurs. The metal atoms of the anode lose electrons and dissolve into the electrolyte as positive ions. This process replenishes the metal ions that are being deposited at the cathode. Here, the nickel shape is being plated with silver, so the positive electrode must be a silver rod.\n\n3.  **Electrolyte:** The electrolyte must be a solution containing ions of the plating metal. It serves to conduct electricity and provide a source of metal ions to be deposited. Since the plating metal is silver, the electrolyte must contain silver ions (Ag\u207a).

This absorption of energy results in the products having a higher total potential energy than the reactants. The reaction pathway diagram for an endothermic reaction must therefore show the final energy level (products) as higher than the initial energy level (reactants). This diagram correctly illustrates this principle, with the energy of the reactants at a lower level on the y-axis and the energy of the products at a higher level, indicating a net input of energy into the system. The difference in energy levels represents a positive enthalpy change (\u0394H > 0).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This diagram represents an exothermic reaction, not an endothermic one. In an exothermic reaction, energy is released into the surroundings. This means the products have a lower potential energy than the reactants. The diagram shows the energy level of the reactants starting high and ending at a lower level for the products, which signifies a net release of energy and a negative enthalpy change (\u0394H < 0).\n\n**C:** This diagram is incorrectly constructed for representing a chemical reaction. A reaction pathway diagram shows the change in energy as a reaction progresses from reactants to products. In this diagram, the \"products\" are shown at the beginning of the reaction's progress, and the \"reactants\" are at the end. This reverses the standard convention and does not correctly depict the course of a chemical reaction. Therefore, it cannot accurately represent any type of reaction.\n\n**D:** This diagram shows the energy level of the reactants and the products as being equal. This indicates that there is no net energy change during the reaction, meaning the enthalpy change (\u0394H) is zero. An endothermic reaction, by definition, involves a net absorption of energy, resulting in a positive enthalpy change.

Combustion reactions are a classic example of **exothermic reactions**. An exothermic reaction is a chemical process that releases energy into the surroundings, typically in the form of heat and light. When a match burns, a flame is produced, which is tangible evidence of energy being released. Therefore, the statement that the reaction is exothermic because energy is given out as the match burns accurately describes the process.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A: endothermic, because energy is given out as the match burns**\n    This option is incorrect because it contains a contradiction. An **endothermic** reaction is one that absorbs energy from the surroundings, leading to a decrease in the temperature of the surroundings. The reason provided, \"energy is given out,\" describes an **exothermic** reaction. Since burning a match clearly releases heat and light, it cannot be endothermic.\n\n*   **B: endothermic, because energy is used to strike the match**\n    This option is incorrect because the reaction is exothermic, not endothermic. While it is true that energy is required to initiate the reaction (the energy from friction when striking the match), this initial energy input is known as the **activation energy**. The activation energy does not determine whether the overall reaction is endothermic or exothermic. The overall classification depends on the net energy change. In this case, the amount of energy released by the combustion is far greater than the activation energy supplied, making the reaction exothermic.\n\n*   **D: exothermic, because energy is used to strike the match**\n    This option correctly identifies the reaction as exothermic but provides an incorrect reason. The energy used to strike the match is the activation energy, which is the minimum energy required to start the reaction. A reaction is defined as exothermic not because it requires an initial input of energy, but because the total energy of the products is lower than the total energy of the reactants, resulting in a net release of energy to the surroundings. The correct reason for the reaction being exothermic is that energy is given out as the match burns."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_454.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "14 hydrogen peroxide decomposes to form water and oxygen. the equation is shown.\n2h20,(l) + 2h2o0(i) + o2(g)\nmanganese(iv) oxide catalyses this reaction.\nwhich statements about manganese(iv) oxide are correct?\n1 it increases the rate of the reaction.\n2 itincreases the total volume of oxygen gas produced at the end of the reaction.\n3 it will have the same mass at the end of the reaction as it does at the start of the\nreaction.\na 1,2and3 b 1dand2only c t1and3only d = 2and3only", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation\n\nA catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being chemically consumed in the process.

Gently warming the acid increases the kinetic energy of the acid particles, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions with the metal oxide particles. This increases the rate of the neutralization reaction.\n2.  **Step 3: Add excess metal oxide.** The metal oxide is added in excess to ensure that all of the acid is completely reacted. If the acid were in excess, the final salt solution would be contaminated with unreacted acid, which is difficult to separate from the salt. Since the metal oxide is an insoluble solid, any unreacted excess can be easily removed in the next step.\n3.  **Step 4: Filter to remove any unreacted solid.** After the reaction is complete, the mixture contains the dissolved soluble salt and the unreacted solid metal oxide. Filtration is used to separate the insoluble solid (the excess metal oxide) from the liquid filtrate (the aqueous salt solution). This leaves a pure solution of the salt.\n4.  **Step 2: Evaporate the solution to half of its volume and allow to cool.** This is the process of crystallization. The pure salt solution is heated to evaporate some of the water, creating a more concentrated, saturated solution. As this hot, saturated solution cools, the solubility of the salt decreases, causing the dissolved salt to form solid crystals.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4**\n    This sequence is incorrect because it involves concentrating the acid by evaporation (Step 2) before the reaction has taken place. More significantly, it places the crystallization step (2) before the filtration step (4). Attempting to crystallize the salt while the excess unreacted solid is still present would result in an impure product, with crystals forming amongst the unreacted metal oxide.\n\n*   **C: 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4**\n    This sequence is incorrect because the filtration step (4) is performed after the crystallization step (2). The primary purpose of filtration in this method is to remove the excess solid reactant *before* isolating the salt product. Filtering after crystallization would mean the solid salt crystals are mixed with the unreacted metal oxide, making separation impossible at this stage.\n\n*   **D: 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 1 \u2192 2**\n    This sequence is chemically illogical. It suggests adding the metal oxide (Step 3) and then immediately filtering it out (Step 4) before a significant reaction can occur.

This is because as you go down the group, the atoms have more electron shells. The outermost electron is further from the positive nucleus and is subject to more shielding by the inner electron shells. This weakens the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron, making it easier to lose. Therefore, potassium (K) is more reactive than lithium (Li).\n\n*   **Reactivity of Halogens:** Reactivity decreases down Group 17. As you go down the group, the atoms also get larger with more electron shells. The outermost shell is further from the nucleus, and there is more shielding. This weakens the nucleus's ability to attract and capture an electron from another atom. Therefore, chlorine (Cl) is more reactive than iodine (I).\n\nThe most violent reaction will occur between the most reactive alkali metal and the most reactive halogen.

While chlorine is a highly reactive halogen, lithium is less reactive than potassium. The reactivity of alkali metals increases down the group because the valence electron is more easily lost. Since potassium loses its electron more readily than lithium, its reaction with chlorine is more vigorous.\n\n**C. iodine and lithium**\nThis reaction would be the least violent of the four options.

This low reactivity dictates its behaviour in the given tests.\n\n1.  **Reaction with Cold Water/Steam:** A metal must be more reactive than hydrogen to displace it from water (H\u2082O), either cold or as steam. Since silver is less reactive than hydrogen, it cannot displace hydrogen from water molecules. Therefore, silver does not react with cold water or with steam.\n2.  **Reaction with Dilute Hydrochloric Acid:** For a metal to react with a dilute non-oxidising acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl), it must be more reactive than hydrogen to displace the hydrogen ions (H\u207a) from the solution as hydrogen gas. As silver is below hydrogen in the reactivity series, it is not reactive enough to do this.

Carbon dioxide is reduced by coke to carbon monoxide.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes one of the key chemical reactions inside the blast furnace. In the hotter regions of the furnace (around 1000\u00b0C), the carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) produced from the combustion of coke reacts with more hot coke (which is primarily carbon, C). In this reaction, carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide (CO), and the carbon is oxidised. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\nCO\u2082(g) + C(s) \u2192 2CO(g)\nThis reaction is crucial because it regenerates carbon monoxide, which is the main reducing agent responsible for reducing the iron ore (hematite) to iron.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Air is blown into the blast furnace to oxidise the molten iron.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Hot air is blown into the blast furnace to provide oxygen for the combustion of coke (carbon). This highly exothermic reaction (C + O\u2082 \u2192 CO\u2082) generates the intense heat required to maintain the high temperatures within the furnace. The goal of the process is to *reduce* iron oxide to iron, not to *oxidise* the iron product. Oxidising the molten iron would convert it back into iron oxide, which would be counterproductive.\n\n**C. Hematite is oxidised by carbon to molten iron.**\n\nThis statement contains a fundamental error in the description of the chemical process. Hematite, which is iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), is converted to iron (Fe). This conversion involves the removal of oxygen from the iron oxide. The removal of oxygen is defined as **reduction**, not oxidation. Therefore, hematite is **reduced** to form molten iron. The main reducing agent is carbon monoxide (CO), as shown in the equation: Fe\u2082O\u2083 + 3CO \u2192 2Fe + 3CO\u2082.\n\n**D. The slag produced is denser than molten iron.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Slag is formed when limestone (calcium carbonate), added as a flux, decomposes to calcium oxide (CaO). This calcium oxide then reacts with acidic impurities in the iron ore, such as silicon dioxide (SiO\u2082), to form molten calcium silicate (CaSiO\u2083), which is the slag. A crucial property of this slag is that it is **less dense** than molten iron. This lower density causes it to float on top of the molten iron at the bottom of the furnace. This allows the slag and iron to be tapped off separately and also protects the molten iron from re-oxidation by the hot air blasts."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_469.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "29 what is an alloy?\na acompound of two metallic elements\nb  acompound of metallic and non-metallic elements\nc  amixture of a metal and at least one other element\nd  apure metallic element", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nAn alloy is correctly defined as a mixture that contains a metal as its main component, combined with at least one other element. This other element can be another metal or a non-metal. Alloys are not chemical compounds; the constituent elements are physically mixed, usually by melting them together and allowing them to cool and solidify. This process results in a material with different, often enhanced, physical properties (such as increased hardness, strength, or resistance to corrosion) compared to the pure metal. For example, steel is an alloy of iron (a metal) and carbon (a non-metal), and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc (both metals).\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** An alloy is a mixture, not a compound.

The overall reaction consumes gaseous oxygen.\n\n*   **In tube S**, the unpainted iron nail is exposed to both water and the trapped air (which contains oxygen). These are the necessary conditions for rusting to occur. As the iron rusts, it reacts with and consumes the oxygen gas present in the air trapped inside the tube. The consumption of a gas leads to a decrease in the pressure inside tube S. Consequently, the higher atmospheric pressure outside the tube pushes the water up into the tube until the pressure inside and outside are balanced. Therefore, the water level in tube S rises.\n\n*   **In tube T**, the iron nail is coated with paint. The paint acts as a protective barrier, preventing the iron from coming into direct contact with the oxygen and water. Since the iron is not exposed to these reactants, rusting does not occur. As there is no chemical reaction consuming the trapped air, the volume and pressure of the gas inside tube T remain constant. Therefore, the water level in tube T shows no change.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: falls, rises**\nThis is incorrect. In tube S, the consumption of oxygen during rusting causes a decrease in gas pressure, leading to a rise, not a fall, in the water level. In tube T, rusting is prevented by the paint, so there is no consumption of oxygen and thus no change in water level, not a rise.\n\n**B: no change, rises**\nThis is incorrect. In tube S, rusting occurs and consumes oxygen, causing the water level to rise, not remain unchanged. In tube T, rusting is prevented, so the water level remains unchanged, it does not rise. A rise in tube T would imply that rusting was occurring despite the paint.\n\n**C: rises, falls**\nThis is incorrect. While the prediction for tube S is correct (the water level rises), the prediction for tube T is wrong.

It consists of a vast number of different hydrocarbon compounds with varying chain lengths and structures. These compounds are not chemically bonded to each other but are physically intermingled. Because it is a mixture, its composition is not fixed and can vary depending on its source.\n\nThe method used to separate this mixture into its useful components (called fractions) is **fractional distillation**. This physical separation process works by exploiting the differences in the boiling points of the various hydrocarbon compounds. The crude oil is heated, causing the hydrocarbons to vaporize. The hot vapour mixture rises through a fractionating column, which is cooler at the top and hotter at the bottom. Hydrocarbons with higher boiling points (longer chains) condense at lower, hotter levels in the column, while hydrocarbons with lower boiling points (shorter chains) continue to rise to higher, cooler levels before condensing. This allows the different fractions, such as petrol, kerosene, and diesel, to be collected at different heights.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: compound, cracking**\nThis is incorrect. Petroleum is not a single compound; it is a complex mixture of many different hydrocarbon compounds. Furthermore, cracking is not a separation method. Cracking is a chemical process that breaks down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more useful ones; it does not separate the initial mixture.\n\n**B: compound, fractional distillation**\nThis is incorrect because petroleum is a mixture, not a compound. A compound consists of two or more elements chemically bonded in a fixed ratio and cannot be separated by physical means like distillation. While fractional distillation is the correct method, the description of petroleum as a compound is wrong.\n\n**C: mixture, cracking**\nThis is incorrect because although petroleum is correctly identified as a mixture, cracking is not the method used to separate it. Fractional distillation is the physical process used for the initial separation of crude oil into its fractions.

Both ethane and propane fit this definition. Furthermore, members of a homologous series differ from the next by a CH\u2082 group, which is the case for propane relative to ethane. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nSince both statements 1 and 4 are correct, this option is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### **Why A is an incorrect answer**\n\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false.\n\n*   **Statement 1** is correct. All carboxylic acids belong to the same homologous series and share the -COOH functional group, giving them similar chemical properties.\n*   **Statement 3: \"Ethane and ethene are members of the same homologous series.\"** This statement is incorrect. Ethane (C\u2082H\u2086) is an alkane, characterized by single carbon-carbon bonds and the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082. Ethene (C\u2082H\u2084) is an alkene, characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099. Since they have different functional groups and different general formulas, they belong to two different homologous series (alkanes and alkenes).\n\nBecause statement 3 is incorrect, this combination is not the correct answer.\n\n---\n### **Why C is an incorrect answer**\n\nThis option is incorrect because both statements 2 and 3 are false.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"All alcohols have the same molecular mass.\"** This statement is incorrect. A key feature of a homologous series is that successive members differ by a CH\u2082 group. This means that as the carbon chain length increases, the relative molecular mass also increases. For example, methanol (CH\u2083OH) has a relative molecular mass of 32, while ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) has a relative molecular mass of 46.\n\n*   **Statement 3: \"Ethane and ethene are members of the same homologous series.\"** This statement is incorrect. Ethane is an alkane (C\u2082H\u2086) and ethene is an alkene (C\u2082H\u2084). They belong to different homologous series because they have different functional groups (C-C single bond vs. C=C double bond) and different general formulas.\n\nSince both statements are incorrect, this option is not the correct answer.\n\n---\n### **Why D is an incorrect answer**\n\nThis option is incorrect because statement 2 is false.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"All alcohols have the same molecular mass.\"** This statement is incorrect. Members of a homologous series, such as alcohols, have different molecular masses. Each subsequent member in the series has an additional CH\u2082 unit, which increases its relative molecular mass by 14. For instance, ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) has a greater molecular mass than methanol (CH\u2083OH).\n\n*   **Statement 4** is correct. Ethane (C\u2082H\u2086) and propane (C\u2083H\u2088) are both members of the alkane homologous series, as they share the same general formula (C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082) and have similar chemical properties.\n\nHowever, since a correct option must contain only true statements, and statement 2 is false, this combination is not the correct answer."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_476.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "36 the formulae of two organic compounds, p and q, are shown.\np q\nch3ch2ch20h ch3ch=chch3\nwhich type of organic compounds are p and q?\na alcohol alkane\nb alcohol alkene\ncc carboxylic acid alkane\nd carboxylic acid alkene", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Compound P (CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082OH):** This compound belongs to the **alcohol** homologous series.

Fermentation is a biological process where microorganisms, typically yeast, convert carbohydrates (such as sugars and starches found in crops like corn, sugarcane, or wheat) into ethanol and carbon dioxide in an anaerobic environment (without oxygen). The resulting ethanol is then purified by distillation and can be used as a fuel, either on its own or blended with gasoline.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. diesel:**\nDiesel is a fossil fuel produced from the fractional distillation of crude oil. Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that is heated and separated into different fractions based on their boiling points in a fractionating column. Diesel is one of these fractions, consisting of hydrocarbons typically containing 12 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule. This is a physical separation process, not a biological process like fermentation.\n\n**C. hydrogen:**\nHydrogen fuel is primarily manufactured through industrial processes such as steam-methane reforming (reacting natural gas with steam at high temperatures) or the electrolysis of water (using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen). These are chemical and electrochemical processes, respectively, and do not involve fermentation.\n\n**D. kerosene:**\nKerosene is another fraction obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil.

Due to their durability and non-biodegradable nature, these plastics persist in the marine environment for extremely long periods. They break down into smaller fragments known as microplastics but do not decompose chemically. This accumulation of plastic debris poses a significant threat to aquatic life. Marine animals can mistake plastic items for food, leading to internal blockages, malnutrition, and death. They can also become entangled in larger plastic waste, causing injury, suffocation, or drowning.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This statement is incorrect because plastics are non-biodegradable. This means that microorganisms cannot break them down. When placed in landfill sites, plastics remain intact for hundreds or even thousands of years, taking up valuable space and contributing to long-term land pollution. They do not decompose quickly.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect because burning plastics (incineration) often produces toxic gases. Many plastics, when combusted, release harmful pollutants. For example, the combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce toxic hydrogen chloride gas, and incomplete combustion of any plastic can produce poisonous carbon monoxide. The burning of plastics can also release other hazardous substances like dioxins, which are harmful to health and the environment.\n\n**D:** This statement is incorrect because plastics are generally insoluble in water. This insolubility is a key property that makes them useful for applications like bottles, containers, and packaging. Since they do not dissolve in water, they cannot be disposed of by this method.

In this structure, each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms by strong covalent bonds. These atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating, three-dimensional tetrahedral lattice. This network of strong covalent bonds extends throughout the entire crystal, making diamond an extremely hard and rigid substance with a very high melting point. Due to its exceptional hardness, which is the highest of any natural material, diamond is used in industrial applications for cutting, drilling, and grinding hard materials. Therefore, its use **in cutting tools** is a direct consequence of its giant covalent structure.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A: ionic, in cutting tools**\n    This option is incorrect because diamond does not have an ionic structure. Ionic bonding involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, typically formed by the transfer of electrons between a metal and a non-metal. Diamond is an element composed solely of carbon atoms (a non-metal), which share electrons to form strong covalent bonds.\n\n*   **B: ionic, as a lubricant**\n    This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, diamond has a giant covalent structure, not an ionic one. Secondly, diamond is not used as a lubricant. Its rigid, interlocking three-dimensional lattice makes it extremely hard and abrasive. The allotrope of carbon used as a solid lubricant is graphite, which has a layered structure allowing the layers to slide over one another.\n\n*   **D: giant covalent, as a lubricant**\n    While this option correctly identifies the structure of diamond as **giant covalent**, it incorrectly states its use. The rigid, three-dimensional network of strong covalent bonds in diamond results in extreme hardness, not the slippery property required for a lubricant.

These can be either delocalised electrons (as in metals) or mobile ions (as in molten ionic compounds or aqueous solutions of ionic compounds).\n\n1.  **Solid copper:** Copper is a metal. Metals have a giant metallic lattice structure consisting of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not fixed to any single atom and are free to move throughout the structure. When a potential difference (voltage) is applied, these mobile electrons flow and carry an electric current. Therefore, solid copper conducts electricity.\n\n2.  **Aqueous sodium bromide:** Sodium bromide is an ionic compound. In its solid state, the ions (Na\u207a and Br\u207b) are held in fixed positions within a crystal lattice and cannot move, so solid sodium bromide does not conduct electricity. However, when dissolved in water (aqueous solution), the ionic lattice breaks down, and the ions are free to move throughout the solution. These mobile ions act as charge carriers, allowing the solution to conduct electricity.\n\n3.  **Solid lead(II) bromide:** Lead(II) bromide is an ionic compound. In the solid state, its ions (Pb\u00b2\u207a and Br\u207b) are held rigidly in a giant ionic lattice. Since the ions are not free to move, there are no mobile charge carriers. Consequently, solid lead(II) bromide does not conduct electricity. It would only conduct electricity if it were melted (molten), which would free the ions to move.\n\nBased on this analysis, solid copper and aqueous sodium bromide conduct electricity, while solid lead(II) bromide does not.

Therefore, this process produces hydrogen.\n\n2.  **The electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid:** This process is effectively the electrolysis of water, as the sulfuric acid serves as an electrolyte to allow for the conduction of electricity. During electrolysis, water (H\u2082O) is decomposed into its constituent elements. Hydrogen gas is produced at the negative electrode (cathode), and oxygen gas is produced at the positive electrode (anode). The overall equation is 2H\u2082O(l) \u2192 2H\u2082(g) + O\u2082(g). Therefore, this process also produces hydrogen.\n\nSince both processes 1 and 2 produce hydrogen, this combination is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: 1 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because while the cracking of hydrocarbons (1) produces hydrogen, the electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide (4) does not. The electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide (the Hall-H\u00e9roult process) is used to extract aluminium metal.

Hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode during the electrolysis of *aqueous solutions* containing water, especially when the metal cation is more reactive than hydrogen (like sodium).

The anode is the site of oxidation, where anions lose electrons. Furthermore, as explained for option C, the term \"molten\" indicates the absence of water.

To measure this, two quantities are required: a measure of the reaction's progress (e.g., volume of product formed) and the time taken for that change to occur.\n\nIn a reaction that produces a gas, the volume of gas evolved is a direct measure of the amount of product formed. A **gas syringe** is a piece of laboratory apparatus specifically designed to collect and measure the volume of gas produced over the course of a reaction. To determine the rate, these volume measurements must be taken at specific time intervals. A **stop-watch** is used to accurately measure this time.

A higher concentration of OH\u207b ions results in a more alkaline solution, which corresponds to a higher pH value. Universal indicator is used to estimate the pH of a solution by changing colour. In alkaline solutions (pH > 7), universal indicator turns blue and then violet/purple as the alkalinity increases. Among the given options, the colour blue represents the highest pH value and therefore the most alkaline solution. Consequently, the solution that turns blue has the greatest concentration of hydroxide ions.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. red**\nThis is incorrect. A red colour with universal indicator signifies a strongly acidic solution, which has a very low pH (approximately 1-3). Acidic solutions are characterised by a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and a very low concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\u207b).\n\n**B. yellow**\nThis is incorrect. A yellow colour with universal indicator indicates a weakly acidic solution with a pH value slightly below 7 (approximately 5-6).

A green colour with universal indicator corresponds to a neutral solution, which has a pH of exactly 7.

Because of this systematic arrangement, the position of an element in the table (its group and period) provides significant information about its physical and chemical properties. For instance, elements within the same group have similar chemical behaviours because they possess the same number of valence electrons. Trends such as atomic radius, electronegativity, and metallic character can be predicted both down a group and across a period. Therefore, the Periodic Table serves as a fundamental predictive tool in chemistry.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. All the metals in the Periodic Table are transition elements.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While transition elements (found in the central block of the table, typically Groups 3-12) are metals, they are not the only type. Other major groups of metals include the alkali metals (Group I), the alkaline earth metals (Group II), and post-transition metals like aluminium, tin, and lead.

The elements become more metallic across a period from Group I to Group VII.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Metallic character refers to the tendency of an element to lose its valence electrons. Across a period from left to right (e.g., from Group I to Group VII), the nuclear charge increases while electrons are added to the same energy shell. This stronger attraction pulls the valence electrons closer to the nucleus, making them more difficult to lose. Consequently, metallic character **decreases** across a period.

Therefore, an element that is a dark solid at room temperature and exists as a diatomic molecule aligns perfectly with the properties of iodine, which is in Group VII.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Group I**\n\nElements in Group I are the alkali metals. While they are solids at room temperature (with the exception of caesium and francium, which have very low melting points), they are typically silvery-white metals, not dark solids. More importantly, metals exist in a metallic lattice structure and are represented by their atomic symbols (e.g., Na, K); they do not form diatomic molecules in their elemental state.\n\n**C. Group VIII**\n\nElements in Group VIII are the noble gases. Their defining characteristic is a full outer shell of electrons, which makes them chemically inert and stable. Consequently, they exist as individual, monatomic atoms (e.g., Ne, Ar), not as diatomic molecules. Additionally, all noble gases are colourless gases at room temperature, which contradicts the property of being a dark solid.\n\n**D. transition elements**\n\nThe transition elements are metals located in the central block of the Periodic Table. Like other metals, they exist in a metallic lattice structure and do not form diatomic molecules in their elemental form. While most are solids at room temperature, their fundamental structure is not diatomic, which is a key property of element R."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_510.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 four metals, w, x, y and z, are tested with either cold water, steam or both.\nthe observations are shown.\nwww reacts slowly with cold water\nx reacts rapidly with cold water\n\u00a5 does not react with cold water but reacts with steam\nz does not react with cold water or steam\nwhat is the order of reactivity of the metals from the least reactive to the most reactive?\nleast most\nreactive reactive\na ww xx y zz\nb ww y x z\ncc z y x ww\nd z y\u00a5 ww xx", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\nThe reactivity of metals with water provides a clear indication of their position in the reactivity series.

It does not react with either cold water or steam, placing it at the bottom of the reactivity order among these four metals.\n2.  **Metal Y** is more reactive than Z. It does not react with cold water but does react with steam. This indicates it is reactive enough to react with water, but only at the higher temperature of steam.\n3.  **Metals W and X** are more reactive than Y because they both react with cold water. To determine their relative reactivity, we compare the rates of their reactions.\n4.  **Metal X** is more reactive than Metal W. Metal X reacts *rapidly* with cold water, whereas Metal W reacts *slowly*. A faster reaction rate indicates greater reactivity. Therefore, X is the most reactive metal in this group.\n\nCombining these points, the order of reactivity from least reactive to most reactive is Z < Y < W < X.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A: W, X, Y, Z**\n    This order is incorrect. It suggests that W is the least reactive and Z is the most reactive. In fact, Z is the least reactive as it does not react at all, while W is quite reactive as it reacts with cold water.\n\n*   **B: W, Y, X, Z**\n    This option incorrectly places W as the least reactive and Z as the most reactive. Metal Z is the least reactive because it fails to react with both cold water and steam. Metal W, which reacts with cold water, is significantly more reactive than both Z and Y.\n\n*   **C: Z, Y, X, W**\n    This option correctly identifies Z as the least reactive and Y as the next in reactivity.

In a displacement reaction, a more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halide ion from its aqueous salt solution.\n\nIn this option, chlorine (Cl\u2082) is reacted with aqueous sodium bromide (NaBr). Chlorine is higher in Group 17 than bromine, making it more reactive. Therefore, chlorine is able to displace bromine from the sodium bromide solution. The chlorine atoms gain electrons (are reduced) to form chloride ions (Cl\u207b), and the bromide ions (Br\u207b) lose electrons (are oxidised) to form bromine molecules (Br\u2082).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\nCl\u2082(aq) + 2NaBr(aq) \u2192 2NaCl(aq) + Br\u2082(aq)\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Iodine displaces bromine from aqueous sodium bromide.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Iodine (I\u2082) is below bromine (Br\u2082) in Group 17 and is therefore less reactive. A less reactive halogen cannot displace a more reactive halide ion from its salt solution. Consequently, no reaction will occur when iodine is added to aqueous sodium bromide.\n\n**B. Bromine displaces chlorine from aqueous potassium chloride.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bromine (Br\u2082) is less reactive than chlorine (Cl\u2082) because it is lower down in Group 17. Therefore, bromine cannot displace the more reactive chloride ions from the aqueous potassium chloride solution.\n\n**C. Iodine displaces chlorine from aqueous potassium chloride.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Iodine (I\u2082) is significantly less reactive than chlorine (Cl\u2082) as it is two periods below chlorine in Group 17.

For instance, iron is a vital component of haemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport in the blood of many fish and invertebrates. Other metals like zinc, copper, and manganese function as cofactors for enzymes, which are crucial for metabolic processes. Therefore, the presence of these metal compounds in low, non-toxic concentrations is beneficial for the health and survival of aquatic life.\n\n2.  **Dissolved Oxygen:** Dissolved oxygen (O\u2082) is fundamental for the survival of almost all aquatic animals. Fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and many other organisms use gills or other specialised respiratory surfaces to extract dissolved oxygen from the water. This oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, the cellular process that releases energy from food. A sufficient concentration of dissolved oxygen is a primary indicator of good water quality and is essential for a healthy aquatic ecosystem.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A (1 and 2):** This option is incorrect because it includes plastics. Plastics are synthetic, non-biodegradable pollutants. They are not from natural sources in the same way as minerals and are harmful to aquatic animals. Animals can become entangled in larger plastic debris, or they can ingest microplastics, leading to internal injury, blockages of the digestive tract, and exposure to toxic chemicals.\n\n**C (2 and 3):** This option is incorrect because it includes both plastics and phosphates, which are generally detrimental to aquatic animals. As explained above, plastics are harmful pollutants. While phosphates are nutrients, their effect on animal life is often negative. High phosphate levels lead to eutrophication, a process that ultimately depletes the water of dissolved oxygen, causing widespread death of aquatic animals.\n\n**D (3 and 4):** This option is incorrect because it lists phosphates as beneficial. Phosphates are essential nutrients for aquatic plants and algae, not directly for most aquatic animals. While they support the base of the food web, an excess of phosphates from sources like agricultural runoff or sewage causes eutrophication. This results in an explosive growth of algae (an algal bloom). When these algae die, their decomposition by bacteria consumes vast amounts of dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) conditions that are lethal to fish and other aquatic animals. Therefore, phosphates are typically considered pollutants in the context of animal health."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_513.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "33. what are the products formed when glucose is fermented?\na_ ethanol and carbon dioxide\nb_ ethanol and oxygen\nc_ ethene and carbon dioxide\nd_ ethene and oxygen", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAlcoholic fermentation is a biochemical process in which glucose (a simple sugar) is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide by microorganisms, most notably yeast.

Therefore, oxygen cannot be a product of fermentation. In fact, the presence of oxygen would inhibit the fermentation process and cause the yeast to undergo aerobic respiration instead, which produces carbon dioxide and water, not ethanol.\n\n**C. ethene and carbon dioxide**\nThe primary organic product of alcoholic fermentation is ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH), which is an alcohol. Ethene (C\u2082H\u2084) is an alkene, a different class of organic compound. While ethene can be produced from ethanol through a separate industrial process called dehydration, it is not a direct product of the fermentation of glucose.\n\n**D. ethene and oxygen**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, the product is ethanol, not ethene. Secondly, fermentation is an anaerobic process and does not produce oxygen.

Let's analyse each property:\n\n1.  **Decolourises aqueous bromine:** This is a test for unsaturation, specifically the presence of a carbon-carbon double (C=C) or triple (C\u2261C) bond. Alkenes and alkynes undergo an addition reaction with bromine, causing the reddish-brown bromine water to become colourless. Ethanoic acid is a saturated carboxylic acid; its structure (CH\u2083COOH) contains only single carbon-carbon bonds. Therefore, it does not react with aqueous bromine and does not decolourise it.\n\n2.  **Reacts with calcium carbonate to make carbon dioxide:** This is a characteristic reaction of acids. Acids react with metal carbonates to produce a salt, water, and carbon dioxide gas. Ethanoic acid, being an acid, reacts with calcium carbonate according to the following equation:\n    2CH\u2083COOH(aq) + CaCO\u2083(s) \u2192 (CH\u2083COO)\u2082Ca(aq) + H\u2082O(l) + CO\u2082(g)\n    The production of carbon dioxide gas (seen as effervescence) confirms this reaction occurs.\n\n3.  **Turns damp red litmus paper blue:** This is the test for an alkaline (basic) substance.

This is based on the principles of the kinetic particle theory.\n\n1.  **Effect of Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. A higher temperature means the particles possess more kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and randomly. Therefore, to achieve the fastest particle movement, a high temperature is required.\n\n2.  **Effect of Pressure:** Gas pressure is related to the frequency of collisions of particles with the container walls. For a fixed amount of gas, low pressure corresponds to a larger volume (according to Boyle's Law). When gas particles occupy a larger volume, the average distance between them increases. Therefore, to have the particles furthest apart, a low pressure is necessary.\n\nCombining these two factors, a high temperature ensures the particles move at their fastest, and a low pressure ensures they are, on average, the furthest apart.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: high temperature, high pressure**\n    This option is incorrect because while a high temperature causes particles to move fastest, a high pressure forces the particles into a smaller volume, causing them to be closer together, not the furthest apart.\n\n*   **B: low temperature, high pressure**\n    This option is incorrect because both conditions are the opposite of what is required. A low temperature results in particles with low kinetic energy, meaning they move slowly. A high pressure forces the particles to be very close together.\n\n*   **D: low temperature, low pressure**\n    This option is incorrect because while a low pressure allows the particles to be far apart, a low temperature means the particles have low kinetic energy and will therefore move slowly, not at their fastest."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_522.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "2 which statement describes a liquid at room temperature?\na asample of a liquid has a fixed volume and shape.\nb_  asample of a liquid does not have a fixed volume or shape.\nc_ the particles are touching but can move by sliding over each other.\nd_ the particles spread out and fill all available space.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nIn the liquid state, the constituent particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are in close contact with each other, but they are not held in fixed positions as they are in a solid. The particles in a liquid have enough kinetic energy to overcome the strong intermolecular forces that would hold them in a rigid lattice.

This particle arrangement and movement explains the macroscopic properties of liquids: they have a fixed volume because the particles are closely packed, but they take the shape of their container because the particles can flow.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A. A sample of a liquid has a fixed volume and shape.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while a liquid does have a fixed volume, it does not have a fixed shape. Liquids are fluids, meaning they flow and take the shape of the container they are in. The description of having both a fixed volume and a fixed shape applies to the solid state of matter.\n\n**B. A sample of a liquid does not have a fixed volume or shape.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because a liquid has a definite, fixed volume. If you pour a specific volume of liquid, such as 100 cm\u00b3, from one container to another, the volume remains 100 cm\u00b3. The substance described as having neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape is a gas, which expands to fill the entire volume of its container.\n\n**D. The particles spread out and fill all available space.**\n\nThis statement describes the behaviour of particles in a gas, not a liquid. In a gas, the particles have very high kinetic energy and the forces of attraction between them are negligible. This allows them to move far apart from each other and spread out to occupy the entire volume of any container.

The atomic nucleus is composed of two types of particles: protons and neutrons. Therefore, the nucleon number, which is also known as the mass number (symbol A), is the total count of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. This number represents the approximate mass of the atom, as protons and neutrons each have a relative mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit, while the mass of electrons is negligible.\n\n### Why Option A is Incorrect:\nThe number of neutrons alone does not represent the nucleon number. While neutrons are nucleons, the nucleon number is the sum of *all* particles in the nucleus. Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons; these variations are called isotopes. For example, carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, while carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Both are carbon atoms (with 6 protons), but they have different nucleon numbers (12 and 14, respectively).\n\n### Why Option B is Incorrect:\nThe number of protons in an atom's nucleus defines its atomic number (symbol Z) and determines the element's identity.

The atomic number is always less than or equal to the nucleon number.\n\n### Why Option D is Incorrect:\nElectrons are not nucleons because they are not found in the atomic nucleus. Instead, electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. The definition of the nucleon number is strictly limited to the particles that constitute the nucleus.

For an atom to have a third shell, the first two shells must be filled to their maximum capacity.\n    *   The first electron shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.\n    *   The second electron shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons.\n    *   The question states the third (outer) shell contains 3 electrons.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of electrons is the sum from all shells: 2 + 8 + 3 = 13 electrons.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of protons:** An atom is electrically neutral, meaning it has no overall charge. This is because the number of negatively charged electrons is balanced by an equal number of positively charged protons.\n    *   Since the atom has 13 electrons, it must also have 13 protons.\n    *   The number of protons (the atomic number) identifies this element as Aluminium (Al).\n\n3.  **Determine the number of neutrons:** The most common and stable isotope of Aluminium (Al) has a mass number of 27.

However, it incorrectly states the number of neutrons as 27. If an atom of this element (Aluminium) had 27 neutrons, its mass number would be 13 (protons) + 27 (neutrons) = 40. While isotopes of an element can have different numbers of neutrons, the isotope Aluminium-40 is extremely unstable and not naturally occurring. The most stable and common isotope is Aluminium-27, which contains 14 neutrons.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the number of protons. The electron configuration described (2 electrons in the first shell, 8 in the second, and 3 in the third) results in a total of 13 electrons. In a neutral atom, the number of protons must equal the number of electrons. Therefore, the atom must have 13 protons. An atom with 14 protons would be Silicon (Si) and, in its neutral state, would have 14 electrons with an electron configuration of 2, 8, 4.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the number of protons. The electron configuration described (2, 8, 3) gives a total of 13 electrons, meaning a neutral atom must have 13 protons. An atom with 21 protons is Scandium (Sc).

For instance, if one correctly calculates the relative formula mass of MgO as 40 and the number of moles of Mg as 2 (48 g / 24 g/mol), but then incorrectly divides the Mr of the product by the moles of the reactant (40 / 2 = 20), this incorrect value is obtained. This calculation is dimensionally and conceptually flawed. The correct procedure is to determine the moles of the product and then multiply by its molar mass.\n\n#### B: 40 g\nThis answer represents the relative formula mass (Mr) of one mole of magnesium oxide (MgO), which is 40. This error arises from confusing the mass of one mole of a substance with the total mass produced in the reaction.

While oxidation is a crucial part of electrolysis\u2014it occurs at the anode (the positive electrode)\u2014it represents only half of the overall process. Electrolysis also involves reduction (the gain of electrons) at the cathode (the negative electrode). Therefore, this statement is an incomplete description of the entire process.\n\n**C:** This statement defines an **electrolyte**, not electrolysis. An electrolyte is a substance that contains mobile ions and can therefore conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent (usually water). The electrolyte is the medium *through which* electrolysis occurs, but it is not the name of the process itself.\n\n**D:** This statement describes **electroplating**, which is a specific application of electrolysis. Electroplating is the process of depositing a thin layer of one metal onto the surface of another object using electrolysis. While it is an important industrial use of electrolysis, it is only one example. The general definition of electrolysis must encompass all its applications, including the extraction of reactive metals and the production of elements like chlorine and hydrogen.

Reduction, which is the gain of electrons, occurs at the cathode. To plate a copper spoon with silver, positively charged silver ions (Ag\u207a) from the electrolyte are attracted to the negatively charged cathode (the copper spoon). At the surface of the spoon, these silver ions gain electrons and are reduced to form a solid layer of silver metal. The half-equation for this reaction is: Ag\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s). Therefore, silver is indeed formed at the negative electrode.\n\n---\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Both the anode and cathode are made of carbon.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In electroplating, the cathode is the object that is being plated, which in this case is the copper spoon. The anode is typically made of the metal that is being used for the plating\u2014in this case, a piece of pure silver. Using a silver anode ensures that the concentration of silver ions in the electrolyte is kept constant, as the anode dissolves (is oxidised) at the same rate as silver ions are deposited at the cathode. Carbon electrodes are inert and would not serve this purpose.\n\n**B. The copper spoon is the anode.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The object to be electroplated is always made the cathode (the negative electrode). This is because the positively charged metal ions from the electrolyte must be attracted to it to be reduced and deposited as a metal layer. If the copper spoon were made the anode (the positive electrode), oxidation would occur. It would lose electrons, dissolve into the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a), and would not be coated with silver.\n\n**C. Aqueous copper(II) sulfate is the electrolyte.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The electrolyte in an electroplating cell must contain ions of the metal that is being used for plating. To coat an object with silver, the electrolyte must contain silver ions (Ag\u207a). A suitable electrolyte would be an aqueous solution of a soluble silver salt, such as silver nitrate (AgNO\u2083).

While reaction 2 is endothermic (temperature decreased from 18\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C), reaction 3 showed no change in temperature (initial and final temperatures were both 20\u00b0C). A reaction with no temperature change is considered thermoneutral, meaning it is neither endothermic nor exothermic.

A chemical change results in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties and is typically irreversible. When an egg is cooked, the heat causes the proteins within the egg (primarily albumin) to undergo a process called denaturation. The high temperature breaks the weak bonds holding the protein molecules in their specific, coiled shapes. The protein chains then unfold and form new, stronger cross-links with other protein molecules. This transforms the liquid, translucent egg white and liquid yolk into a solid, opaque substance. The new substance has different chemical and physical properties from the original raw egg, and this change cannot be easily reversed.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. boiling water**\n\nThis is a physical change. Boiling is a change of state from a liquid to a gas. Although the water changes from its liquid form to steam (gaseous form), its chemical composition remains H\u2082O. No new substances are formed; the water molecules are simply further apart and have more kinetic energy. This process is easily reversible by cooling the steam, which causes it to condense back into liquid water.\n\n**C. dissolving sugar**\n\nThis is a physical change. When sugar (sucrose) dissolves in water, its crystals break down into individual molecules that disperse throughout the water. However, the sugar molecules themselves are not chemically altered. No new substance is formed, and the chemical formula of the sugar remains the same. The sugar can be recovered by evaporating the water, demonstrating that the change is reversible.\n\n**D. melting ice cubes**\n\nThis is a physical change. Melting is a change of state from a solid to a liquid. When ice melts, solid water (H\u2082O) turns into liquid water (H\u2082O). The chemical identity of the substance does not change; it is still water. The change involves altering the arrangement and energy of the water molecules, not their chemical structure.

This indicates that the rate of reaction in Experiment 2 is faster than in Experiment 1. The question asks to identify the changes in conditions that would cause this increase in reaction rate.\n\n1.  **Add a catalyst:** A catalyst increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, without being consumed in the process. Adding a suitable catalyst to the reaction between zinc and sulfuric acid would speed up the production of hydrogen.\n3.  **Use zinc powder:** The initial experiment used zinc strips. Using zinc powder instead of strips significantly increases the total surface area of the solid reactant. According to collision theory, a larger surface area exposes more zinc particles to the acid, leading to a higher frequency of effective collisions per unit of time, thus increasing the reaction rate.\n4.  **Heat the acid:** Increasing the temperature of the reactants increases their kinetic energy. This leads to two effects: the particles move faster, resulting in more frequent collisions, and more importantly, a greater proportion of the colliding particles possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. This increases the frequency of successful collisions, thereby increasing the rate of reaction.\n\nSince changes 1, 3, and 4 all lead to an increased rate of reaction, they would all produce the results observed in Experiment 2.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B) 1 and 4 only:** This option is incorrect because it omits change 3 (using zinc powder). Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant by using a powder instead of strips is a valid method to increase the reaction rate. All three factors (1, 3, and 4) would cause the observed increase in rate.\n\n*   **C) 2 and 3:** This option is incorrect because it includes change 2 (dilute the acid). Diluting the acid means decreasing its concentration. A lower concentration of reactant particles leads to a lower frequency of collisions between the zinc and the acid. This would decrease the rate of reaction and increase the time taken to produce the hydrogen gas, which is the opposite of the observed result.\n\n*   **D) 2 and 4:** This option is incorrect for the same reason as C. It includes change 2 (dilute the acid). Diluting the acid would slow down the reaction, not speed it up.

According to the solubility table, barium nitrate (row 'barium', column 'nitrate') is soluble, and zinc chloride (row 'zinc', column 'chloride') is also soluble. Since both potential products are soluble in water, no precipitate will form, and the ions will remain dissolved in the solution.\n\n**B) barium nitrate and lead(II) nitrate**\n\nBoth barium nitrate (Ba(NO\u2083)\u2082) and lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082) are soluble salts. However, both salts share the same anion, the nitrate ion (NO\u2083\u207b). When these two solutions are mixed, the ions present are Ba\u00b2\u207a(aq), Pb\u00b2\u207a(aq), and NO\u2083\u207b(aq). No new combination of cation and anion is possible, so a double displacement reaction does not occur. Consequently, no insoluble salt can be formed.\n\n**D) potassium nitrate and zinc sulfate**\n\nWhen aqueous solutions of potassium nitrate (KNO\u2083) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO\u2084) are mixed, a double displacement reaction would produce potassium sulfate (K\u2082SO\u2084) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO\u2083)\u2082). Consulting the solubility table shows that potassium sulfate (row 'potassium', column 'sulfate') is soluble, and zinc nitrate (row 'zinc', column 'nitrate') is also soluble.

The halogens are in Group 17, and the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number: chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine.\n\nOne of the key trends in the halogen group is the change in melting and boiling points. As we move down the group, the atoms become larger and have more electrons. This leads to an increase in the strength of the intermolecular forces (specifically, van der Waals forces) between the diatomic molecules (Cl\u2082, Br\u2082, I\u2082, At\u2082). Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in higher melting and boiling points as you descend the group.\n\nThe data provided shows this trend:\n*   Melting point of chlorine = -101 \u00b0C\n*   Melting point of bromine = -7 \u00b0C\n*   Melting point of iodine = 114 \u00b0C\n\nThe melting point is clearly increasing.

As iodine is already a solid, astatine, with its higher melting point, will also be a solid.\n*   **B is incorrect.** Following the trend gas \u2192 liquid \u2192 solid, astatine is predicted to be a solid at room temperature, not a liquid. Its melting point will be significantly higher than room temperature, just as iodine's is.\n*   **C is incorrect.** This statement claims the melting point of astatine is between that of bromine (-7 \u00b0C) and chlorine (-101 \u00b0C). This contradicts the observed trend of *increasing* melting points down the group.\n*   **D is correct.** This statement accurately reflects the periodic trend.

This trend is due to the nature of metallic bonding. In a metal, positive ions are held together in a lattice by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. As you descend Group I, the atoms become larger due to the addition of extra electron shells. This increases the distance between the positive nucleus and the delocalised electrons, weakening the electrostatic forces of attraction that constitute the metallic bond. Since less energy is required to overcome these weaker forces, the melting point decreases. Lithium (Li) is in Period 2, while potassium (K) is in Period 4. Being higher up the group, lithium has stronger metallic bonds and consequently a higher melting point than potassium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Rubidium has a greater density than caesium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The general trend for density in Group I is that it increases down the group. As you move down the group, both the atomic mass and the atomic radius increase. However, the increase in mass is more significant than the increase in volume, leading to an overall increase in density (density = mass/volume). Rubidium (Rb) is in Period 5, and caesium (Cs) is in Period 6. Since caesium is below rubidium in the group, it has a greater density.\n\n**C. Potassium is more reactive than rubidium.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reactivity of Group I elements increases as you move down the group. The chemical reactivity of these metals depends on how easily they can lose their single outer shell electron to form a positive ion. As you descend the group, the atomic radius increases, and there is more shielding by inner electron shells. This means the outermost electron is held less tightly by the nucleus and is more easily lost. Potassium (K) is in Period 4, and rubidium (Rb) is in Period 5. Because rubidium is lower in the group, it is more reactive than potassium.\n\n**D. Rubidium atoms have more outer shell electrons than sodium atoms.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The group number of an element in the Periodic Table indicates the number of electrons in its outermost shell (valence electrons).

An alloy is a mixture of a metal with at least one other element. Brass is an alloy primarily composed of copper and zinc. In a pure metal like copper, the atoms are of a uniform size and arranged in regular, ordered layers. These layers can slide over each other easily, making the metal relatively soft and malleable.\n\nWhen zinc atoms are introduced to form the brass alloy, they disrupt this regular arrangement because zinc atoms are a different size from copper atoms. This distortion of the metallic lattice makes it more difficult for the layers of atoms to slide past one another. As a result, the alloy becomes harder (statement 1) and stronger (statement 4) than the pure parent metal, copper.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) 1 and 2:**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Metals conduct electricity due to the presence of delocalised electrons that are free to move throughout the metallic lattice. As alloys like brass are mixtures of metals, they retain this metallic structure and the sea of delocalised electrons. Therefore, brass is an electrical conductor.

These stresses include aerodynamic forces (lift and drag), the weight of the aircraft and its contents, and the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cabin at high altitudes. Aluminium, when alloyed with other metals such as copper, magnesium, and zinc, possesses a high tensile strength, providing the necessary structural integrity and resistance to deformation and failure.\n\n2.  **Low Density:** Minimising the mass of an aircraft is essential for its performance and economic viability. According to the principles of flight, a lower mass requires less lift and thrust, resulting in significantly better fuel efficiency. Aluminium has a density of approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is about one-third that of steel. This low density allows for the construction of a large, strong airframe that is also lightweight. The combination of high strength and low density gives aluminium a high strength-to-weight ratio, which is the primary reason for its extensive use in the aerospace industry.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**Option A: good conductor of electricity, good conductor of heat**\n\nWhile it is true that aluminium is a good conductor of both electricity and heat, these are not the primary properties that make it suitable for aircraft bodies. The main requirements for an aircraft's structure are strength and low mass. Although the electrical conductivity of the aluminium skin is useful in safely dissipating the energy from a lightning strike around the exterior of the plane (acting as a Faraday cage), this is a secondary benefit, not the principal reason for its selection. Good thermal conductivity is generally not a desired feature for the main body, as it would lead to faster heat transfer between the cold exterior and the climate-controlled cabin, requiring more insulation.\n\n**Option B: good conductor of electricity, strong**\n\nThis option correctly identifies strength as a vital property. An aircraft must be structurally robust to be safe. However, this option omits the equally critical property of low density. While many strong metals exist (e.g., steel), they are often too dense and heavy for use in aircraft construction, as this would make the aircraft inefficient and costly to operate. The combination of both strength *and* low mass is what makes aluminium uniquely suitable. Electrical conductivity is a secondary, not a primary, consideration.\n\n**Option C: good conductor of heat, low density**\n\nThis option correctly identifies low density as a vital property for keeping the aircraft lightweight and fuel-efficient. However, it incorrectly pairs this with good thermal conductivity as a key reason for its use. Structural strength is a non-negotiable requirement for an aircraft, and it is a far more important property than thermal conductivity in this context.

Carbon monoxide is reduced to carbon dioxide.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In the blast furnace, carbon monoxide (CO) acts as the primary reducing agent, meaning it causes another substance (iron(III) oxide) to be reduced. In the process, carbon monoxide itself is oxidised. Oxidation is the gain of oxygen.

The main reducing agent responsible for the reduction of iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) in the blast furnace is carbon monoxide (CO), not carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).

The refinery gas fraction is collected at the very top of the fractionating column because it has the lowest boiling point range (typically below 40\u00b0C). This fraction consists of the smallest hydrocarbon molecules, those with one to four carbon atoms (C1-C4). The simplest hydrocarbon in this fraction is methane (CH\u2084). A molecule of methane is composed of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, resulting in a total of five atoms (1 + 4 = 5). Since methane is a component of the refinery gas fraction, this statement is accurate.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The kerosene fraction is used as a fuel for ships.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While kerosene is a valuable fuel, its primary use is for jet engines in aircraft (jet fuel) and for domestic heating and lighting (paraffin). The fraction used as fuel for ships is fuel oil (also known as bunker fuel). Fuel oil consists of much larger hydrocarbon molecules than kerosene, has a significantly higher boiling point, and is collected much lower down in the fractionating column.\n\n**B. The fractions with the highest boiling points are extracted from the top of the fractionating column.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A fractionating column operates on a temperature gradient, being very hot at the bottom and gradually cooling towards the top. When the vaporised crude oil enters the column, components with very high boiling points condense into liquids at the higher temperatures near the bottom. Components with lower boiling points continue to rise as gases and condense at cooler temperatures further up the column. Therefore, the fractions with the highest boiling points (e.g., fuel oil and bitumen) are extracted from the bottom of the column, while fractions with the lowest boiling points (e.g., refinery gases) are extracted from the top.\n\n**C. The naphtha fraction contains larger hydrocarbon molecules than the lubricating oil fraction.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The size of hydrocarbon molecules is directly related to their boiling points. Larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces), which require more energy to overcome, resulting in higher boiling points. Lubricating oil is a fraction with very large hydrocarbon molecules (typically C20-C50) and a high boiling point, so it is collected low down in the fractionating column. Naphtha consists of smaller hydrocarbon molecules (typically C7-C14) with lower boiling points and is collected higher up the column than lubricating oil. Therefore, the naphtha fraction contains smaller, not larger, hydrocarbon molecules than the lubricating oil fraction."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_554.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "34 fertilisers are mixtures of different compounds used to increase the growth of crops.\nwhich pair of substances contain the three essential elements for plant growth?\na ammonium nitrate and calcium phosphate\nb ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride\nc ammonium phosphate and potassium chloride\nd potassium nitrate and calcium carbonate", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe three essential elements required for healthy plant growth that are commonly found in fertilisers are Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K).

Alkenes are a homologous series of unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a C=C double bond, and they have the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099. They react with bromine water in an addition reaction, where the double bond breaks and a bromine atom adds to each carbon atom. This reaction consumes the reddish-brown bromine, causing the solution to become colourless. Therefore, a hydrocarbon that decolourises bromine water could be an alkene, which has the general formula C\u2099H\u2082\u2099.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is an alkane.**\nAlkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, which means they only contain single carbon-carbon bonds (C-C). They do not have the C=C double bonds necessary to undergo an addition reaction with bromine water. Consequently, alkanes do not react with and do not decolourise bromine water under normal conditions. The statement contradicts the observation that the hydrocarbon decolourises bromine water.\n\n**B. Its molecular formula is C\u2082H\u2086.**\nThe molecular formula C\u2082H\u2086 corresponds to ethane. Ethane is an alkane, as its formula fits the general formula for alkanes, C\u2099H\u2082\u2099\u208a\u2082 (where n=2). As an alkane, ethane is a saturated hydrocarbon and will not decolourise bromine water. This is inconsistent with the information given in the question.\n\n**C. It is a saturated hydrocarbon.**\nA saturated hydrocarbon is one in which all the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds. This is the definition of a class of compounds that includes alkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons do not react with bromine water via an addition reaction and therefore do not decolourise it. The fact that the hydrocarbon in question *does* decolourise bromine water is direct evidence that it is an *unsaturated* hydrocarbon, not a saturated one."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_557.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 which statement describes how ethanol is manufactured from ethene?\na _ steam is added to ethene using an acid catalyst at 30\u00b0c.\nb_ steam is added to ethene using an acid catalyst at 300\u00b0c.\nc_ ethene is fermented using yeast at 30\u00b0c.\nd_ ethene is fermented using yeast at 300 \u00b0c.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe industrial manufacture of ethanol from ethene is achieved through the catalytic hydration of ethene. This process involves reacting ethene gas with steam (gaseous water) at high temperature and pressure. The specific conditions required are a temperature of 300\u00b0C, a high pressure of 60\u201370 atmospheres, and an acid catalyst, which is typically solid silicon dioxide coated with phosphoric(V) acid (H\u2083PO\u2084). The reaction is reversible: C\u2082H\u2084(g) + H\u2082O(g) \u21cc C\u2082H\u2085OH(g). The temperature of 300\u00b0C represents a compromise: it is high enough to ensure a fast rate of reaction but not so high that it excessively shifts the equilibrium position to the left (favouring the reactants).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While the reactants (steam and ethene) and the use of an acid catalyst are correct for this process, the specified temperature of 30\u00b0C is far too low. At this temperature, the rate of reaction between ethene and steam would be extremely slow, making the process industrially and economically unfeasible. High temperatures are necessary to provide the reactant molecules with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier.\n\n**C:** This statement describes the process of fermentation, which is another method of producing ethanol. However, fermentation uses glucose (a sugar, C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) as the starting material, not ethene (C\u2082H\u2084). Yeast contains enzymes (e.g., zymase) that catalyse the conversion of glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide. While the temperature of 30\u00b0C is appropriate for fermentation (it is the optimal temperature for the yeast enzymes), ethene cannot be fermented.\n\n**D:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option C, ethene cannot be used as a reactant in fermentation. Secondly, fermentation is a biological process that relies on enzymes in yeast. These enzymes are proteins that denature (lose their specific three-dimensional shape and function) at high temperatures. At 300\u00b0C, yeast would be destroyed, and its enzymes would be completely inactive, preventing any reaction from occurring."}, {"questionName": "IG_chem_p1_558.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0620_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 ethanoic acid reacts with aqueous sodium carbonate.\nwhich gas is given off in this reaction?\na_ hydrogen\nb_ carbon dioxide\nc carbon monoxide\ndoxygen", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "chemistry", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe reaction between ethanoic acid and aqueous sodium carbonate is a classic acid-carbonate reaction.

The general equation for such a reaction is: Acid + Reactive Metal \u2192 Salt + Hydrogen. The reaction in the question involves a metal carbonate (sodium carbonate), not a pure metal. The presence of the carbonate ion (CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b) leads to the production of carbon dioxide and water, not hydrogen gas.\n\n**C. carbon monoxide**\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is not a product of the reaction between an acid and a carbonate. It is typically formed during the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing compounds, where there is a limited supply of oxygen. The reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate is an acid-base neutralization reaction, not a combustion reaction.

The initial mixture consists of sand (an insoluble solid) and an aqueous salt solution (salt dissolved in water). When this mixture is poured through the filter paper in the funnel, the insoluble sand particles are too large to pass through the pores of the paper and are trapped.
