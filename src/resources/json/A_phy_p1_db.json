A complete representation of a physical quantity consists of both a numerical magnitude and a corresponding unit.\n\nThe expression **7.0 N** includes a numerical magnitude (7.0) and a unit (N, for newtons). The newton is the SI unit for the physical quantity of force. Therefore, 7.0 N is a complete and unambiguous representation of a specific amount of force, making it a physical quantity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. 3.0**\nThis is only a numerical value, or a magnitude. It lacks a unit, so it is impossible to know what physical property it refers to. For example, 3.0 could mean 3.0 metres, 3.0 seconds, or 3.0 amperes. Without a unit, it is just a number, not a physical quantity.\n\n**B. kilogram**\nThis is a unit of measurement, specifically the SI base unit for the physical quantity of mass. A unit on its own only defines the standard of measurement; it does not specify the magnitude of the quantity being measured. Therefore, \"kilogram\" is a unit, not a physical quantity.\n\n**D. 40%**\nA percentage is a dimensionless number that represents a ratio or a fraction out of 100.

Furthermore, the units on the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation must be equal to the units on the right-hand side (RHS).\n\nThe given equation is:\n1/T = b/\u221aD + c\n\n1.  **Determine the units of the LHS:**\n    The unit of T is given as seconds (s). Therefore, the unit of the term 1/T is 1/s, which can be written as s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of homogeneity:**\n    Since the unit of the LHS is s\u207b\u00b9, every term on the RHS must also have the unit of s\u207b\u00b9. This means:\n    *   The unit of the term `c` must be s\u207b\u00b9.\n    *   The unit of the term `b/\u221aD` must be s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n3.  **Determine the unit of `b`:**\n    We know the unit of the entire term `b/\u221aD` is s\u207b\u00b9. First, let's find the unit of the denominator, \u221aD.\n    *   The unit of D is m\u00b2.\n    *   The unit of \u221aD is \u221a(m\u00b2) = m.\n    Now, we can set up an equation for the units:\n    Unit of (`b/\u221aD`) = (Unit of `b`) / (Unit of \u221aD) = s\u207b\u00b9\n    (Unit of `b`) / m = s\u207b\u00b9\n    Solving for the unit of `b`:\n    Unit of `b` = m \u00d7 s\u207b\u00b9 = m s\u207b\u00b9\n\nTherefore, the unit of `b` is m s\u207b\u00b9 and the unit of `c` is s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. The principle of homogeneity requires that the unit of `c` must be the same as the unit of 1/T, which is s\u207b\u00b9, not s. Similarly, the unit of `b/\u221aD` must be s\u207b\u00b9. This leads to the unit of `b` being (unit of \u221aD) \u00d7 s\u207b\u00b9 = m \u00d7 s\u207b\u00b9 = m s\u207b\u00b9, not m s.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect. The unit of `c` must be s\u207b\u00b9, not s, to match the unit of 1/T (which is s\u207b\u00b9). The unit derived for `b` is m s\u207b\u00b9, which is different from the m\u207b\u00b9s given in this option.\n\n**D:** This option correctly identifies the unit of `c` as s\u207b\u00b9. However, it incorrectly identifies the unit of `b`. For the term `b/\u221aD` to have units of s\u207b\u00b9, the units of `b` must be such that (unit of `b`)/m = s\u207b\u00b9.

The formula for the lateral surface area (A) of a cylinder with radius (r) and length (l) is:\nA = 2\u03c0rl\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the surface area using the given mean values for radius and length:\nr = 3.0 cm\nl = 15.0 cm\nA = 2 * \u03c0 * (3.0 cm) * (15.0 cm) = 90\u03c0 cm\u00b2\nA \u2248 282.743... cm\u00b2\n\nNext, calculate the absolute uncertainty (\u0394A).

An uncertainty of `\u00b1 0.2 cm\u00b2` might arise from incorrectly adding the absolute uncertainties of the radius and length (0.1 cm + 0.1 cm = 0.2 cm). This is the wrong procedure for propagating uncertainties when quantities are multiplied; their fractional uncertainties should be added instead. The correctly calculated uncertainty is approximately 11 cm\u00b2, which is much larger than 0.2 cm\u00b2.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe value of the surface area, `420 cm\u00b2`, is incorrect. The lateral surface area is approximately `283 cm\u00b2`. Even if the area of the top and bottom circular faces were included (which would be incorrect for an open, hollow cylinder), the total surface area would be `2\u03c0rl + 2\u03c0r\u00b2 \u2248 283 + 2\u03c0(3.0)\u00b2 \u2248 339 cm\u00b2`. There is no standard calculation that results in 420 cm\u00b2. Consequently, both the value and its associated uncertainty are incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option confuses surface area with volume. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is `V = \u03c0r\u00b2l`. Using the given values:\nV = \u03c0 * (3.0 cm)\u00b2 * (15.0 cm) = 135\u03c0 cm\u00b3 \u2248 424.1 cm\u00b3\nThe numerical value `424.1` corresponds to the volume of the cylinder, not its surface area. The question asks for the surface area, which has units of cm\u00b2, not cm\u00b3 (volume).

This is incorrect because momentum is a vector, and the change in direction must be accounted for through vector subtraction.\n\n**C. 0.14 kg m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value is obtained by incorrectly adding the magnitudes of the initial and final momentum (0.080 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 + 0.060 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 = 0.14 kg m s\u207b\u00b9). This calculation does not represent the change in momentum. Adding the magnitudes would be relevant for finding the total momentum in a head-on, perfectly inelastic collision, but not for finding the vector change in momentum for a single object.\n\n**D. 0.50 kg m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value represents the magnitude of the change in velocity, |\u0394v|, not the magnitude of the change in momentum. The change in velocity is found using Pythagoras' theorem on the velocities: |\u0394v| = \u221a(0.40\u00b2 + 0.30\u00b2) = \u221a0.25 = 0.50 m s\u207b\u00b9. This value must then be multiplied by the mass (0.20 kg) to find the change in momentum, which gives the correct answer of 0.10 kg m s\u207b\u00b9.

According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), if the net horizontal force is zero, the horizontal acceleration must also be zero. This means the horizontal component of the ball's velocity remains constant throughout its flight. The ball is kicked at an angle of 45\u00b0, so it has an initial non-zero horizontal velocity. As this velocity component does not change, it is never zero during the flight.\n\n2.  **Vertical Motion:** The only force acting on the ball is gravity, which acts vertically downwards.

Since the vertical velocity is zero at the peak, the vertical momentum is also zero at that instant.\n\n*   **D. the vertical component of the ball's velocity:** As the ball travels upwards, its vertical velocity decreases due to the opposing force of gravity. At the very peak of its flight path, the vertical component of its velocity is momentarily zero before it begins to accelerate downwards.

Graphically, this means velocity is the gradient of the displacement-time graph, and acceleration is the gradient of the velocity-time graph.\n\n1.  **From Displacement to Velocity:**\n    The provided displacement-time (s-t) graph consists of straight-line segments.\n    *   In the first part of the motion, the graph is a straight line with a constant positive gradient. This signifies a constant positive velocity.\n    *   In the second part, the graph is a straight line with a constant negative gradient, signifying a constant negative velocity.\n    *   This pattern repeats. Therefore, the velocity-time (v-t) graph is a square wave, alternating between a constant positive velocity and a constant negative velocity.\n\n2.  **From Velocity to Acceleration:**\n    To find the acceleration-time (a-t) graph, we must find the gradient of the square-wave v-t graph.\n    *   During the intervals where velocity is constant (the horizontal parts of the square wave), the gradient of the v-t graph is zero. Thus, the acceleration is zero during these periods.\n    *   At the points where the velocity changes, the change is instantaneous.\n        *   When the object reaches its maximum displacement, the velocity abruptly changes from a positive value to a negative value. This instantaneous, large negative change in velocity corresponds to an infinite negative acceleration, which is represented as a downward-pointing spike or impulse.\n        *   When the object returns to zero displacement, the velocity abruptly changes from a negative value to a positive value. This corresponds to an infinite positive acceleration, represented as an upward-pointing spike or impulse.\n\nThis analysis shows that the a-t graph should be zero everywhere except at the points of instantaneous velocity change, where it exhibits sharp impulses. The first change in velocity (at the peak of displacement) is negative, and the second (at zero displacement) is positive, a pattern which is correctly shown in this graph.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis graph shows acceleration varying linearly with time (a triangular or sawtooth wave). For acceleration to vary linearly, the velocity, which is the integral of acceleration, must vary quadratically (i.e., the v-t graph would be a series of parabolas). Consequently, the displacement, which is the integral of velocity, would vary cubically. The provided displacement-time graph is composed of linear segments (a triangular wave), not cubic curves. Therefore, this representation of acceleration is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis graph shows acceleration as a square wave, alternating between a constant positive value and a constant negative value. If the acceleration were constant for a period, the velocity would change linearly during that period (from v = u + at). A square-wave acceleration-time graph would, therefore, produce a triangular-wave velocity-time graph. The displacement is the area under the velocity-time graph; integrating a triangular wave results in a graph made of connected parabolic segments. This contradicts the given displacement-time graph, which is composed of straight-line segments. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nSimilar to option B, this graph shows acceleration as a square wave, alternating between constant negative and positive values. This type of acceleration profile would lead to a velocity that changes linearly in segments, resulting in a triangular-wave velocity-time graph. Integrating this v-t graph to find displacement would yield a displacement-time graph composed of parabolic curves, not the straight-line segments shown in the original graph.

The term (mass \u00d7 change in speed) represents the change in momentum (\u0394p) for an object of constant mass moving in a straight line. The expression thus becomes (change in momentum) \u00d7 time taken, or \u0394p \u00d7 \u0394t. Since force (F) is \u0394p / \u0394t, this expression is equivalent to (F \u00d7 \u0394t) \u00d7 \u0394t = F(\u0394t)\u00b2, which is not force.\n\n**B. (mass \u00d7 change in speed) / time taken**\nThis expression represents mass \u00d7 (change in speed / time taken). The term (change in speed / time taken) is the rate of change of speed. This expression is equivalent to the formula F = ma, but with two important limitations:\n1.  **It is not the fundamental definition:** F = ma is a special case of Newton's Second Law, derived from F = \u0394p / \u0394t under the condition that the mass of the object is constant. The definition of force is the rate of change of momentum, which is more general.\n2.  **It uses \"speed\" instead of \"velocity\":** Force is a vector quantity and is related to acceleration, which is the rate of change of *velocity* (a vector), not just speed (a scalar). An object can have a constant speed but a changing velocity (e.g., in uniform circular motion), and thus a net force acting on it. This expression would incorrectly yield zero force in such a case.\n\n**C. (change of momentum) \u00d7 time taken**\nThis expression is dimensionally incorrect. It represents the change in momentum (\u0394p) multiplied by the time taken (\u0394t). From the definition of force, F = \u0394p / \u0394t, we can see that \u0394p \u00d7 \u0394t is equivalent to F \u00d7 (\u0394t)\u00b2. This quantity is not force.

This is an error in reading the exponent in standard form. A calculation with this incorrect mass would yield a time of approximately 15 seconds, which is incorrect because the ship's actual mass, and therefore its inertia, is 100 times larger.\n\n#### B: 150 seconds\nThis result is a factor of 10 smaller than the correct time in seconds (1500 s). Such an error could arise from a miscalculation, such as misinterpreting the stopping force as 9,200,000 N (a factor of 10 too large) or the mass as 8.4 \u00d7 10\u2076 kg (a factor of 10 too small).

At this instant, there is no air resistance. The only force acting on it is its weight, resulting in a net downward force. According to Newton's second law (F=ma), this causes the object to accelerate. The initial acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity, *g*. On a velocity-time graph, this corresponds to the graph starting at the origin (v=0, t=0) with a maximum positive gradient (gradient = acceleration).\n\n2.  **As Velocity Increases:** As the object accelerates and its velocity increases, the upward force of air resistance also increases. This progressively reduces the net downward force on the object (Net Force = Weight - Air Resistance).\n\n3.  **Decreasing Acceleration:** Since the net force is decreasing, the object's acceleration also decreases. On the velocity-time graph, this is represented by a decreasing gradient. The curve becomes less steep over time.\n\n4.  **Terminal Velocity:** Eventually, the object's velocity becomes high enough that the force of air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the object's weight. At this point, the net force is zero, and the acceleration becomes zero. The object stops accelerating and continues to fall at a constant maximum velocity, known as terminal velocity. On the graph, this is shown by the gradient becoming zero, meaning the line becomes horizontal.\n\nGraph D correctly illustrates this entire process: it starts at the origin, has an initial steep gradient that gradually decreases, and eventually becomes horizontal, indicating a constant terminal velocity.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer A\n\nGraph A depicts an object whose velocity increases linearly with time, starting from the origin. A straight line on a velocity-time graph signifies a constant, non-zero acceleration. This model accurately represents an object undergoing free fall in a vacuum, where the only force is gravity, and thus the acceleration is constant (*g*). However, it fails to account for the presence of the Earth's atmosphere, where air resistance opposes the motion and causes the acceleration to decrease as velocity increases. Therefore, this graph is incorrect for an object falling through the atmosphere.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer B\n\nGraph B shows that the velocity is constant and non-zero for all time t \u2265 0. This implies that the object's acceleration is always zero. This contradicts the physical situation described, as an object \"falling from rest\" must initially have zero velocity and then accelerate due to the force of gravity. This graph would represent an object already moving at its terminal velocity or an object moving with no net force acting on it, neither of which matches the initial conditions of the problem.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nGraph C shows the velocity of an object starting from rest and increasing with time. However, the slope (gradient) of the curve is increasing. Since the gradient of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration, this graph depicts an object with an increasing acceleration. This is physically incorrect for an object falling through the atmosphere. In reality, the force of air resistance increases with velocity, which causes the net force and therefore the acceleration to *decrease* over time, not increase."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_10.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "10 which statement about collisions is correct?\na kinetic energy is conserved in all collisions.\nb momentum is only conserved in perfectly elastic collisions.\nc_ the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation for perfectly\nelastic collisions.\nd when two objects of different masses collide, they exert forces of different magnitudes on\neach other.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nA perfectly elastic collision is defined as a collision in which both total momentum and total kinetic energy of the system are conserved. A direct mathematical consequence of these two conservation principles is that the relative speed at which the two objects approach each other before the collision is equal to the relative speed at which they separate after the collision. This property, where the relative speed is conserved, is a defining characteristic of a perfectly elastic collision.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Kinetic energy is conserved in all collisions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Kinetic energy is only conserved in perfectly elastic collisions. In inelastic collisions, some of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as thermal energy (heat), sound energy, and potential energy associated with permanent deformation of the colliding objects. Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the system decreases in an inelastic collision.\n\n**B. Momentum is only conserved in perfectly elastic collisions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The principle of conservation of linear momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system (a system with no external forces acting on it) remains constant. During a collision, the forces the objects exert on each other are internal to the system. As long as external forces like friction or air resistance are negligible, total momentum is conserved in **all** types of collisions, including both elastic and inelastic collisions.\n\n**D. When two objects of different masses collide, they exert forces of different magnitudes on each other.**\nThis statement is incorrect. According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects collide, the force exerted by the first object on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second object on the first. This is true for any interaction between two objects, regardless of their masses, velocities, or the nature of the collision. While the *effect* of the force (the acceleration) will be different for the two masses (in accordance with Newton's Second Law, F=ma), the forces themselves are an action-reaction pair and must be equal in magnitude."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_11.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "11 a satellite uses two thrusters to adjust its motion in space.\neach thruster exerts a force of 40n on the satellite. the line of action of each force is a\nperpendicular distance of 2.3m from the centre of gravity of the satellite. these two parallel\nforces act in opposite directions.\n[all\n|\nail\nll lil 40n\ni. 2.3m h\na) 7! i thruster\nthrust v\nruster ~ [\\ h 2a\n40n al \u2018\nsatellite tt\nwail\n| jill\nwhat are the magnitudes of the torque and the resultant force acting on the satellite due to the\ntwo thrust forces?\ntorque resultant\n/nm force/n\na 92 0\nb 92 80\ncc 180 0\nd 180 80", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Resultant Force Calculation:**\n    The resultant force is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object. In this case, there are two forces acting on the satellite: one 40 N force upwards and one 40 N force downwards. Since these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they cancel each other out.\n    \n    Resultant Force = 40 N + (-40 N) = 0 N.\n    \n    A zero resultant force means the satellite will not experience any linear acceleration; its centre of gravity will either remain at rest or continue to move with a constant velocity.\n\n2.  **Torque Calculation:**\n    Torque is the turning effect of a force, calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force (Torque = F \u00d7 d). The two forces acting on the satellite form a couple, which causes a purely rotational motion. The pivot point is the satellite's centre of gravity.\n\n    *   The torque produced by the first thruster is:\n        \u03c4\u2081 = 40 N \u00d7 2.3 m = 92 Nm.\n    *   The torque produced by the second thruster is:\n        \u03c4\u2082 = 40 N \u00d7 2.3 m = 92 Nm.\n\n    As shown in the diagram, both forces will cause the satellite to rotate in the same direction (clockwise). Therefore, the total torque is the sum of the individual torques.\n    \n    Total Torque = \u03c4\u2081 + \u03c4\u2082 = 92 Nm + 92 Nm = 184 Nm.\n    \n    The calculated total torque is 184 Nm. The value of 180 Nm provided in the option is the closest to this calculated value. The slight difference is likely due to the rounding of the numbers given in the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe resultant force is 0 N, and the total torque is approximately 180 Nm. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: torque = 92 Nm; resultant force = 0 N**\nThis option correctly identifies the resultant force as 0 N. However, it incorrectly states the magnitude of the torque. The value of 92 Nm is the torque produced by only *one* of the thrusters. Since both thrusters contribute to the rotation in the same direction, their torques must be added to find the total torque, which is 184 Nm.\n\n**B: torque = 92 Nm; resultant force = 80 N**\nThis option is incorrect for both quantities. The torque of 92 Nm is incorrect as it only accounts for one thruster. The resultant force is 0 N, not 80 N. A resultant force of 80 N would occur if both 40 N forces acted in the same direction (40 N + 40 N = 80 N). The problem states they are parallel and act in opposite directions.\n\n**D: torque = 180 Nm; resultant force = 80 N**\nThis option has the correct approximate value for the total torque. However, it incorrectly states the resultant force. The two forces are equal and opposite, so their vector sum is zero (40 N - 40 N = 0 N).

This means the net force acting on it is zero. The forces acting on the nail are the two tension forces from the string pulling downwards and the reaction force `R` from the wall pushing upwards.\n\nFor vertical equilibrium, the upward force `R` must balance the sum of the downward vertical components of the tension forces. This total downward force exerted by the string on the nail is ultimately what supports the entire weight of the picture, `W`. Therefore, the magnitude of the reaction force `R` must be equal to the weight of the picture, `W`.\n\nSince the same picture is used in both diagrams, its weight `W` is constant.\n*   In diagram 1, `R\u2081 = W`.\n*   In diagram 2, `R\u2082 = W`.\n*   Therefore, `R\u2081 = R\u2082`.\n\n**Analysis of the Tension (T):**\nThe picture frame is also in static equilibrium. The downward force of its weight `W` is balanced by the upward vertical components of the two tension forces in the string.\n\nLet `\u03b8` be the angle that each part of the string makes with the horizontal. By resolving forces vertically on the picture frame, the equilibrium condition is given by:\n`2 * T * sin(\u03b8) = W`\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the tension `T` as:\n`T = W / (2 * sin(\u03b8))`\n\nIn diagram 1, the string is shorter than in diagram 2. For the fixed horizontal distance between the attachment points, a shorter string will result in a smaller angle `\u03b8\u2081` with the horizontal. Conversely, the longer string in diagram 2 results in a larger angle `\u03b8\u2082`. Thus, `\u03b8\u2081 < \u03b8\u2082`.\n\nThe sine function is an increasing function for angles between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Therefore, `sin(\u03b8\u2081) < sin(\u03b8\u2082)`.\n\nLooking at the equation `T = W / (2 * sin(\u03b8))`, the tension `T` is inversely proportional to `sin(\u03b8)`. A smaller value for `sin(\u03b8)` will result in a larger value for the tension `T`. Since `sin(\u03b8\u2081) < sin(\u03b8\u2082)`, it follows that the tension in the first case is greater than in the second case:\n`T\u2081 > T\u2082`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining the two analyses, we find that `R\u2081 = R\u2082` and `T\u2081 > T\u2082`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: `R\u2081 = R\u2082`, `T\u2081 = T\u2082`**\nThis option is incorrect because, while `R\u2081 = R\u2082` is true, `T\u2081 = T\u2082` is false. The tension in the string depends on the angle it makes with the horizontal. Because the string in diagram 1 is shorter, it makes a smaller angle with the horizontal (`\u03b8\u2081 < \u03b8\u2082`). To provide the same vertical support for the picture's weight, a smaller angle requires a greater tension. Therefore, `T\u2081` must be greater than `T\u2082`.\n\n**C: `R\u2081 > R\u2082`, `T\u2081 < T\u2082`**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, `R\u2081 > R\u2082` is false. The reaction force `R` from the nail supports the weight of the picture, which is the same in both cases. Therefore, `R\u2081 = R\u2082`. Secondly, `T\u2081 < T\u2082` is false. The shorter string in diagram 1 results in a smaller angle with the horizontal, which necessitates a larger tension (`T\u2081 > T\u2082`) to balance the picture's weight.\n\n**D: `R\u2081 < R\u2082`, `T\u2081 = T\u2082`**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, `R\u2081 < R\u2082` is false. The reaction force `R` is equal to the picture's weight in both scenarios, so `R\u2081 = R\u2082`. Secondly, `T\u2081 = T\u2082` is false. The tensions are different because the angles of the strings are different.

Pressure is force divided by area. The unit of force is the Newton (kg\u22c5m\u22c5s\u207b\u00b2), and the unit of area is m\u00b2. Thus, the unit of pressure is Pa (N/m\u00b2 or kg\u22c5m\u207b\u00b9\u22c5s\u207b\u00b2). The force exerted by the object is its weight, which depends on the acceleration due to gravity, `g`.

The calculation would be V = 2.00 / (1.03 \u00d7 10\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81) \u2248 1.98 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 m\u00b3. This is incorrect because the upthrust must support the weight of the entire system, not just a part of it. The weight of the sphere also contributes to the total downward force.\n\n**B: 2.97 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 m\u00b3**\nThis value is obtained by incorrectly subtracting the weight of the probe and string from the weight of the sphere (5.00 N - 2.00 N = 3.00 N) and setting this as the upthrust. The calculation would be V = 3.00 / (1.03 \u00d7 10\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81) \u2248 2.97 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 m\u00b3.

An object is composed of many individual particles, and the force of gravity (weight) acts on each of these particles. The centre of gravity is the average position of the weight distribution.

The net torque *produced by the force of gravity itself* about the centre of gravity is always zero. However, the overall net torque on an object (due to all forces, including applied forces) is only zero if the object is in rotational equilibrium. The definition of the centre of gravity must be valid regardless of the object's state of motion. The primary definition is based on the effective point of action of the weight, not on the condition of zero torque.\n\n**D: the point where gravity acts on the object**\n\nThis statement is a misleading oversimplification. Gravity is a field force, meaning it acts on every particle with mass throughout the entire volume of the object. It does not act at a single point.

Multiplying the efficiency by the wasted power gives:\n0.74 \u00d7 230 W = 170.2 W.\nThis is incorrect because efficiency relates the useful output power to the *total input power*, not the wasted power.\n\n#### B: 310 W\nThis answer may result from an incorrect application of the efficiency formula.

It incorrectly relates the wasted power (which corresponds to 26% of the total) with the efficiency (74%).\n\n#### D: 880 W\nThis value is a good approximation of the **total input power**, not the useful output power. The total input power can be calculated by recognizing that the 230 W of wasted power represents 26% of the total:\nTotal Input Power = Wasted Power / (Percentage Wasted)\nTotal Input Power = 230 W / 0.26 \u2248 884.6 W, which is close to 880 W.\nHowever, the question asks for the *useful output power*.

The total mechanical energy (E) of the projectile is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and gravitational potential energy (GPE). The work-energy principle, considering a non-conservative force like air resistance, states that the work done against air resistance is equal to the decrease in the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nWork done against air resistance = Initial Mechanical Energy - Final Mechanical Energy\nW_air = E_initial - E_final\nW_air = (KE_initial + GPE_initial) - (KE_final + GPE_final)\n\nFirst, calculate the initial and final kinetic energies using the formula KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2:\n*   Initial KE = \u00bd * (0.25 kg) * (15 m/s)\u00b2 = \u00bd * 0.25 * 225 = 28.125 J\n*   Final KE = \u00bd * (0.25 kg) * (5.0 m/s)\u00b2 = \u00bd * 0.25 * 25 = 3.125 J\n\nNext, calculate the initial and final gravitational potential energies using the formula GPE = mgh, with g \u2248 9.81 m/s\u00b2:\n*   Initial GPE = (0.25 kg) * (9.81 m/s\u00b2) * (30 m) = 73.575 J\n*   Final GPE = (0.25 kg) * (9.81 m/s\u00b2) * (35 m) = 85.8375 J\n\nNow, calculate the total initial and final mechanical energies:\n*   E_initial = 28.125 J + 73.575 J = 101.7 J\n*   E_final = 3.125 J + 85.8375 J = 88.9625 J\n\nFinally, calculate the work done against air resistance:\n*   W_air = E_initial - E_final = 101.7 J - 88.9625 J = 12.7375 J\n\nThis value, rounded to two significant figures, is 13 J.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 0 J**\nThis answer would be correct only if the total mechanical energy of the projectile were conserved. Mechanical energy is conserved only when no non-conservative forces, such as air resistance or friction, are doing work on the system. In this problem, the loss in kinetic energy (-25 J) is not equal to the gain in potential energy (+12.3 J), indicating that total mechanical energy was not conserved and work was done by a non-conservative force.\n\n**C: 25 J**\nThis value represents only the loss in kinetic energy of the projectile.\n*   Loss in KE = KE_initial - KE_final = 28.125 J - 3.125 J = 25 J.\nThis calculation incorrectly ignores the change in the projectile's gravitational potential energy. As the projectile gained height, some of its initial kinetic energy was converted into gravitational potential energy. The work done against air resistance is the total energy lost from the system, not just the loss in kinetic energy.\n\n**D: 37 J**\nThis answer is likely obtained by incorrectly summing the magnitude of the change in kinetic energy and the magnitude of the change in gravitational potential energy.\n*   Loss in KE = 25 J\n*   Gain in GPE = GPE_final - GPE_initial = 85.8375 J - 73.575 J \u2248 12.3 J\n*   25 J + 12.3 J \u2248 37 J\nThis is incorrect because energy is a scalar quantity. The loss in kinetic energy is distributed between the gain in potential energy and the work done against air resistance.

The calculation for extension is x = F / k = 35.0 N / 420 N m\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 0.083 m.

On a force-extension graph, this is represented by the unloading curve following the exact same path as the loading curve, returning to the origin (0,0). The problem states that the loading and unloading graph lines are the same. This means that when the force is decreased back to zero, the extension also returns to zero, leaving no permanent deformation. Therefore, the deformation is entirely elastic. It is important to note that the graph is not a straight line for its entire length. This indicates that for higher forces, the wire has exceeded its limit of proportionality (where force is directly proportional to extension), but it has not exceeded its elastic limit. A material can still be perfectly elastic even if it does not obey Hooke's law.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: It is both elastic and plastic.**\nIf a material undergoes both elastic and plastic deformation, it means it has been stretched beyond its elastic limit. In this case, upon unloading, the material would not return to its original length. The unloading curve on the graph would be a straight line parallel to the initial linear portion of the loading curve, but it would not return to the origin. It would intersect the extension axis at a positive value, representing the permanent extension. Since the problem states the loading and unloading curves are identical, no permanent extension has occurred, so this option is incorrect.\n\n**C: It is neither elastic nor plastic.**\nWhen a solid material is deformed by an external force, its response is classified as either elastic, plastic, or a combination of both. It is not physically possible for the deformation to be neither of these. The material either returns to its original shape (elastic) or it doesn't (plastic). Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**D: It is plastic only.**\nPlastic deformation is a permanent deformation. If the deformation were only plastic, the wire would not return to its original length when the force is removed. The unloading process would not retrace the loading path back to the origin.

The phase of a particle's oscillation depends on its position along the wave.\n\nThe phase difference (`\u03c6`) between two particles, P and Q, separated by a fixed horizontal distance (`\u0394x`) is determined by how much of a wavelength (`\u03bb`) separates them. The formula for phase difference is:\n\n`\u03c6 = (2\u03c0 / \u03bb) * \u0394x`\n\nIn this scenario:\n1.  The wave is a progressive wave, so its wavelength `\u03bb` is constant.\n2.  The particles P and Q are at a fixed horizontal distance apart, so `\u0394x` is constant.\n\nSince both `\u03bb` and `\u0394x` are constant values, the phase difference `\u03c6` between the oscillations of particle P and particle Q is also constant. It does not change with time.\n\nA graph representing a constant value over time is a horizontal line. The initial diagram shows that at `t = 0`, P and Q are at different points in their respective oscillation cycles (P is at a crest, Q is moving towards a trough), meaning their phase difference is non-zero. Therefore, the graph of `\u03c6` against `t` must be a horizontal line at a non-zero value, as shown in graph D.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A)** This graph shows the phase difference varying sinusoidally with time. This would only occur if the phase relationship between the two particles was continuously changing. However, for a single progressive wave, every particle oscillates with the same frequency, leading to a constant, not an oscillating, phase difference between any two fixed points.\n\n**B)** Similar to option A, this graph also depicts a sinusoidally varying phase difference. This incorrectly suggests that the phase relationship between particles P and Q changes over time. In a progressive wave, the time it takes for a wave crest to travel from the position of P to the position of Q is constant, which means their phase difference must also be constant.\n\n**C)** This graph shows the phase difference changing linearly with time. A linearly changing phase difference (`\u03c6 \u221d t`) would imply that the two particles are oscillating at different frequencies. This phenomenon, known as beats, occurs when two waves of slightly different frequencies superpose.

In a transverse wave, the oscillations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation. This allows for multiple planes of oscillation. Polarisation is the process of restricting these oscillations to a single plane.\n\nIn contrast, a longitudinal wave consists of oscillations that are parallel to the direction of energy propagation (e.g., compressions and rarefactions in a sound wave). Since the oscillations already occur along a single axis (the direction of travel), there is no other plane of oscillation to restrict. Therefore, longitudinal waves cannot be polarised. The statement that *both* wave types can be polarised is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B. Both waves can form stationary waves.**\nThis statement is correct. A stationary (or standing) wave is formed by the principle of superposition when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travel in opposite directions.

This effect explains the change in the observed frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nWhen the source of a sound wave moves away from a stationary observer, the wavefronts emitted by the source are spaced further apart in the direction of the observer. This means the observer perceives a longer wavelength (\u03bb') than the actual wavelength (\u03bb) emitted by the source. The speed of sound (v) in the medium (air) remains constant, as it is determined by the properties of the medium, not the motion of the source.\n\nAccording to the wave equation, v = f\u03bb, where f is the frequency. Since the observed wavelength (\u03bb') has increased and the speed of sound (v) is constant, the observed frequency (f') must decrease (f' = v/\u03bb'). This results in the observer hearing a lower pitch. Therefore, the source moving away from the observer is the correct reason for the observed frequency being less than the emitted frequency.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**B) The source is moving towards the observer.**\nIf the source were moving towards the observer, the wavefronts would be compressed in the direction of the observer. This would lead to a perceived decrease in wavelength. With the speed of sound remaining constant, a shorter wavelength would result in a higher observed frequency, which is the opposite of what is stated in the problem.\n\n**C) The speed of the sound wave in air decreases due to the movement of the source.**\nThis statement is incorrect.

The motion of the source does not alter the speed at which the sound wave travels through the medium.

The relationship between the frequency (f), wavelength (\u03bb), and speed (c) of an electromagnetic wave is given by the wave equation: c = f\u03bb. The speed of light in a vacuum, c, is approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s.\n\nThe visible spectrum is commonly defined by its wavelength range, from approximately 400 nanometres (nm) for violet light to 700 nanometres (nm) for red light. To find the corresponding frequency range, we can rearrange the wave equation to f = c/\u03bb.\n\n- For red light (\u03bb \u2248 700 nm = 700 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m):\n  f = (3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s) / (700 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m) \u2248 4.29 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz\n\n- For violet light (\u03bb \u2248 400 nm = 400 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m):\n  f = (3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s) / (400 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m) = 7.50 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz\n\nThe calculated frequency range is approximately 4.29 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz to 7.50 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz. The prefix \"tera\" (T) represents 10\u00b9\u00b2, so 1 THz = 10\u00b9\u00b2 Hz. Converting the calculated frequencies to terahertz:\n\n- 4.29 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz = 429 THz\n- 7.50 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz = 750 THz\n\nTherefore, the approximate frequency range for visible light is (430\u2013750) THz, which corresponds to the values in this option.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe unit kHz stands for kilohertz, where 1 kHz = 10\u00b3 Hz. Frequencies in the range of (430\u2013750) kHz fall within the radio wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the Medium Frequency (MF) band. These low frequencies are used for applications such as AM radio broadcasting. The frequency of visible light is about a billion times higher (10\u2079) than this range. These frequencies are far too low to be detected by the human eye as light.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThe unit MHz stands for megahertz, where 1 MHz = 10\u2076 Hz. Frequencies in the range of (430\u2013750) MHz are also in the radio wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band. This band is used for technologies like television broadcasting, mobile phone communication, and Wi-Fi. While higher than kilohertz, this frequency range is still about a million times too low (10\u2076) for visible light.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe unit GHz stands for gigahertz, where 1 GHz = 10\u2079 Hz. Frequencies in the range of (430\u2013750) GHz are in the microwave and far-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These frequencies are used for high-speed data transmission, satellite communication, and radio astronomy.

The filter is then rotated clockwise by 30\u00b0. The angle *\u03b8* between the vertical polarisation of the light and the filter's new transmission axis is 30\u00b0.\nAccording to Malus's Law, the transmitted intensity *I*\u2083\u2080 is:\n*I*\u2083\u2080 = *I*<sub>initial</sub> cos\u00b2(30\u00b0)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the new intensity**\nThe filter is then rotated clockwise by a *further* 30\u00b0. The total angle of rotation from the initial vertical position is now 30\u00b0 + 30\u00b0 = 60\u00b0.\nThe incident light is still the original vertically polarised beam with intensity *I*<sub>initial</sub>. The angle between its polarisation and the filter's final transmission axis is now 60\u00b0.\nThe new transmitted intensity, *I*<sub>new</sub>, is:\n*I*<sub>new</sub> = *I*<sub>initial</sub> cos\u00b2(60\u00b0)\n\n**Step 3: Express the new intensity in terms of *I*\u2083\u2080**\nTo find the relationship between *I*<sub>new</sub> and *I*\u2083\u2080, we can take the ratio of the two intensity equations:\n*I*<sub>new</sub> / *I*\u2083\u2080 = (*I*<sub>initial</sub> cos\u00b2(60\u00b0)) / (*I*<sub>initial</sub> cos\u00b2(30\u00b0))\nThe *I*<sub>initial</sub> terms cancel out:\n*I*<sub>new</sub> / *I*\u2083\u2080 = cos\u00b2(60\u00b0) / cos\u00b2(30\u00b0)\n\nNow, we substitute the values for cosine:\ncos(60\u00b0) = 0.5\ncos(30\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2 \u2248 0.866\ncos\u00b2(60\u00b0) = (0.5)\u00b2 = 0.25\ncos\u00b2(30\u00b0) = (\u221a3 / 2)\u00b2 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio:\n*I*<sub>new</sub> / *I*\u2083\u2080 = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the new intensity is:\n*I*<sub>new</sub> = (1/3) *I*\u2083\u2080 \u2248 0.33 *I*\u2083\u2080\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 0.25 *I*\u2083\u2080**\nThis answer would be obtained by incorrectly applying Malus's Law in a sequential manner, as if the light with intensity *I*\u2083\u2080 were incident on a second filter. For example, by calculating *I*<sub>new</sub> = *I*\u2083\u2080 cos\u00b2(60\u00b0). This is incorrect because the problem describes a single filter whose orientation is changed. The incident intensity on the filter remains *I*<sub>initial</sub> at all times; it is not the intermediate intensity *I*\u2083\u2080. The angle in Malus's law must always be relative to the polarisation of the original incident beam.\n\n**C. 0.75 *I*\u2083\u2080**\nThis result could be obtained from the erroneous calculation *I*<sub>new</sub> = *I*\u2083\u2080 cos\u00b2(30\u00b0). This incorrectly uses the *additional* angle of rotation (30\u00b0) as the angle *\u03b8* in Malus's law and incorrectly uses the intermediate intensity *I*\u2083\u2080 as the incident intensity. The correct application of Malus's Law requires using the *total* angle (60\u00b0) between the incident light's polarisation and the filter's final transmission axis.\n\n**D. 0.87 *I*\u2083\u2080**\nThis answer likely results from a failure to square the cosine term in Malus's Law. The value 0.87 is approximately the value of cos(30\u00b0). An incorrect formula, such as *I* = *I*\u2080 cos(*\u03b8*), might lead to this answer through a calculation like *I*<sub>new</sub> = *I*\u2083\u2080 cos(30\u00b0).

The frequency 184 Hz is the second harmonic (2 \u00d7 92 Hz). Even harmonics cannot be produced in a pipe that is closed at one end and open at the other.

A stationary wave with *n* antinodes will have *(n+1)* nodes. In this case, there are 2 antinodes, so this corresponds to the second harmonic (n = 2).\n\n2.  **Relate String Length, Wavelength, and Harmonics:** The length of the string L is related to the wavelength \u03bb and the harmonic number n by the formula:\n    L = n (\u03bb / 2)\n\n    For the initial wave (n\u2081 = 2), the length of the string is:\n    L = 2 (\u03bb\u2081 / 2) = \u03bb\u2081\n    where \u03bb\u2081 is the initial wavelength.\n\n3.  **Use the Wave Speed Equation:** The speed of a wave (v) on the string is given by v = f\u03bb.

One antinode corresponds to the fundamental frequency (the first harmonic, n=1). For the number of antinodes to decrease from two to one, the frequency would need to be halved, not doubled. Doubling the frequency results in a shorter wavelength and therefore more antinodes fitting onto the string.\n\n**B) 2:** An incorrect answer. This is the number of antinodes in the *initial* stationary wave. Since the frequency of the constituent waves is changed, the wavelength must also change (as v = f\u03bb and v is constant). A change in wavelength for a fixed string length results in a different standing wave pattern, meaning the number of nodes and antinodes must change.\n\n**C) 3:** An incorrect answer. Three antinodes correspond to the third harmonic (n=3). The frequency of the nth harmonic is given by f\u2099 = n(v/2L). The initial frequency (n=2) is f\u2082 = 2(v/2L). The frequency for three antinodes would be f\u2083 = 3(v/2L). The ratio f\u2083/f\u2082 = 1.5.

The extent to which a wave diffracts is determined by the relationship between its wavelength (\u03bb) and the size of the obstacle. Significant diffraction occurs when the wavelength of the wave is comparable to or larger than the size of the obstacle.\n\nIn this scenario, the obstacle is a mountain, which has a size on the order of kilometers.\n*   **Radio waves:** The wavelength is given as 1.5 km. This is comparable to the size of the mountain, so the radio waves will undergo significant diffraction. This allows them to bend around the mountain and reach the receiving aerial located in the 'shadow' region.\n*   **Microwaves:** The wavelength is 1.5 cm (or 0.000015 km). This is extremely small compared to the size of the mountain. Consequently, the microwaves experience negligible diffraction. They travel in essentially straight lines (rectilinear propagation) and are blocked by the mountain, preventing them from reaching the receiving aerial.\n\nTherefore, the radio waves are received due to diffraction, while the microwaves are not.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The radio waves are coherent but the microwaves are not.**\nCoherence refers to a constant phase relationship between waves. While signals from a transmitter are generally coherent, coherence is not the physical principle that explains why waves can be received behind an obstacle. The ability of a wave to bend around an object is governed by diffraction, not coherence. Both wave types would be transmitted with a degree of coherence.\n\n**C: The radio waves are reflected by the mountain but the microwaves are not.**\nBoth microwaves and radio waves are electromagnetic waves and would be reflected by the mountain's surface. Reflection causes waves to bounce off a surface, and it would not typically direct the signal into the region directly behind the mountain. The mechanism that allows waves to propagate into a shadow region is diffraction, not reflection.\n\n**D: The radio waves travel at the speed of light but the microwaves do not.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Both radio waves and microwaves are forms of electromagnetic radiation. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light (c).

The waves emitted have the same frequency.\n2.  There is a constant phase difference between the waves.\n\nThis constant phase relationship is the defining characteristic of coherence. It means that if the crest of one wave leads the crest of the other by a certain fraction of a cycle at one moment, it will lead by that same fraction at all other moments. This property is necessary to produce a stable and observable interference pattern. Therefore, the statement that the waves must have a constant phase difference is correct by definition.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) They are in phase.**\n\"In phase\" is a specific case of coherence where the constant phase difference is zero. While coherent waves *can* be in phase, it is not a requirement. For example, two waves can be coherent if one consistently lags behind the other by half a wavelength (a phase difference of \u03c0 radians or 180\u00b0). The key condition for coherence is that this phase difference remains constant, not that it must be zero.\n\n**B) They are transverse waves.**\nCoherence is a fundamental property of waves that is not restricted to a particular wave type. Both transverse waves (e.g., light, ripples on water) and longitudinal waves (e.g., sound) can be coherent. For instance, two loudspeakers emitting sound of the same frequency with a constant phase relationship are considered coherent sources. Therefore, the waves do not necessarily have to be transverse.\n\n**D) They have the same amplitude.**\nAmplitude is related to the energy or intensity of a wave. While waves with the same or similar amplitudes produce the most distinct interference patterns (with maximum contrast between constructive and destructive interference), it is not a condition for coherence. Two waves with different amplitudes can still be perfectly coherent, provided they have the same frequency and a constant phase difference. They will interfere, but the destructive interference will not result in complete cancellation (zero amplitude)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_29.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "29 the diagram shows a screen that is a distance l from a diffraction grating. the grating has a total\nnumber of n lines. any two adjacent lines are a distance d apart. a beam of parallel light of\nwavelength j is incident normally on the grating.\n\nscreen\nnot to\ndiffraction scale\ngrating\nbeat first-order maxima\nof light \"\n| f\nwhich quantities affect the distance between the first-order diffraction maxima on the screen?\npopa pate tn\na v v v x key\nb v jv x x / = affects the distance\ncc v x v v x = does not affect the distance\nd x v x v", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer: A\n\nThe position of the principal maxima in a diffraction pattern is determined by the diffraction grating equation:  \n**d sin(\u03b8) = n\u03bb**\n\nwhere:\n*   **d** is the distance between adjacent lines (slits) on the grating.\n*   **\u03b8** is the angle of diffraction for a specific maximum, measured from the central axis.\n*   **n** is the order of the maximum (for the first-order maxima, n = 1).\n*   **\u03bb** is the wavelength of the incident light.\n\nFrom this equation, we can find the angle for the first-order maximum (n=1):\n**sin(\u03b8) = \u03bb / d**\n\nThe distance of this maximum from the central axis on the screen, let's call it `y`, can be found using trigonometry.

For a fixed angle **\u03b8**, the distance `y` from the central axis is given by `y = L tan(\u03b8)`. This shows a direct proportionality between `y` and `L`. If the screen is moved further away (increasing **L**), the light rays have more distance to spread out, and the separation between the maxima will increase.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it claims that the wavelength **\u03bb** does not affect the distance. According to the grating equation, `d sin(\u03b8) = n\u03bb`, the angle of diffraction **\u03b8** is directly dependent on the wavelength **\u03bb**. A longer wavelength will be diffracted through a larger angle, resulting in a greater separation between the maxima on the screen. Secondly, it claims that the total number of lines **N** does affect the distance. The position of the maxima is determined by the condition for constructive interference between adjacent slits, which depends on the slit separation **d**, not the total number of slits **N**. While **N** influences the sharpness of the interference pattern, it does not alter the positions of the principal maxima.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it claims that **d** and **L** do not affect the distance, while **N** does. As established from the grating equation `d sin(\u03b8) = n\u03bb`, the slit separation **d** is inversely proportional to `sin(\u03b8)`. A smaller `d` (more lines per unit length) will cause a larger angle of diffraction **\u03b8**, increasing the separation of the maxima. As explained for option B, the distance to the screen **L** is directly proportional to the separation of the maxima. Finally, as explained for option C, the total number of lines **N** affects the sharpness of the maxima, not their location. Therefore, this option incorrectly identifies which quantities affect the distance."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_30.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 awire carries a current of 0.10 ua. the potential difference across the wire is 10 mv.\nhow much energy is dissipated by the wire in a time of 10s?\na 1.0pj b 10pj c 1.0nj d 10nj", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe energy dissipated in a component is given by the product of the potential difference across it, the current flowing through it, and the time for which the current flows.

When a potential difference (V) is applied across the filament, a current (I) flows, causing the filament to heat up. The relationship between resistance and temperature for a metallic conductor, such as the tungsten filament, is that resistance increases as temperature increases.\n\nTherefore, as the potential difference V across the lamp is increased, the current I also increases. This larger current causes the filament's temperature to rise significantly, which in turn increases its resistance. According to Ohm's Law (V = IR), an increasing resistance means that for a given increment in V, the resulting increase in I will be smaller.\n\nThis relationship is represented by a curve on an I-V graph that starts at the origin and bends towards the voltage axis. The gradient of an I-V graph represents the change in current per unit change in voltage (dI/dV), which is the reciprocal of the dynamic resistance. As V increases, the resistance increases, so the gradient of the curve must decrease. Graph B correctly shows this characteristic: the slope is steep at low voltages (low temperature, low resistance) and becomes progressively shallower at higher voltages (high temperature, high resistance).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**A:** This graph shows that as the potential difference V increases, the current I increases at an accelerating rate. The gradient of the curve (dI/dV) is increasing. This implies that the resistance of the component is decreasing as the voltage and current increase. This is the characteristic behavior of a component like a thermistor (specifically an NTC type), not a filament lamp.\n\n**C:** This graph shows a straight line passing through the origin, which indicates a direct proportionality between current I and potential difference V (I \u221d V). This is characteristic of an ohmic conductor, for which the resistance (R = V/I) is constant, as described by Ohm's Law. A filament lamp is a non-ohmic device because its resistance changes significantly with temperature.\n\n**D:** This graph shows that almost no current flows until the potential difference reaches a specific threshold value, after which the current increases very sharply. This is the characteristic I-V graph for a forward-biased semiconductor diode. A filament lamp is a metallic conductor and allows current to flow as soon as a potential difference is applied, without such a threshold voltage."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_33.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "33 the table shows the properties of two different wires, p and q.\nlength resistance base wiby\nof material\nwire p l r p\nwire q 21 +r tp\nwire p has a cross-section of diameter d.\nwhat is the diameter of the cross-section of wire q?\na 0.41d b 1.6d c 2.7d d 7.1d", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe relationship between resistance (R), resistivity (\u03c1), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) of a wire is given by the formula:\nR = \u03c1L / A\n\nThe cross-sectional area (A) is related to the diameter (d) by:\nA = \u03c0(d/2)\u00b2 = (\u03c0/4)d\u00b2\n\nSubstituting the area formula into the resistance formula gives:\nR = \u03c1L / (\u03c0d\u00b2/4)  or  R = 4\u03c1L / (\u03c0d\u00b2)\n\nWe can write this equation for both wire P and wire Q.\n\nFor wire P:\nR_P = R = 4\u03c1l / (\u03c0d_P\u00b2)\nGiven d_P = d, so:\nR = 4\u03c1l / (\u03c0d\u00b2)  (Equation 1)\n\nFor wire Q:\nR_Q = (1/4)R\nL_Q = 2l\n\u03c1_Q = (1/3)\u03c1\nSo, (1/4)R = 4((1/3)\u03c1)(2l) / (\u03c0d_Q\u00b2)\n(1/4)R = (8/3)\u03c1l / (\u03c0d_Q\u00b2)  (Equation 2)\n\nTo find the diameter of wire Q (d_Q) in terms of d, we can take the ratio of Equation 2 to Equation 1:\n[(1/4)R] / R = [(8/3)\u03c1l / (\u03c0d_Q\u00b2)] / [4\u03c1l / (\u03c0d\u00b2)]\n\nSimplifying this expression by cancelling common terms (R, \u03c1, l, \u03c0, 4):\n1/4 = [(8/3) / d_Q\u00b2] / [4 / d\u00b2]\n1/4 = (8/3) * (1/d_Q\u00b2) * (d\u00b2/4)\n1/4 = (8d\u00b2) / (12d_Q\u00b2)\n1/4 = (2d\u00b2) / (3d_Q\u00b2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for d_Q\u00b2:\n3d_Q\u00b2 = 4 * (2d\u00b2)\n3d_Q\u00b2 = 8d\u00b2\nd_Q\u00b2 = (8/3)d\u00b2\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find d_Q:\nd_Q = \u221a(8/3) * d\nd_Q \u2248 1.633 * d\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the cross-section of wire Q is approximately 1.6d.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A. 0.41d\nThis answer may be obtained by incorrectly setting up the proportionality. The correct relationship is d\u00b2 \u221d \u03c1L/R. An incorrect relationship, such as d\u00b2 \u221d \u03c1L*R, would lead to d_Q\u00b2/d\u00b2 = (\u03c1_Q/\u03c1_P) * (L_Q/L_P) * (R_Q/R_P) = (1/3) * (2) * (1/4) = 1/6. Taking the square root, d_Q/d = \u221a(1/6) \u2248 0.41. This is incorrect because resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (and thus d\u00b2), not directly proportional.\n\n#### C. 2.7d\nThis result arises from a common misconception about the relationship between area and diameter. The calculation correctly finds the ratio of the areas, A_Q / A_P = 8/3.

The e.m.f. represents the total energy supplied per unit charge by the cell. When connected to an external variable resistor (R), the total resistance in the circuit is R + r.\n\nThe current (I) flowing in the circuit is given by Ohm's law for the entire circuit: I = \u03b5 / (R + r).\n\nWhen the resistance of the variable resistor (R) is decreased, the total resistance of the circuit (R + r) also decreases. Since the e.m.f. (\u03b5) is constant, a decrease in the total resistance causes the current (I) drawn from the cell to increase.\n\nThe terminal potential difference (p.d.), V, is the potential difference across the external resistor, which is also the p.d. across the terminals of the cell. It is related to the e.m.f. by the equation:\nV = \u03b5 - Ir\n\nThis equation shows that the terminal p.d. is the e.m.f. minus the potential difference lost across the internal resistance, which is known as the \"lost volts\" (Ir). The lost volts represent the energy dissipated per unit charge within the cell due to its internal resistance. This energy dissipation is equivalent to the work done in moving a unit charge through the internal resistance.\n\nSince the current (I) increases and the internal resistance (r) is constant, the lost volts (Ir) increase. This means more work is done per unit charge to move it through the internal resistance. As a result, in the equation V = \u03b5 - Ir, a larger value (Ir) is subtracted from the constant e.m.f.

While the terminal p.d. does decrease, the cause is an increase in current, not a decrease. According to the formula I = \u03b5 / (R + r), decreasing the external resistance R leads to a decrease in the total resistance (R + r), which in turn causes the current (I) to increase.\n\n**C: The terminal p.d. is increased because more work is done moving unit charge through the variable resistor.**\nThis statement is incorrect in both its claim and its reasoning. As established, decreasing the external resistance causes the terminal p.d. to decrease, not increase. The reasoning that \"more work is done moving unit charge through the variable resistor\" is equivalent to saying the terminal p.d. (V = Work/charge) increases. This is a restatement of the incorrect claim, not a valid physical explanation for it.\n\n**D: The terminal p.d. is increased because the current in the variable resistor is increased.**\nThis statement incorrectly concludes that the terminal p.d. increases. Although the reason provided, \"the current... is increased,\" is factually correct, it leads to the wrong outcome. The relationship V = \u03b5 - Ir shows that an increase in current (I) leads to a larger value for the \"lost volts\" (Ir). Subtracting this larger value from the constant e.m.f.

This p.d. can be calculated for the lower branch, as both the current (I\u2082) and resistance (R\u2082) are known.\n    Using Ohm's law, V = IR:\n    Terminal p.d., V_T = I\u2082 \u00d7 R\u2082 = 0.48 A \u00d7 15 \u03a9 = 7.2 V.\n\n2.  **Calculate the unknown resistance R.**\n    This terminal p.d. of 7.2 V is also the p.d. across the upper branch. The total resistance of the upper branch is (R + 2.0 \u03a9), and the current flowing through it (I\u2081) is 0.45 A.\n    Applying Ohm's law to the upper branch:\n    V_T = I\u2081 \u00d7 (R + 2.0 \u03a9)\n    7.2 V = 0.45 A \u00d7 (R + 2.0 \u03a9)\n    Rearranging to find the total resistance of the upper branch:\n    (R + 2.0 \u03a9) = 7.2 V / 0.45 A = 16 \u03a9\n    Therefore, R = 16 \u03a9 - 2.0 \u03a9 = 14 \u03a9.\n\n3.  **Calculate the internal resistance r.**\n    First, find the total current (I_total) supplied by the battery. According to Kirchhoff's current law, the total current is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches:\n    I_total = I\u2081 + I\u2082 = 0.45 A + 0.48 A = 0.93 A.\n    The relationship between the battery's e.m.f.

The error arises from a miscalculation of the resistance R. The potential difference across the parallel combination is determined by the lower branch: V_T = 0.48 A \u00d7 15 \u03a9 = 7.2 V. This same potential difference exists across the upper branch. The total resistance of the upper branch is therefore V_T / I\u2081 = 7.2 V / 0.45 A = 16 \u03a9. Since this branch consists of R and a 2.0 \u03a9 resistor in series, R is calculated as 16 \u03a9 - 2.0 \u03a9 = 14 \u03a9. The value of 20 \u03a9 is incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for the incorrect answer (C)\n\nThis option incorrectly states that r = 5.8 \u03a9, although the value for R = 14 \u03a9 is correct. The error is in the calculation of the internal resistance, r. The internal resistance is found using the formula r = (E - V_T) / I_total. The total current, I_total, is the sum of the branch currents (0.45 A + 0.48 A = 0.93 A). The terminal p.d., V_T, is 7.2 V. The calculation should be r = (10 V - 7.2 V) / 0.93 A \u2248 3.0 \u03a9. The value of 5.8 \u03a9 likely results from incorrectly using only one of the branch currents instead of the total current in the calculation. For instance, using the current from the lower branch (0.48 A): (10 V - 7.2 V) / 0.48 A \u2248 5.8 \u03a9. This is incorrect because the \"lost volts\" are due to the total current from the battery flowing through the internal resistance.\n\n### Explanation for the incorrect answer (D)\n\nThis option provides incorrect values for both r and R.

The first step is to determine the e.m.f. (electromotive force) of the battery using the initial conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the battery e.m.f.**\nAt a temperature of 20.0 \u00b0C, the thermistor's resistance (R_th) is 12.0 k\u03a9, and the fixed resistor's resistance (R_fixed) is also 12.0 k\u03a9. The potential difference across the fixed resistor (V_out) is given as 4.50 V.\n\nThe total resistance in the circuit is R_total = R_th + R_fixed = 12.0 k\u03a9 + 12.0 k\u03a9 = 24.0 k\u03a9.\n\nAccording to the potential divider principle, the output voltage is given by:\nV_out = V_battery * (R_fixed / (R_th + R_fixed))\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the battery's e.m.f. (V_battery):\nV_battery = V_out * ((R_th + R_fixed) / R_fixed)\nV_battery = 4.50 V * ((12.0 k\u03a9 + 12.0 k\u03a9) / 12.0 k\u03a9)\nV_battery = 4.50 V * (24.0 k\u03a9 / 12.0 k\u03a9)\nV_battery = 4.50 V * 2 = 9.00 V\n\n**Step 2: Calculate V_out at the new temperature.**\nWhen the temperature rises to 50.0 \u00b0C, the thermistor's resistance changes to R_th = 5.00 k\u03a9. The fixed resistance (R_fixed = 12.0 k\u03a9) and the battery e.m.f. (V_battery = 9.00 V) remain constant.\n\nThe new total resistance is R_total = 5.00 k\u03a9 + 12.0 k\u03a9 = 17.0 k\u03a9.\n\nNow, we calculate the new V_out using the potential divider formula with the new values:\nV_out = V_battery * (R_fixed / (R_th + R_fixed))\nV_out = 9.00 V * (12.0 k\u03a9 / (5.00 k\u03a9 + 12.0 k\u03a9))\nV_out = 9.00 V * (12.0 k\u03a9 / 17.0 k\u03a9)\nV_out \u2248 6.3529 V\n\nRounding to three significant figures, V_out = 6.35 V.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 2.65 V**\nThis value is obtained if one calculates the potential difference across the thermistor instead of the fixed resistor at 50.0 \u00b0C. The voltage across the thermistor would be V_th = 9.00 V * (5.00 k\u03a9 / (5.00 k\u03a9 + 12.0 k\u03a9)) = 9.00 V * (5.00 / 17.0) \u2248 2.65 V. The question, however, asks for V_out, which is the potential difference across the fixed resistor.\n\n**B: 3.18 V**\nThis incorrect answer results from a flawed proportional reasoning. It assumes that the output voltage is directly proportional to the total resistance of the circuit. The calculation would be: V_out_new = V_out_old * (R_total_new / R_total_old) = 4.50 V * (17.0 k\u03a9 / 24.0 k\u03a9) \u2248 3.19 V. This is incorrect because the output voltage across the fixed resistor is inversely proportional to the total resistance (V_out = (V_battery * R_fixed) / R_total), not directly proportional.\n\n**D: 10.8 V**\nThis answer is physically impossible because the potential difference across a single component in a series circuit cannot exceed the total e.m.f. of the power supply (which was calculated to be 9.00 V). This error might arise from an incorrect application of ratios, for example, by assuming V_out is inversely proportional only to the thermistor's resistance: V_out_new = V_out_old * (R_th_old / R_th_new) = 4.50 V * (12.0 k\u03a9 / 5.00 k\u03a9) = 10.8 V.

The nucleus contains most of the mass of the atom.**\n\nThis is a fundamental conclusion derived from the alpha-particle scattering experiment (also known as the Geiger-Marsden or Rutherford's gold foil experiment). The key observation that supports this conclusion is that while most alpha particles passed through the gold foil with little or no deflection, a very small fraction (approximately 1 in 8000) were deflected at very large angles, with some even scattering backwards.\n\nAlpha particles are relatively massive (composed of two protons and two neutrons) and were fired at high velocity. The fact that they could be repelled and turned back implies a collision with an object that is even more massive and densely packed. If the mass of the atom were spread out evenly, as in the \"plum pudding\" model, the alpha particles would not encounter anything massive enough to cause such a dramatic change in their trajectory. Therefore, the experiment demonstrated that the atom must have a very small, dense, positively charged core\u2014the nucleus\u2014where almost all of its mass is concentrated.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Protons and electrons have equal but opposite charges.**\n\nWhile this statement is a correct fact in physics, it was not a conclusion drawn from the alpha-particle scattering experiment. The discovery of the electron and its negative charge is credited to J.J. Thomson's experiments with cathode rays (1897). The precise measurement of the elementary charge, which allowed for the comparison between the electron's and proton's charge, was famously conducted by Robert Millikan in his oil drop experiment (1909). Rutherford's experiment established that the nucleus has a positive charge, but it did not determine the fundamental charges of individual protons and electrons.\n\n**B. Protons have a much larger mass than electrons.**\n\nThis statement is also a correct physical fact, but it was not established by the alpha-particle scattering experiment. The mass-to-charge ratio of the electron was first measured by J.J. Thomson. Combining this with the known elementary charge from Millikan's experiment allowed for the calculation of the electron's mass. The mass of the proton was determined through other means. The alpha-scattering experiment indicated that the nucleus as a whole was massive, but it did not provide a direct comparison between the masses of the individual subatomic particles (protons and electrons).\n\n**D. The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons.**\n\nThe alpha-particle scattering experiment, conducted around 1909, led to Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus and its positive charge, which he later attributed to protons. However, the neutron, the neutral particle in the nucleus, was not discovered until 1932 by James Chadwick. Therefore, the conclusion that the nucleus contains neutrons could not have been made from the original alpha-scattering experiment, as the existence of the neutron was unknown at the time."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_39.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "39 americium-241 is a radioactive nuclide used in smoke detectors. it undergoes o-decay to form\nnuclide x. this decay may be represented by the equation shown.\n\u201cam > 3x + 0\nwhat are the values of a and z?\npf a | zz\na 237 93\nb 239 91\ncc 241 94\nd 241 96", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn any nuclear decay, both the total mass number (A) and the total atomic number (Z) must be conserved. This means the sum of these numbers for the reactants must equal the sum for the products.\n\nThe decay process described is alpha decay. An alpha particle (\u03b1) is a helium nucleus, which has a mass number of 4 and an atomic number of 2.

For an alpha decay (emission of a \u2074\u2082He particle), the mass number of the parent nuclide must decrease by 4, and the atomic number must decrease by 2. This would result in A = 241 - 4 = 237 and Z = 95 - 2 = 93. The values A = 239 and Z = 91 do not satisfy these conditions.\n\n#### C) A=241, Z=94\nThis option is incorrect. In an alpha decay, the mass number must decrease by 4 due to the emission of the four nucleons in the alpha particle. This option incorrectly suggests the mass number A remains unchanged at 241. Furthermore, the atomic number Z should decrease by 2, not by 1 (from 95 to 94). Thus, both the conservation of mass number and the conservation of atomic number are violated.\n\n#### D) A=241, Z=96\nThis option is incorrect as it violates both conservation laws for alpha decay. The mass number A should decrease by 4, not remain constant at 241. The atomic number Z should decrease by 2, whereas this option suggests an increase from 95 to 96.

These components are related to the launch angle by the following trigonometric relationships:\nv\u2093 = v cos(\u03b8)\nv\u1d67 = v sin(\u03b8)\nwhere v is the magnitude of the initial velocity.\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can establish a direct relationship between the vertical and horizontal components:\nv\u1d67 / v\u2093 = (v sin(\u03b8)) / (v cos(\u03b8)) = tan(\u03b8)\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the vertical component, v\u1d67:\nv\u1d67 = v\u2093 tan(\u03b8)\n\nGiven the horizontal component v\u2093 = 13 m s\u207b\u00b9 and the launch angle \u03b8 = 25\u00b0, we can calculate the vertical component:\nv\u1d67 = 13 \u00d7 tan(25\u00b0)\nv\u1d67 \u2248 13 \u00d7 0.4663\nv\u1d67 \u2248 6.06 m s\u207b\u00b9\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives 6.1 m s\u207b\u00b9, which corresponds to option B.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 5.5 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis answer is obtained by incorrectly calculating the vertical component using the sine of the angle multiplied by the horizontal component of velocity: 13 \u00d7 sin(25\u00b0) \u2248 5.5 m s\u207b\u00b9. The correct formula for the vertical component is v\u1d67 = v sin(\u03b8), where 'v' is the magnitude of the total initial velocity, not the horizontal component. The correct relationship between the two components involves the tangent function, as shown in the correct explanation (v\u1d67 = v\u2093 tan(\u03b8)).\n\n**C: 12 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly multiplying the horizontal component of velocity by the cosine of the angle: 13 \u00d7 cos(25\u00b0) \u2248 11.8 m s\u207b\u00b9, which rounds to 12 m s\u207b\u00b9.

The horizontal component is related to the cosine of the angle (v\u2093 = v cos(\u03b8)), while the vertical component is related to the sine of the angle (v\u1d67 = v sin(\u03b8)). This calculation effectively attempts to find a component of a component, which is physically incorrect in this context.\n\n**D: 14 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value represents the approximate magnitude of the total initial velocity (v), not its vertical component. The total initial velocity can be calculated from the horizontal component and the launch angle using the formula v = v\u2093 / cos(\u03b8).

Acceleration is a vector quantity that quantifies the rate at which an object's velocity changes. The formula for average acceleration is given by:\n\n*   **a = \u0394v / \u0394t**\n\nWhere:\n*   **a** is acceleration.\n*   **\u0394v** is the change in velocity (final velocity minus initial velocity).\n*   **\u0394t** is the time interval over which the change occurs.\n\nThe phrase \"change in velocity per unit time\" is a direct verbal representation of this fundamental kinematic equation, \u0394v/\u0394t.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. rate of change of speed per unit time**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, it is redundant; the term \"rate of change\" already implies a division by a unit of time. Saying \"rate of change per unit time\" is tautological. Secondly, and more importantly, acceleration is defined in terms of **velocity**, not **speed**. Velocity is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction, whereas speed is a scalar quantity, having only magnitude. An object can accelerate even if its speed is constant, provided its direction of motion is changing (for example, an object in uniform circular motion). A definition based on speed is therefore incomplete.\n\n**C. rate of change of velocity per unit time**\n\nThis statement is incorrect due to redundancy. The phrase \"rate of change of velocity\" is, by itself, the definition of acceleration. Adding the term \"per unit time\" to this phrase would imply dividing acceleration by time (a/t). This new quantity would represent the rate at which acceleration itself is changing, a concept known as \"jerk\" in physics, and is not the definition of acceleration.\n\n**D. resultant force per unit mass**\n\nThis statement describes Newton's Second Law of Motion, which can be rearranged as **a = F / m** (acceleration equals resultant force divided by mass). While this is a fundamental physical law that relates force, mass, and acceleration, it is not the *definition* of acceleration. The definition of acceleration is kinematic, meaning it describes motion without reference to its causes. In contrast, Newton's Second Law is dynamic, as it explains the cause of acceleration (a resultant force).

In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects stick together and move with a common final velocity. While momentum is conserved in such a collision, a significant amount of kinetic energy is converted into other forms (like heat and sound). The problem specifies a perfectly elastic collision, where kinetic energy is conserved.\n\n#### Option C\nThis option is incorrect because, similar to option A, it does not conserve kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Initial Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   KE_initial = 0.97*m* (as calculated previously).\n*   **Final Kinetic Energy (Option C):** Let the direction to the right be positive.\n    *   KE_final = \u00bd*m*(-0.19)\u00b2 + \u00bd*m*(0.99)\u00b2 = \u00bd*m*(0.0361 + 0.9801) = 0.5081*m*\n\nThe final kinetic energy (0.5081*m*) is less than the initial kinetic energy (0.97*m*).

It states that the upthrust on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The formula for upthrust (U) is U = \u03c1Vg, where \u03c1 is the density of the fluid, V is the volume of the submerged part of the object, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nIn this scenario, the ball is fully submerged and falling through a liquid of uniform density. This means that \u03c1 (the liquid's density) is constant. The volume of the ball (V) and the acceleration due to gravity (g) are also constant. Since all the variables in the formula for upthrust are constant, the upthrust itself remains constant, regardless of the ball's depth in the liquid.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. The drag force increases with increasing depth.**\nThe drag force is a type of fluid friction that opposes the motion of an object through a fluid. Its magnitude depends on factors such as the object's speed, size, and shape, as well as the fluid's density and viscosity. It does not depend on the depth of the object in the fluid. The problem states that the ball is falling at a *constant speed*. Because the speed is constant, the drag force acting on the ball is also constant.\n\n**B. The drag force is equal to the sum of the upthrust and weight.**\nThe problem states the ball falls at a *constant speed*. According to Newton's First Law, an object moving at a constant velocity has zero net force acting on it. The forces acting on the ball are its weight (acting downwards) and the upthrust and drag force (both acting upwards, opposing the motion). For the net force to be zero, the total upward force must equal the total downward force. Therefore, the correct relationship is:\nWeight = Upthrust + Drag force.\nThe statement \"Drag force = Upthrust + Weight\" is incorrect as it misrepresents this force balance.\n\n**D. The weight is greater than the sum of the drag force and the upthrust.**\nIf the weight were greater than the sum of the upthrust and the drag force, there would be a net downward force on the ball (Net Force = Weight - (Upthrust + Drag force) > 0). According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), a net force would cause the ball to accelerate downwards. This contradicts the information given in the problem that the ball is falling at a *constant speed* (i.e., with zero acceleration). For the speed to be constant, the forces must be balanced: Weight = Upthrust + Drag force."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_51.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "11 some small solid cubes each have mass 1.0kg and sides of length 5.0cm. these small cubes\nare stacked together to form a large solid cube with sides of length 2.0m.\nwhat is the weight of the large cube?\na 0.39kn b  0.39mn c 0.63mn d 0.63gn", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe weight of an object is the product of its mass and the acceleration of free fall, g (W = mg).

The pressure exerted by a fluid column is calculated using the formula P = \u03c1gh, where \u03c1 is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration of free fall (taken as 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2), and h is the vertical depth of the fluid column.\n\nLet the depth of the oil be *x*.\nThe total depth of the borehole is 2000 m, so the depth of the water is (2000 - *x*) m.\n\nThe total pressure, P_total, is the sum of the pressure from the oil (P_oil) and the pressure from the water (P_water):\nP_total = P_oil + P_water\nP_total = (\u03c1_oil \u00d7 g \u00d7 *x*) + (\u03c1_water \u00d7 g \u00d7 (2000 - *x*))\n\nThe given values are:\nP_total = 17.5 MPa = 17.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa\n\u03c1_oil = 830 kg m\u207b\u00b3\n\u03c1_water = 1000 kg m\u207b\u00b3\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n17.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 = (830 \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 *x*) + (1000 \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 (2000 - *x*))\n\nTo simplify, we can factor out g (9.81):\n17.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 = 9.81 \u00d7 [830*x* + 1000(2000 - *x*)]\n\nDivide by 9.81 and expand the bracket:\n17.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 / 9.81 = 830*x* + 2,000,000 - 1000*x*\n1,783,894 = 2,000,000 - 170*x*\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for *x*:\n170*x* = 2,000,000 - 1,783,894\n170*x* = 216,106\n*x* = 216,106 / 170\n*x* \u2248 1271 m\n\nThe calculated value of 1271 m is closest to 1270 m, with the small difference likely due to rounding during intermediate steps or the precision of the given options. Thus, 1270 m is the correct depth of the oil.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option is incorrect. To verify, one can calculate the total pressure that would result from an oil depth of *x* = 907 m. If the oil depth is 907 m, the water depth would be 2000 m - 907 m = 1093 m.\n\nUsing the pressure formula P_total = (\u03c1_oil \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_oil) + (\u03c1_water \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_water):\nP_total = (830 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 907 m) + (1000 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 1093 m)\nP_total = 7,380,351 Pa + 10,722,330 Pa\nP_total = 18,102,681 Pa \u2248 18.1 MPa\n\nThis calculated pressure of 18.1 MPa does not match the given pressure of 17.5 MPa. Therefore, an oil depth of 907 m is incorrect. This result likely arises from a calculation error or a mistake in setting up the initial equation, for instance, misinterpreting one of the given values.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect. An oil depth of 1000 m would imply that the water depth is also 1000 m (since the total depth is 2000 m). This is a simple division of the total depth, but it does not account for the different densities of the liquids and the resulting total pressure.\n\nLet's calculate the total pressure for *x* = 1000 m:\nP_total = (\u03c1_oil \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_oil) + (\u03c1_water \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_water)\nP_total = (830 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 1000 m) + (1000 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 1000 m)\nP_total = 8,142,300 Pa + 9,810,000 Pa\nP_total = 17,952,300 Pa \u2248 18.0 MPa\n\nThe resulting pressure of approximately 18.0 MPa is not equal to the given total pressure of 17.5 MPa. Therefore, the depth of the oil cannot be 1000 m.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect. If the depth of the oil, *x*, were 1090 m, the depth of the water would be 2000 m - 1090 m = 910 m. We can calculate the total pressure for these depths to check the validity of this option.\n\nUsing the pressure formula P_total = (\u03c1_oil \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_oil) + (\u03c1_water \u00d7 g \u00d7 h_water):\nP_total = (830 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 1090 m) + (1000 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 910 m)\nP_total = 8,875,170 Pa + 8,927,100 Pa\nP_total = 17,802,270 Pa \u2248 17.8 MPa\n\nThis calculated pressure of 17.8 MPa is not the same as the given pressure of 17.5 MPa. Therefore, an oil depth of 1090 m is incorrect. This value might be obtained if one incorrectly calculates the depth of the water and solves for the oil depth, or makes another algebraic error."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_53.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13 a rod is pivoted at one end. initially the angle @ of the rod to the horizontal is 0\u00b0.\nthe weight of the rod causes a moment m about the pivot.\nthe rod is then rotated in the vertical plane so that the angle @ of the rod increases from 0\u00b0 to\n180\u00b0.\nwhich graph shows the variation of m with 0?\na b\nm m\n0 0\n0 90\u00b0 180\u00b0 0 go\u00b0 180\u00b0\na) a)\ncc d\nm m\n0 0\n0 90\u00b0 180\u00b0 0 90 180\u00b0\n| |", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (D)\n\nThe moment (or torque) *M* about a pivot is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force. In this case, the force is the weight *W* of the rod, which acts vertically downwards through its center of mass. For a uniform rod of length *L*, the center of mass is at its midpoint, a distance *L*/2 from the pivot.\n\nThe angle *\u03b8* is the angle the rod makes with the horizontal. The perpendicular distance (*d*) from the pivot to the vertical line of action of the weight is the horizontal component of the position of the center of mass. Using trigonometry, this distance is given by:\n*d* = (*L*/2) cos(*\u03b8*)\n\nTherefore, the moment *M* is:\n*M* = Force \u00d7 Perpendicular distance = *W* \u00d7 (*L*/2) cos(*\u03b8*)\n\nSince *W* and *L* are constant, the moment *M* is directly proportional to cos(*\u03b8*). We can analyze the value of *M* as *\u03b8* varies from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0:\n*   **At *\u03b8* = 0\u00b0** (rod is horizontal): cos(0\u00b0) = 1. The moment is at its maximum positive value, *M* = *W*(*L*/2).\n*   **At *\u03b8* = 90\u00b0** (rod is vertical): cos(90\u00b0) = 0. The moment is zero, as the line of action of the weight passes through the pivot.\n*   **At *\u03b8* = 180\u00b0** (rod is horizontal, but rotated 180\u00b0): cos(180\u00b0) = -1. The moment is at its maximum negative value, *M* = -*W*(*L*/2). The negative sign indicates that the turning effect is now in the opposite direction.\n\nThe graph of *M* against *\u03b8* is therefore a cosine curve. It starts at a maximum positive value, decreases to zero at 90\u00b0, and becomes a maximum negative value at 180\u00b0. Graph D correctly depicts this relationship.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n#### A\nThis graph shows the moment *M* remaining constant as the angle *\u03b8* increases. This would imply that the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the weight is constant. However, as the rod rotates, this perpendicular distance, given by (*L*/2)cos(*\u03b8*), changes. Therefore, the moment is not constant.\n\n#### B\nThis graph shows the magnitude of the moment, which is always positive or zero. It correctly shows that the magnitude is maximum at 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 and zero at 90\u00b0. However, moment is a vector quantity, and its direction is crucial. When the rod rotates past the vertical position (*\u03b8* > 90\u00b0), the weight acts on the other side of the pivot, causing a moment in the opposite direction. This change in direction should be represented by a change in the sign of *M* (from positive to negative). Graph B fails to show this.\n\n#### C\nThis graph shows a linear relationship between the moment *M* and the angle *\u03b8*. The relationship derived from the principles of mechanics is *M* \u221d cos(*\u03b8*), which is a trigonometric function, not a linear one. Although this graph correctly shows the moment being zero at *\u03b8* = 90\u00b0 and changing sign, the straight-line variation is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_54.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 a hinged trapdoor is held closed in the horizontal position by a cable.\nthree forces act on the trapdoor: the weight w of the door, the tension 7 in the cable and the\nforce h at the hinge.\ncable\nwall t\ntrapdoor\nhinge\nh\nww\n\nwhich list gives the three forces in increasing order of magnitude?\na h,t,w b t,h,w c wh,t d w,t,h", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe trapdoor is in static equilibrium, which means two conditions are met:\n1.  **Translational Equilibrium:** The net force acting on the trapdoor is zero. This implies the vector sum of all forces is zero ( **W** + **T** + **H** = 0), and consequently, the sum of the components of the forces in any direction is zero.\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The net torque (or moment) about any point is zero. This means the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments about any chosen pivot.\n\nWe can determine the relative magnitudes of the forces by applying these principles.\n\n**1. Comparing Tension (T) and Weight (W) using Moments:**\n\nLet's consider moments about the hinge. The force at the hinge **H** passes through this pivot point, so its moment is zero, which simplifies the analysis.\n\n*   The weight **W** acts downwards at the centre of mass of the door, creating a clockwise moment. Let the distance from the hinge to the centre of mass be *d<sub>W</sub>*. The clockwise moment is M<sub>cw</sub> = *W* \u00d7 *d<sub>W</sub>*.\n*   The tension **T** acts along the cable at an angle *\u03b8* to the horizontal. Only its vertical component, *T* sin(*\u03b8*), produces a moment about the hinge. This creates an anticlockwise moment. Let the distance from the hinge to the point where the cable is attached be *d<sub>T</sub>*. The anticlockwise moment is M<sub>acw</sub> = (*T* sin *\u03b8*) \u00d7 *d<sub>T</sub>*.\n\nFor rotational equilibrium, M<sub>cw</sub> = M<sub>acw</sub>:\n*W* \u00d7 *d<sub>W</sub>* = *T* sin(*\u03b8*) \u00d7 *d<sub>T</sub>*\n\nRearranging for *T*:\n*T* = *W* \u00d7 (*d<sub>W</sub>* / *d<sub>T</sub>*) \u00d7 (1 / sin *\u03b8*)\n\nFrom the diagram:\n*   The weight **W** acts at the centre of the uniform door, while the cable is attached closer to the hinge. Thus, the lever arm for the weight is greater than the lever arm for the tension (*d<sub>W</sub>* > *d<sub>T</sub>*). This makes the ratio (*d<sub>W</sub>* / *d<sub>T</sub>*) greater than 1.\n*   The angle *\u03b8* is acute (0\u00b0 < *\u03b8* < 90\u00b0), so sin(*\u03b8*) is less than 1. This makes the factor (1 / sin *\u03b8*) greater than 1.\n\nSince *T* is equal to *W* multiplied by two factors that are both greater than 1, the magnitude of the tension **T** must be greater than the magnitude of the weight **W** (*T* > *W*).\n\n**2. Comparing Tension (T) and Hinge Force (H) using Force Components:**\n\nLet's resolve the forces into horizontal and vertical components.\n*   **Horizontal components:** The tension **T** has a horizontal component *T* cos(*\u03b8*) acting to the left. For equilibrium, the hinge force **H** must have an equal and opposite horizontal component, *H<sub>x</sub>* = *T* cos(*\u03b8*), acting to the right.\n*   **Vertical components:** The tension **T** has a vertical component *T* sin(*\u03b8*) acting upwards. The weight **W** acts downwards. As established from the moment analysis, *T* sin(*\u03b8*) = *W* (*d<sub>W</sub>* / *d<sub>T</sub>*) > *W*. Since the upward force from the cable (*T* sin *\u03b8*) is greater than the downward force of the weight (*W*), the hinge must provide a downward vertical force, *H<sub>y</sub>* = *T* sin(*\u03b8*) - *W*, to maintain vertical equilibrium.\n\nNow, compare the magnitudes of **T** and **H**:\n*   The magnitude of **T** is *T*. Its vertical component is *T<sub>y</sub>* = *T* sin(*\u03b8*).\n*   The magnitude of **H** is *H* = \u221a(*H<sub>x</sub>*\u00b2 + *H<sub>y</sub>*\u00b2). Its vertical component is *H<sub>y</sub>* = *T* sin(*\u03b8*) - *W*.\n\nSince *W* > 0, the vertical component of **H** (*H<sub>y</sub>*) is smaller than the vertical component of **T** (*T<sub>y</sub>*). As both forces share the same horizontal component (*H<sub>x</sub>* = *T* cos *\u03b8*), but **T** has a larger vertical component, the magnitude of **T** must be greater than the magnitude of **H** (*T* > *H*).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have established that *T* > *W* and *T* > *H*. Therefore, **T** is the largest of the three forces. Reviewing the options, which are listed in increasing order of magnitude, only option C ends with **T**. While we have not explicitly compared *W* and *H*, the structure of the available choices allows us to identify the correct sequence. The order must be W, H, T.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A: H, T, W**: This list implies that *W* is the largest force. Our analysis showed that *T* > *W*, so this option is incorrect.\n*   **B: T, H, W**: This list implies that *T* is the smallest force and *W* is the largest. This contradicts our finding that *T* is the largest force (*T* > *W*). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **D: W, T, H**: This list implies that *H* is the largest force.

Mathematically, this is expressed as F = \u0394p / \u0394t, where F is the resultant force, \u0394p is the change in momentum, and \u0394t is the time interval over which this change occurs. This definition is the most general form of the law, as it applies to systems where mass may not be constant, such as a rocket expelling fuel.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the product of mass and acceleration**\n\nThis statement describes the equation F = ma, which is a common and highly useful application of Newton's Second Law. However, it is not the fundamental definition of force. This equation is a special case derived from the definition F = \u0394p / \u0394t, under the condition that the mass (m) of the object remains constant. When mass is constant, the change in momentum (\u0394p = \u0394(mv)) becomes m\u0394v, and the rate of change of momentum becomes m(\u0394v/\u0394t). Since acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity (\u0394v/\u0394t), this simplifies to F = ma. Because this relationship is only valid for constant mass, it is considered a consequence of the more general definition, not the definition itself.\n\n**B: the product of mass and velocity**\n\nThe product of an object's mass and its velocity (p = mv) is the definition of linear momentum, not force. Force is the quantity that causes a change in an object's momentum. The two quantities are related but distinct; force is the cause, and the change in momentum is the effect. They also have different SI units: force is measured in newtons (N or kg\u22c5m\u22c5s\u207b\u00b2), while momentum is measured in kilogram-metres per second (kg\u22c5m\u22c5s\u207b\u00b9).\n\n**D: the rate of transfer of energy**\n\nThe rate of transfer of energy, or the rate at which work is done, is the definition of power (P). Power is measured in watts (W), where 1 W = 1 joule per second. While force is related to power (for example, P = Fv, where v is the velocity in the direction of the force), it is a different physical quantity.

When a constant force acts on an object moving at a constant velocity, the power `P` is given by the product of the force and the velocity, `P = F_applied * v`.\n\nIn this scenario, the boat moves at a constant velocity `v`. According to Newton's First Law, an object moving at a constant velocity has zero net force acting upon it. This means all forces are balanced. The boat is subject to a constant drag force `F` from the water, which opposes its motion. To maintain a constant velocity, the boat's engine must provide a forward thrust force, `F_thrust`, that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the drag force.\n\nTherefore, `F_thrust = F`.\n\nThe power used by the boat's engine is the power needed to generate this thrust force. Using the formula for power:\n`P = F_thrust * v`\nSubstituting `F_thrust` with `F`:\n`P = Fv`\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1/2 Fv**\nThis expression is incorrect. The factor of 1/2 often appears in physics, for example, in the formula for kinetic energy (`1/2 mv\u00b2`) or when calculating the average power under constant acceleration from rest (`P_avg = 1/2 Fv_final`). However, in this problem, the boat is moving at a constant velocity, so the instantaneous power is required, not an average over a period of acceleration. The correct formula for power due to a constant force at a constant velocity is `P = Fv`.\n\n**C: 1/2 Fv\u00b2**\nThis expression is dimensionally incorrect for power and resembles the formula for kinetic energy, `KE = 1/2 mv\u00b2`. Power is the rate of energy transfer (measured in watts or Joules per second), while kinetic energy is a measure of energy (measured in Joules). Confusing force `F` with mass `m` or energy with power leads to this incorrect option.\n\n**D: Fv\u00b2**\nThis expression is dimensionally incorrect for power. The units of `Fv\u00b2` would be `(newtons) * (metres/second)\u00b2`, which is not a unit of power (watts or `newtons * metres/second`). While in some fluid dynamics situations, the drag force `F` is proportional to the square of the velocity (`F \u221d v\u00b2`), the power required to overcome this drag would be `P = F * v \u221d v\u00b3`.

This means there is no resultant force, and the object has no linear acceleration.\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The sum of all torques about any pivot point must be zero (\u03a3\u03c4 = 0). This means there is no resultant torque, and the object has no angular acceleration.\n\nFirst, let's analyse the forces. There are two vertical forces of magnitude *F* acting in opposite directions (one up, one down). Their resultant is *F* - *F* = 0. There are also two horizontal forces of magnitude *F* acting in opposite directions (one right, one left). Their resultant is also *F* - *F* = 0. Therefore, the total resultant force on the disc is zero. The first condition for equilibrium is met.\n\nNext, let's analyse the torques. Torque is calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force (\u03c4 = F \u00d7 r). We can choose the center of the disc as the pivot point. The distance from the center to the point of application of each force is the radius, *r*, which is half the diameter (*r* = *d*/2).\n\nLet's consider the direction of rotation, with clockwise being the positive direction for torque.\n*   The upward force on the left creates a clockwise torque: \u03c4\u2081 = *F* \u00d7 (*d*/2).\n*   The rightward force at the top creates a clockwise torque: \u03c4\u2082 = *F* \u00d7 (*d*/2).\n*   The downward force on the right creates a clockwise torque: \u03c4\u2083 = *F* \u00d7 (*d*/2).\n*   The leftward force at the bottom creates a clockwise torque: \u03c4\u2084 = *F* \u00d7 (*d*/2).\n\nAll four forces produce a torque in the same (clockwise) direction. The resultant torque is the sum of the individual torques:\n\u03a3\u03c4 = \u03c4\u2081 + \u03c4\u2082 + \u03c4\u2083 + \u03c4\u2084 = 4 \u00d7 (*F* \u00d7 *d*/2) = 2*Fd*.\n\nSince the resultant torque (2*Fd*) is not zero, the second condition for equilibrium is not met. The disc is not in rotational equilibrium and will experience a clockwise angular acceleration. Therefore, the disc is not in equilibrium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: The disc is in equilibrium because the resultant force is zero.\nThis statement is incorrect because meeting only one of the two conditions for equilibrium is insufficient. While it is true that the resultant force on the disc is zero, there is a non-zero resultant torque. For an object to be in equilibrium, both the resultant force and the resultant torque must be zero. Since the resultant torque is not zero, the disc is not in equilibrium.\n\n#### B: The disc is not in equilibrium because the resultant force is 4*F*.\nThis statement is incorrect because the reason provided is false. The resultant force is the vector sum of all forces. The upward and downward forces cancel each other out, and the leftward and rightward forces cancel each other out. Thus, the resultant force is zero, not 4*F*.

Firstly, the resultant torque is not zero. As calculated above, each of the four forces produces a clockwise torque of *F*(*d*/2) about the center, leading to a total resultant torque of 2*Fd*.

The total mechanical energy is the sum of its kinetic energy (E\u2096) and its gravitational potential energy (GPE).\n\nThe gravitational potential energy at a height *h* is given by GPE = *mgh*, where *m* is the mass of the ball and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity. The kinetic energy is denoted by E\u2096.\n\nTherefore, at any point in the path:\nTotal Energy = E\u2096 + GPE = constant\nE\u2096 + *mgh* = constant\n\nConsider two points, 1 and 2, along the path. The conservation of energy implies:\nE\u2096\u2081 + *mgh*\u2081 = E\u2096\u2082 + *mgh*\u2082\n\nRearranging this equation to find the difference in kinetic energy between the two points gives:\nE\u2096\u2081 - E\u2096\u2082 = *mgh*\u2082 - *mgh*\u2081 = *mg*(*h*\u2082 - *h*\u2081)\n\nThis equation shows that the difference in kinetic energy between two points is directly proportional to the difference in their heights. To find the smallest difference in kinetic energy, we must find the smallest difference in height between the pairs of points given in the options.\n\nLet's calculate the height differences for each option:\n*   **A: E\u2092 - E\u209b**: The relevant points are Q and S. The difference in their heights is |*h*\u209b - *h*\u2092| = |1.6 m - 1.5 m| = 0.1 m.\n*   **B: E\u209b - E\u1d63**: The relevant points are S and R. The difference in their heights is |*h*\u1d63 - *h*\u209b| = |1.8 m - 1.6 m| = 0.2 m.\n*   **C: E\u209c - E\u2092**: The relevant points are T and Q. The difference in their heights is |*h*\u2092 - *h*\u209c| = |1.5 m - 1.3 m| = 0.2 m.\n*   **D: E\u209c - E\u1d63**: The relevant points are T and R. The difference in their heights is |*h*\u1d63 - *h*\u209c| = |1.8 m - 1.3 m| = 0.5 m.\n\nComparing the height differences, the smallest is 0.1 m, which corresponds to the difference between points Q and S. Therefore, the difference in kinetic energy, E\u2092 - E\u209b, is the smallest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe difference in kinetic energy between two points in the ball's trajectory is equal to the negative of the change in its gravitational potential energy (\u0394GPE). This change in GPE is directly proportional to the change in vertical height (\u0394*h*). The relationship is given by \u0394E\u2096 = -\u0394GPE = -*mg*\u0394*h*.\n\nFor option B, the difference in kinetic energy is E\u209b - E\u1d63. Applying the conservation of energy principle:\nE\u209b + *mgh*\u209b = E\u1d63 + *mgh*\u1d63\nE\u209b - E\u1d63 = *mgh*\u1d63 - *mgh*\u209b = *mg*(*h*\u1d63 - *h*\u209b)\n\nThe heights are *h*\u1d63 = 1.8 m and *h*\u209b = 1.6 m. The difference in height is:\n\u0394*h* = 1.8 m - 1.6 m = 0.2 m.\n\nThe height difference between points Q and S (for option A) is |1.6 m - 1.5 m| = 0.1 m. Since the height difference of 0.2 m for option B is greater than the 0.1 m for option A, the corresponding difference in kinetic energy (E\u209b - E\u1d63) is also larger. Thus, this is not the smallest difference.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the change in kinetic energy (\u0394E\u2096) between two points is directly proportional to the difference in their vertical heights (\u0394*h*). The relationship is \u0394E\u2096 = -*mg*\u0394*h*. To find the smallest difference in kinetic energy, we must identify the smallest height difference.\n\nFor option C, the difference in kinetic energy is E\u209c - E\u2092. Applying the conservation of energy principle:\nE\u209c + *mgh*\u209c = E\u2092 + *mgh*\u2092\nE\u209c - E\u2092 = *mgh*\u2092 - *mgh*\u209c = *mg*(*h*\u2092 - *h*\u209c)\n\nThe heights are *h*\u2092 = 1.5 m and *h*\u209c = 1.3 m. The difference in height is:\n\u0394*h* = 1.5 m - 1.3 m = 0.2 m.\n\nThis height difference of 0.2 m is identical to that for option B, and both are larger than the height difference for option A, which is |1.6 m - 1.5 m| = 0.1 m. Therefore, the kinetic energy difference E\u209c - E\u2092 is not the smallest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBased on the conservation of mechanical energy, the difference in kinetic energy between any two points is proportional to the difference in their vertical heights. Specifically, a larger difference in height corresponds to a larger difference in kinetic energy.\n\nFor option D, the difference in kinetic energy is E\u209c - E\u1d63. Applying the conservation of energy principle:\nE\u209c + *mgh*\u209c = E\u1d63 + *mgh*\u1d63\nE\u209c - E\u1d63 = *mgh*\u1d63 - *mgh*\u209c = *mg*(*h*\u1d63 - *h*\u209c)\n\nThe heights are *h*\u1d63 = 1.8 m and *h*\u209c = 1.3 m. The difference in height is:\n\u0394*h* = 1.8 m - 1.3 m = 0.5 m.\n\nThis height difference of 0.5 m is the largest among all the options. Consequently, the difference in kinetic energy, E\u209c - E\u1d63, is the largest, not the smallest."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_59.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 the battery of a small tablet computer is initially uncharged. it is connected to a constant 10w\npower supply for 2.0 hours to charge the battery.\nthe efficiency of the charging process is 80%.\nwhat is the total energy stored in the battery?\na 16x10'j b 1.6x10\u00b0j c 58x 10*j d 58x 10\u00b0", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n1.  **Calculate the total energy input:**\n    The relationship between energy (E), power (P), and time (t) is given by the formula E = P \u00d7 t.

Energy must be calculated using time in seconds to obtain a result in Joules.\n\n*   **B: 1.6 \u00d7 10\u00b3 J**\n    This answer is incorrect. It arises from making two conceptual errors. Firstly, the time is not converted from hours to seconds. Secondly, the efficiency is used as the number 80 instead of its decimal equivalent, 0.80.

The value is 100 times larger than the correct answer. The correct calculation yields 5.8 \u00d7 10\u2074 J.

As the explosion is an internal process with no external horizontal forces, the total momentum of the system must remain zero after the explosion.\n\n    Let `m` and `2m` be the masses of the two fragments, and let their velocities be `v_m` and `v_2m`, respectively. Since they move in opposite directions, their velocities will have opposite signs.\n\n    Initial momentum = Final momentum\n    `0 = m * v_m + 2m * v_2m`\n\n    Rearranging this gives a relationship between the magnitudes of their velocities (their speeds, which we will denote as `s_m` and `s_2m`):\n    `m * s_m = 2m * s_2m`\n    `s_m = 2 * s_2m`\n\n    This shows that the lighter fragment (mass `m`) moves at twice the speed of the heavier fragment (mass `2m`).\n\n2.  **Total Kinetic Energy:** The problem states that the total kinetic energy `E` is transferred to the fragments. This is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments.\n\n    `E = KE_m + KE_2m`\n    `E = (1/2)m * s_m^2 + (1/2)(2m) * s_2m^2`\n\n3.  **Solving for `s_m`:** We have a system of two equations. We can solve for `s_m` by substituting the relationship from the conservation of momentum into the energy equation. From `s_m = 2 * s_2m`, we get `s_2m = s_m / 2`.\n\n    Substitute `s_2m = s_m / 2` into the energy equation:\n    `E = (1/2)m * s_m^2 + (1/2)(2m) * (s_m / 2)^2`\n    `E = (1/2)m * s_m^2 + m * (s_m^2 / 4)`\n    `E = (1/2)m * s_m^2 + (1/4)m * s_m^2`\n\n    To combine the terms, find a common denominator:\n    `E = (2/4)m * s_m^2 + (1/4)m * s_m^2`\n    `E = (3/4)m * s_m^2`\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to make `s_m` the subject:\n    `4E = 3m * s_m^2`\n    `s_m^2 = 4E / (3m)`\n    `s_m = sqrt(4E / 3m)`\n\n    Thus, the speed of the fragment of mass `m` is `sqrt(4E / 3m)`.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: `sqrt(E/m)`\nThis result would be obtained by using an incorrect formula for kinetic energy, `KE = mv^2` (instead of `KE = (1/2)mv^2`), and also incorrectly assuming that all the energy `E` is transferred only to the fragment of mass `m`. This approach disregards both the correct formula for kinetic energy and the principle of conservation of momentum, which requires the second fragment to move and possess kinetic energy as well.\n\n#### B: `sqrt(2E/m)`\nThis is the speed the fragment of mass `m` would have if it received all the kinetic energy `E` from the explosion (`E = (1/2)mv^2`). However, this is incorrect because the problem describes a system of two fragments. According to the conservation of momentum, if the fragment of mass `m` moves, the fragment of mass `2m` must also move in the opposite direction. Therefore, the second fragment must also have kinetic energy, meaning the kinetic energy of the first fragment must be less than the total energy `E`.\n\n#### C: `sqrt(2E/3m)`\nThis result arises from an incorrect distribution of the total kinetic energy `E` between the two fragments. From the relationship `KE = p^2 / (2m)` and knowing that both fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p`), the fragment with the smaller mass must have greater kinetic energy. The correct distribution is `KE_m = 2 * KE_2m`. This option would be reached if one incorrectly assumes the kinetic energy of the mass `m` is one-third of the total energy, `KE_m = E/3`. Setting `(1/2)m*s_m^2 = E/3` and solving for `s_m` gives `s_m = sqrt(2E/3m)`. The correct kinetic energy for the fragment of mass `m` is actually two-thirds of the total energy (`KE_m = 2E/3`)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_61.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "21 a spring is fixed at one end and extended by applying force f to the other end. the spring has\nextension x and elastic potential energy ep. the spring constant is k.\nthe spring obeys hooke\u2019s law.\nwhich relationship is correct for this spring?\na epof b epxx c epxk d epo x?", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe elastic potential energy (E_P) stored in a spring is equal to the work done to extend or compress it. For a spring that obeys Hooke's Law, the force (F) required to produce an extension (x) is directly proportional to the extension, given by the equation F = kx, where k is the spring constant.\n\nThe work done in stretching the spring is represented by the area under the force-extension graph. Since F = kx, this graph is a straight line passing through the origin. The area under this line from an extension of 0 to x is a triangle.\n\nWork Done (W) = Area of triangle = \u00bd \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\nW = \u00bd \u00d7 x \u00d7 F\n\nSince this work done is stored as elastic potential energy, we have:\nE_P = \u00bd Fx\n\nBy substituting Hooke's Law (F = kx) into this equation, we get:\nE_P = \u00bd (kx)x = \u00bd kx\u00b2\n\nFor a specific spring, the spring constant k is a constant value.

This relationship is written as E_P \u221d x\u00b2.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: E_P \u221d F**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While the formula for elastic potential energy can be written as E_P = \u00bd Fx, it is important to note that both F and x are variables that change together. According to Hooke's Law (F = kx), the extension x is directly proportional to the applied force F (since x = F/k). Substituting this into the energy equation gives:\nE_P = \u00bd F (F/k) = F\u00b2 / (2k)\nSince k is constant for the spring, this shows that the elastic potential energy is proportional to the square of the applied force (E_P \u221d F\u00b2), not directly proportional to the force itself.\n\n**B: E_P \u221d x**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The relationship between elastic potential energy and extension is not linear. As derived from the area under the force-extension graph and Hooke's law, the correct formula is E_P = \u00bd kx\u00b2. This equation shows that E_P is proportional to the square of the extension (x\u00b2).

The spring constant, k, is an intrinsic property of a given spring and does not change as the spring is stretched. A proportionality relationship describes how one variable changes in response to another. In the process of extending a single spring, the variables are force (F), extension (x), and stored energy (E_P), while k remains constant.

Hooke's Law states that the force applied to an elastic object is directly proportional to its extension (F \u221d x), provided the elastic limit is not exceeded. On a force-extension graph, this direct proportionality is represented by a straight line passing through the origin. The limit of proportionality is the precise point on the graph where this linear relationship ends and the graph begins to curve. Beyond this point, the force is no longer directly proportional to the extension, and therefore, Hooke's law is no longer obeyed.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. the point at which the wire breaks**\n\nThis describes the **fracture point** or **breaking point** of the wire. This is the point of maximum stress and strain where the material fails completely. The fracture point occurs much later on the force-extension graph, well after the wire has surpassed both its limit of proportionality and its elastic limit, and has undergone significant plastic (permanent) deformation.\n\n**C. the point beyond which the wire cannot return to its original length**\n\nThis statement describes the **elastic limit**. The elastic limit is the maximum force or stress that can be applied to a material without causing permanent deformation. If the applied force is removed before reaching the elastic limit, the wire will return to its original length. If the force exceeds the elastic limit, the wire will be permanently stretched. While the elastic limit and the limit of proportionality are often close for many materials, they are distinct concepts. It is possible for a material to be stretched beyond its limit of proportionality (so F is not proportional to x) but still be within its elastic limit (so it would return to its original length).\n\n**D. the point beyond which the wire starts to deform plastically**\n\nThis is an alternative way of defining the **elastic limit**. Plastic deformation is a permanent change in the shape or size of a material that occurs when the applied force exceeds the elastic limit. Therefore, the point beyond which plastic deformation begins is, by definition, the elastic limit, not the limit of proportionality. The limit of proportionality concerns the linearity of the force-extension relationship, whereas the elastic limit concerns the reversibility of the deformation."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_63.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "23 aspring has a spring constant of 6.0ncm\u2122\". it is joined to another spring whose spring constant\n\nis 4.0ncm\". a load of 80n is suspended from this composite spring.\n\n6.0ncm*\n\n4.0ncm*\n\nload\n\n80n\nwhat is the extension of this composite spring?\na 80cm b 16cm c 17cm d 33cm", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nWhen two springs are connected in series, the same tension acts on both springs.

For springs in parallel, the effective spring constant is the sum of the individual constants (*k_eff* = *k\u2081* + *k\u2082* = 6.0 + 4.0 = 10.0 N cm\u207b\u00b9).

However, the diagram shows a series arrangement.\n\n#### B: 16 cm\n\nThis answer is incorrect. It may arise from incorrectly averaging the spring constants (*k_avg* = (6.0 + 4.0) / 2 = 5.0 N cm\u207b\u00b9) and then calculating the extension (*x* = 80 N / 5.0 N cm\u207b\u00b9 = 16 cm). This method of averaging spring constants does not correspond to any standard physical arrangement of springs.\n\n#### C: 17 cm\n\nThis answer is incorrect and likely stems from the misconception that the load is shared or divided between the two springs.

Since wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency (as seen in \u03bb = v/f), the minimum frequency will correspond to the maximum wavelength, and the maximum frequency will correspond to the minimum wavelength.\n\n**Calculate the maximum wavelength (\u03bb_max) using the minimum frequency (f_min = 10 Hz):**\n\u03bb_max = v / f_min = 1500 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 10 Hz = 150 m\n\n**Calculate the minimum wavelength (\u03bb_min) using the maximum frequency (f_max = 40 Hz):**\n\u03bb_min = v / f_max = 1500 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 40 Hz = 37.5 m\n\nTherefore, the approximate range of wavelengths is from 37.5 m to 150 m. Rounding 37.5 m to two significant figures gives 38 m. This matches option D.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 6.7 mm to 27 mm**\nThis option is incorrect due to a calculation error where the formula for wavelength was inverted (i.e., \u03bb = f/v was used instead of \u03bb = v/f). Using the correct speed v = 1500 m s\u207b\u00b9, this incorrect calculation would yield 10/1500 \u2248 0.0067 m (or 6.7 mm) and 40/1500 \u2248 0.027 m (or 27 mm). This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the fundamental wave speed equation.\n\n**B: 3.8 cm to 15 cm**\nThis result is obtained if the speed of sound is not converted from km s\u207b\u00b9 to m s\u207b\u00b9. If the value v = 1.5 is used directly in the equation \u03bb = v/f, the calculations would be \u03bb_min = 1.5 / 40 = 0.0375 m (or 3.8 cm) and \u03bb_max = 1.5 / 10 = 0.15 m (or 15 cm). This highlights a failure to maintain consistent SI units throughout the calculation.\n\n**C: 6.7 m to 27 m**\nThis answer arises from a combination of errors. It results from inverting the wave speed formula (using \u03bb = f/v) and also making a unit error by using the speed in km s\u207b\u00b9 (v=1.5) but interpreting the final answer in metres.

To find this setting, one must first determine the period of the wave and the length it occupies on the screen.\n\n1.  **Calculate the period (T) of the wave:** The period is the reciprocal of the frequency (f).\n    *   Given frequency, f = 2.5 kHz = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u00b3 Hz.\n    *   Period, T = 1 / f = 1 / (2.5 \u00d7 10\u00b3 Hz) = 0.0004 s.\n    *   Converting seconds to milliseconds: T = 0.0004 s \u00d7 1000 ms/s = 0.4 ms.\n\n2.  **Determine the horizontal length of one cycle from the CRO display:** By observing the grid, one complete cycle of the wave (e.g., from one peak to the next, or from the start to where the pattern repeats) spans 4 horizontal divisions. Since each division is 1 cm, the length of one cycle is 4 cm.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time-base setting:** The time-base setting is the period divided by the horizontal length of one cycle.\n    *   Time-base = Period / Length\n    *   Time-base = 0.4 ms / 4 cm = 0.1 ms cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nTherefore, the setting on the time-base of the CRO is 0.1 ms cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect options:\n\n**B: 0.4 ms cm\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value is incorrect. It is equal to the period of the wave (0.4 ms), not the time-base setting. This answer would arise from the misconception that the period itself is the time-base setting, which would imply that one complete cycle occupies only 1 cm on the screen. However, the display clearly shows one cycle spanning 4 cm.\n\n**C: 0.1 s cm\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value is incorrect due to a unit error. While the numerical value of 0.1 is correct, the unit is seconds per centimetre (s cm\u207b\u00b9) instead of milliseconds per centimetre (ms cm\u207b\u00b9). If the time-base were 0.1 s cm\u207b\u00b9, the period of the displayed 4 cm wave would be T = 4 cm \u00d7 0.1 s cm\u207b\u00b9 = 0.4 s.

It involves errors in both the numerical value and the time unit. This answer might be obtained by confusing the calculated period (0.4 ms) with the time-base setting and simultaneously making a unit error (s instead of ms). If the time-base were 0.4 s cm\u207b\u00b9, the period of the 4 cm wave would be T = 4 cm \u00d7 0.4 s cm\u207b\u00b9 = 1.6 s, leading to a frequency of f = 1/1.6 s = 0.625 Hz, which is inconsistent with the given information."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_66.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 a source of sound waves with constant frequency moves towards a stationary observer.\nthe observer compares the sound waves arriving at the observer\u2019s position with the waves\nemitted by the source of sound.\nwhat is detected by the observer?\na adecreased frequency of the sound waves\nb- nochange in frequency of the sound waves\nc adecreased wavelength of the sound waves\nd_ nochange in wavelength of the sound waves", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThis scenario describes the Doppler effect for sound waves. When a sound source moves towards a stationary observer, the source emits successive wavefronts from progressively closer positions relative to the observer. This motion causes the wavefronts to become compressed or \"bunched up\" in the direction of the observer. The distance between consecutive wavefronts is the wavelength. Therefore, the observer detects a sound wave with a shorter, or decreased, wavelength compared to the wavelength emitted by the source if it were stationary.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. a decreased frequency of the sound waves**\nThis is incorrect. The relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the wave equation: v = f\u03bb. The speed of sound in a given medium (like air) is constant. As explained for the correct answer, when the source moves towards the observer, the wavelength (\u03bb) decreases. For the wave speed (v) to remain constant, a decrease in wavelength must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the observed frequency (f). A decreased frequency would be observed if the source were moving away from the observer.\n\n**B. no change in frequency of the sound waves**\nThis is incorrect. The Doppler effect describes the change in observed frequency and wavelength of a wave due to relative motion between the source and the observer. Because the sound source is moving relative to the stationary observer, the observer will detect a change in the frequency of the sound waves. No change in frequency would only be detected if there were no relative motion between the source and the observer.\n\n**D. no change in wavelength of the sound waves**\nThis is incorrect. The movement of the source through the medium directly affects the spatial distribution of the wavefronts. As the source moves, it chases the waves it emits in the forward direction, causing the distance between wavefronts (the wavelength) to decrease. A stationary source would produce waves with a constant wavelength in all directions, but a moving source does not. Therefore, a change in wavelength is detected."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_67.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 which type of waves cannot be polarised?\na_ radio waves\nb_ sound waves\nc ultraviolet waves\nd x-rays", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nSound waves are longitudinal waves. In a longitudinal wave, the vibrations or oscillations of the particles of the medium are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. Polarisation is a phenomenon that applies exclusively to transverse waves; it is the process of restricting the oscillations of a transverse wave to a single plane. Since the oscillations of a longitudinal wave occur only in one dimension (along the direction of travel), there are no other planes of vibration to select or filter out. Therefore, sound waves cannot be polarised.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. radio waves**\nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave. All electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, are transverse waves. For a transverse wave, the oscillations (of the electric and magnetic fields) are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. Unpolarised transverse waves oscillate in multiple planes perpendicular to their direction of propagation. A polarising filter can be used to select one of these planes and block the others. Thus, radio waves can be polarised.\n\n**C. ultraviolet waves**\nUltraviolet (UV) waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum and are, by nature, transverse waves. In a transverse wave, the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction the wave travels. This property allows the wave's oscillations, which normally occur in many different planes, to be confined to a single plane through the process of polarisation. Therefore, ultraviolet waves can be polarised.\n\n**D. X-rays**\nX-rays are high-frequency electromagnetic waves. Like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, they are transverse waves. This means their electric and magnetic fields oscillate in planes that are perpendicular to their direction of propagation. Because they are transverse, X-rays can be polarised by restricting their oscillations to a single plane, for instance, by scattering them off a crystal lattice."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_68.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 a beam of light with power p has an area of cross-section a.\nthe amplitude of the light waves in the beam is x.\nthe beam of light is then changed to one with the same frequency but with an increased\namplitude of 4x and an area of cross-section reduced to >\nwhat is the power of the new beam?\na 1.3p b 5.3p c 12p d 48p", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe power (P) of a beam of light is the product of its intensity (I) and its cross-sectional area (A).

Firstly, assuming that power is directly proportional to amplitude (P \u221d X) instead of amplitude squared. Secondly, assuming that power is inversely proportional to area (P \u221d 1/A). This would lead to the incorrect proportionality P' \u221d X' / A', giving P' \u221d (4X) / (A/3) = 12(X/A), resulting in P' = 12P. Power is directly proportional to area (P = I \u00d7 A), not inversely.\n\n**D. 48P**\nThis answer results from correctly relating power to the square of the amplitude but incorrectly assuming that power is inversely proportional to area (P \u221d 1/A). This error leads to the calculation P' \u221d X'\u00b2 / A' = (4X)\u00b2 / (A/3) = 16X\u00b2 / (A/3) = 48(X\u00b2/A), resulting in P' = 48P.

This would give \u03bb = 2.0 m / 5 = 0.40 m. This is incorrect because the distance between consecutive antinodes is \u03bb/2, and there are only 4 such intervals between the first and fifth maxima.\n\n**B. 0.50 m**\nThis value arises from the misconception that the distance between consecutive antinodes is one full wavelength (\u03bb). If this were true, the total distance for 4 intervals would be 4\u03bb. Setting 4\u03bb = 2.0 m gives \u03bb = 0.50 m. However, the fundamental principle of stationary waves is that the separation between consecutive antinodes (or nodes) is half a wavelength (\u03bb/2).\n\n**C. 0.80 m**\nThis answer results from a common counting error. It assumes there are 5 intervals between the first and fifth maximum instead of 4. Using 5 intervals, the calculation would be: Total distance = 5 \u00d7 (\u03bb/2) = 2.0 m.

For two wave sources to be coherent, they must emit waves that have a constant phase difference between them. This means that if the crest of one wave is emitted a certain fraction of a cycle before or after the crest of the other wave, this time relationship remains fixed. This constant phase relationship is a necessary condition for the waves to produce a stable and observable interference pattern when they superpose. In addition to a constant phase difference, coherent waves must also have the same frequency.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) The waves are emitted in phase.**\nThis statement describes a specific case of coherence, but it is not the general condition that **must** be true. \"In phase\" means the phase difference is zero (or an integer multiple of 2\u03c0 radians). While sources that are in phase are coherent, sources can also be coherent if they have a non-zero, constant phase difference (e.g., a constant phase difference of \u03c0 radians, meaning they are perfectly out of phase). The essential requirement for coherence is that this phase difference, whatever its value, does not change over time.\n\n**B) The waves are emitted and move in opposite directions.**\nThe direction of propagation of waves is independent of the property of coherence. Coherent waves can travel in the same direction, opposite directions, or at an angle to each other. For instance, in a double-slit experiment, two coherent sources produce waves that travel in roughly the same forward direction to create an interference pattern on a screen. Conversely, a standing wave is formed by the superposition of two coherent waves travelling in opposite directions. Therefore, the direction of motion is not a defining characteristic of coherence.\n\n**D) The waves are emitted with the same amplitude.**\nWhile having the same amplitude is important for achieving maximum contrast in an interference pattern (i.e., for destructive interference to result in zero displacement), it is not a requirement for coherence itself. Two waves with different amplitudes can still be coherent, provided their phase difference is constant. They will still interfere, but the destructive interference will be incomplete, meaning the resultant amplitude at the minima will not be zero.

This leads to the following sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Total External Resistance:** The variable resistor and the fixed resistor are connected in parallel. The equivalent resistance of a parallel combination, R_ext, is given by 1/R_ext = 1/R_fixed + 1/R_var. When the resistance of the variable resistor (R_var) is decreased, the term 1/R_var increases. This causes 1/R_ext to increase, which means the total external resistance, R_ext, decreases.\n\n2.  **Total Circuit Current:** The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the external resistance and the internal resistance of the cell, R_total = R_ext + r. As R_ext has decreased and the internal resistance r is constant, the total circuit resistance R_total decreases. The total current flowing from the cell is given by I_total = E / R_total, where E is the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell. Since R_total has decreased, the total current I_total increases.\n\n3.  **Potential Difference (V):** The potential difference V across the variable resistor is the same as the terminal potential difference of the cell. The terminal p.d. is calculated as V = E - I_total * r. Since the total current I_total has increased, the potential drop across the internal resistance, known as 'lost volts' (I_total * r), also increases. As the e.m.f. (E) is constant, an increase in the lost volts results in a decrease in the terminal potential difference V. Therefore, V decreases.\n\n4.  **Current (I):** The total current I_total splits between the two parallel branches. Let the current in the fixed resistor be I_fixed and the current in the variable resistor be I. So, I_total = I_fixed + I. The current in the fixed resistor is given by I_fixed = V / R_fixed. Since V has decreased and R_fixed is constant, the current I_fixed must decrease. We have established that I_total increases and I_fixed decreases. From the relationship I = I_total - I_fixed, it is clear that if I_total is increasing and I_fixed is decreasing, the current I must increase.\n\nIn summary, the potential difference V decreases, and the current I increases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A: V decreases, I decreases**\n    This option is incorrect because the current I increases. While the potential difference V across the variable resistor decreases, the resistance R_var is also decreased. The current is the ratio of these two quantities (I = V/R_var). The fractional decrease in resistance is greater than the fractional decrease in voltage, resulting in an overall increase in current. This can be confirmed by analysing the currents in the circuit: the total current increases while the current in the other parallel branch decreases, necessitating an increase in current I.\n\n*   **C: V increases, I decreases**\n    This option is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, the potential difference V decreases, it does not increase. An increase in the total current drawn from the cell leads to a larger potential drop across the internal resistance (lost volts), which reduces the terminal potential difference V (V = E - I_total * r). Secondly, as explained above, the current I increases, it does not decrease.\n\n*   **D: V increases, I increases**\n    This option is incorrect because the potential difference V decreases. As the total external resistance of the circuit decreases, more current is drawn from the cell. This larger current causes a greater potential drop across the cell's internal resistance, which in turn reduces the terminal potential difference V available to the external circuit. Although the current I does increase, the premise that V increases is false."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_76.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "36 a radioactive source produces a beam of a-particles in a vacuum. the average current caused\nby the a-particles in the beam is 1.5 x 10\u00b0\u00b0a.\nthe beam is incident on a metal target.\nwhat is the average number of a-particles hitting the metal target in a time of 3.0s?\na 47x10\u00b0 b 9.4.x 10\u00b0 cc 14x10\" d 2.8x 10\"", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe average number of \u03b1-particles is correctly calculated as 1.4 x 10\u00b9\u2070.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Relate Current, Charge, and Time:** Electric current (I) is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge (Q) per unit time (t).

The sign and magnitude of the charge do not depend on the potential difference across the wire.**\n\nThis statement is correct because the charge of an electron is a fundamental and intrinsic property of the particle. The elementary charge, denoted by *e*, has a constant magnitude of approximately 1.602 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 Coulombs. The sign of an electron's charge is, by convention, negative. These properties are invariant and do not change under the influence of an external electric field, which is what a potential difference across a wire creates. The potential difference affects the motion of the free electrons, causing them to drift and constitute an electric current, but it does not alter the fundamental charge of each individual electron.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The magnitude of the charge increases with the potential difference across the wire.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The magnitude of an electron's charge is the elementary charge, *e*, which is a fundamental physical constant. Applying a potential difference across a wire increases the electric field strength, which in turn increases the force on the electrons and their average drift velocity. This leads to a larger current (rate of flow of charge), but the amount of charge on each individual electron remains constant.\n\n**B. The magnitude of the charge is zero unless there is a potential difference across the wire.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An electron possesses its fundamental charge regardless of whether it is in an electric field. In a metal wire with no potential difference, free electrons are in constant, random thermal motion. Each of these electrons still carries its negative charge of magnitude *e*. A potential difference is required to create a net directional flow (current), but not for the electrons to possess charge.\n\n**D. The sign of the charge depends on the potential difference across the wire.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The charge of an electron is defined as negative. This is a fundamental, unchanging characteristic of the particle. A potential difference creates an electric field that determines the direction of the force experienced by the electron (F = qE), causing it to move towards the higher potential.

When an unstable nucleus emits an \u03b1-particle, its atomic number (Z) decreases by 2, and its mass number (A) decreases by 4. The change in atomic number is \u0394Z = -2.\n*   **\u03b2\u207b-decay**: A \u03b2\u207b-particle is an electron (\u207b\u00b9\u2070e). It is emitted when a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron. This process increases the atomic number by 1 (\u0394Z = +1) while the mass number remains unchanged.\n\nThe problem states that the decay process continues until an *isotope* of the original element is produced. Isotopes are atoms of the same element, meaning they have the same atomic number (Z) but different mass numbers (A). Therefore, the overall change in the atomic number (\u0394Z) after the entire decay sequence must be zero.\n\nLet `n_\u03b1` be the number of \u03b1-particles emitted and `n_\u03b2` be the number of \u03b2\u207b-particles emitted. The total change in the atomic number can be expressed as:\n\u0394Z = (`n_\u03b1` \u00d7 -2) + (`n_\u03b2` \u00d7 +1)\n\nFor the final nucleus to be an isotope of the original, \u0394Z must equal 0:\n-2`n_\u03b1` + `n_\u03b2` = 0\n`n_\u03b2` = 2`n_\u03b1`\n\nThis equation shows that to return to the original atomic number, the number of \u03b2\u207b-decays must be exactly twice the number of \u03b1-decays.\n\nThe total number of particles emitted, `N`, is the sum of the \u03b1 and \u03b2\u207b particles:\n`N` = `n_\u03b1` + `n_\u03b2`\n\nSubstituting `n_\u03b2` = 2`n_\u03b1` into the equation for `N`:\n`N` = `n_\u03b1` + 2`n_\u03b1`\n`N` = 3`n_\u03b1`\n\nThe problem requires the *minimum possible number* of emitted particles. Since the nucleus must decay at least once to form a different element, `n_\u03b1` cannot be zero (if `n_\u03b1`=0, then `n_\u03b2`=0, and no decay occurs). Therefore, the minimum possible integer value for `n_\u03b1` is 1.\n\nIf `n_\u03b1` = 1, then:\n*   `n_\u03b2` = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n*   `N` = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n\nThus, the minimum number of particles that must be emitted is 3 (one \u03b1-particle and two \u03b2\u207b-particles).\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A: 2** is incorrect. If only two particles were emitted, the possible combinations are:\n*   Two \u03b1-particles: \u0394Z = 2 \u00d7 (-2) = -4\n*   Two \u03b2\u207b-particles: \u0394Z = 2 \u00d7 (+1) = +2\n*   One \u03b1-particle and one \u03b2\u207b-particle: \u0394Z = (-2) + (+1) = -1\nIn none of these cases is the net change in atomic number zero. Therefore, it is impossible to form an isotope of the original element by emitting only two particles.\n\n**C: 4** is incorrect. According to the derived relationship `N = 3n_\u03b1`, if the total number of particles `N` were 4, then `4 = 3n_\u03b1`, which gives `n_\u03b1 = 4/3`.

This means it contains 6 protons and (10 - 6) = 4 neutrons.\n*   **Boron-10 (\u00b9\u2070\u2085B):** Has an atomic number (Z) of 5 and a mass number (A) of 10. This means it contains 5 protons and (10 - 5) = 5 neutrons.\n\nComparing the initial and final states, the number of protons has decreased by one (6 \u2192 5), while the number of neutrons has increased by one (4 \u2192 5). This indicates that within the nucleus, a **proton has transformed into a neutron**. This type of decay is known as positron emission or beta-plus (\u03b2\u207a) decay.\n\nNext, we examine the change in quark composition.\n*   A **proton** is composed of two up quarks and one down quark (uud). Its charge is (+2/3)e + (+2/3)e + (-1/3)e = +1e.\n*   A **neutron** is composed of one up quark and two down quarks (udd). Its charge is (+2/3)e + (-1/3)e + (-1/3)e = 0.\n\nFor a proton to change into a neutron (uud \u2192 udd), one of its **up quarks** must change into a **down quark**. This change in quark flavour is mediated by the weak nuclear force.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the process is a change from a proton to a neutron, which involves an up quark becoming a down quark.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: proton to neutron, down becomes up**\n    This option correctly identifies the nucleon change as a proton transforming into a neutron. However, it incorrectly states the quark change. The transformation of a down quark into an up quark (d \u2192 u) would result in a neutron (udd) changing into a proton (uud), which is the opposite of what occurs in this decay.\n\n*   **C: neutron to proton, down becomes up**\n    This option incorrectly identifies the nucleon change. The atomic number decreases from 6 to 5, meaning a proton is lost, not gained. A neutron changing into a proton occurs in beta-minus (\u03b2\u207b) decay, where the atomic number increases by one. While the quark change described (down becomes up) is consistent with a neutron-to-proton conversion, this is not the process occurring in the decay of carbon-10 to boron-10.\n\n*   **D: neutron to proton, up becomes down**\n    This option is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, the nucleon change is from a proton to a neutron, not the other way around. Secondly, the two parts of the option are contradictory. A neutron-to-proton change involves a down quark becoming an up quark, whereas this option states an up quark becomes a down quark (which corresponds to a proton-to-neutron change)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_81.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "1. which unit is not an si base unit?\na a b kg c cc dis", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "The International System of Units (SI) is founded on seven fundamental, or base, units that correspond to fundamental physical quantities.

The total number of atoms (N) can be found by dividing the total volume of the material (V_total) by the approximate volume occupied by a single atom (V_atom).\n\n**N = V_total / V_atom**\n\n1.  **Determine the total volume in SI units:**\n    The given volume is V_total = 50 cm\u00b3. To work with standard physical constants, we convert this to cubic metres (m\u00b3).\n    Since 1 cm = 10\u207b\u00b2 m, then 1 cm\u00b3 = (10\u207b\u00b2 m)\u00b3 = 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b3.\n    Therefore, V_total = 50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3.\n\n2.  **Estimate the volume of a single atom:**\n    Atoms in a solid are packed closely together. A reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate for the effective diameter of an atom (i.e., the space it occupies) is about 1 \u00c5 to 3 \u00c5, which is 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m to 3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m. For a simple estimation, we can model the volume occupied by one atom as a cube with a side length approximately equal to this diameter. A common value used for such estimations is d \u2248 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m.\n    The volume of this cube is:\n    V_atom \u2248 d\u00b3 = (10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m)\u00b3 = 10\u207b\u00b3\u2070 m\u00b3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of atoms:**\n    Now, we can estimate the total number of atoms:\n    N = V_total / V_atom = (5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3) / (10\u207b\u00b3\u2070 m\u00b3) = 5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2075 atoms.\n\nThis calculation yields a result that matches option B exactly.\n\n**Alternative Check using Density:**\nWe can also estimate the number of atoms using density (\u03c1), molar mass (M), and Avogadro's constant (N_A \u2248 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 mol\u207b\u00b9). Let's use a typical metal like iron (Fe) or aluminium (Al).\n\n*   For aluminium (Al): \u03c1 \u2248 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, M \u2248 27 g/mol.\n    *   Mass (m) = \u03c1 \u00d7 V = 2.7 g/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 50 cm\u00b3 = 135 g.\n    *   Number of moles (n) = m / M = 135 g / 27 g/mol = 5 mol.\n    *   Number of atoms (N) = n \u00d7 N_A = 5 \u00d7 (6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3) \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074 atoms.\n\nWhile this result is approximately 3 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074, it is on the same order of magnitude as 5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2075. The options provided are separated by several orders of magnitude, making 5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2075 the most plausible choice. The slight discrepancy arises from the simplifying assumptions made in estimation.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2075**\nThis value is far too small for a macroscopic piece of metal. If 5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2075 atoms occupied a volume of 50 cm\u00b3, the number density of atoms would be (5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2075 atoms) / (5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3) = 10\u00b2\u2070 atoms/m\u00b3. The typical number density of atoms in a solid is around 10\u00b2\u2078 atoms/m\u00b3. This option is incorrect by about 8 orders of magnitude, implying an almost empty space rather than a solid metal.\n\n**C: 5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2079**\nThis value is too large. If there were 5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2079 atoms in the 50 cm\u00b3 volume, we can calculate the volume occupied by a single atom:\nV_atom = V_total / N = (5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3) / (5 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2079 atoms) = 10\u207b\u00b3\u2074 m\u00b3/atom.\nThe side length (d) of a cube with this volume would be d = (10\u207b\u00b3\u2074 m\u00b3)^(1/3) \u2248 4.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m. This is about 100 times smaller than the actual size of an atom (~10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m) and is closer to the size of an atomic nucleus. This implies an impossible packing density for atoms.\n\n**D: 5 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u00b9**\nThis value is even more drastically incorrect than option C. If there were 5 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u00b9 atoms, the volume per atom would be:\nV_atom = V_total / N = (5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3) / (5 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u00b9 atoms) = 10\u207b\u00b3\u2076 m\u00b3/atom.\nThe side length (d) of a cube with this volume would be d = (10\u207b\u00b3\u2076 m\u00b3)^(1/3) = 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m. This size is characteristic of a large atomic nucleus, not a whole atom. Packing atoms this tightly would require compressing them to nuclear densities, which is physically impossible under normal conditions and would result in a mass many orders of magnitude greater than that of any normal metal."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_83.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "3  accopper pipe has a true diameter of 42.03 mm.\n\na builder measures the diameter of the pipe five times using digital calipers. the measurements\n\nare shown.\n48.01\n47.99\n48.01\n48.00\n47.99\n\nwhat describes the builder's measurements?\n\na accurate and precise\n\nb_ accurate but not precise\n\nc not precise and not accurate\n\nd precise but not accurate", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\n**Precision** refers to how close a set of repeated measurements are to each other.

This situation often arises from a systematic error, such as a miscalibrated measuring instrument.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: accurate and precise**\nThis description is incorrect. While the measurements are precise due to their small spread and consistency, they are not accurate. The average measured value of 48.00 mm is significantly different from the true value of 42.03 mm. For measurements to be accurate, they must be close to the true value.\n\n**B: accurate but not precise**\nThis description is incorrect. The measurements are not accurate, as their average (48.00 mm) is far from the true value (42.03 mm). Furthermore, the measurements are highly precise because the repeated values are very close to each other. This option incorrectly describes both the accuracy and precision of the data.\n\n**C: not precise and not accurate**\nThis description is partially correct but ultimately wrong. The measurements are indeed not accurate. However, they are highly precise. The values are tightly clustered, with a range of only 0.02 mm, which indicates a high degree of precision.

The formula for the magnitude of the resultant force, R, of two forces F\u2081 and F\u2082 with an angle \u03b8 between their directions is:\n\nR\u00b2 = F\u2081\u00b2 + F\u2082\u00b2 + 2F\u2081F\u2082cos(\u03b8)\n\nIn this problem, the magnitudes of the two forces are F\u2081 = 10 N and F\u2082 = 10 N, and the angle \u03b8 between them is 120\u00b0.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\nR\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 + 2(10)(10)cos(120\u00b0)\nSince cos(120\u00b0) = -0.5:\nR\u00b2 = 100 + 100 + 200(-0.5)\nR\u00b2 = 200 - 100\nR\u00b2 = 100\nR = \u221a100 = 10 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the resultant force is 10 N.\n\nAn alternative geometric approach is to use the head-to-tail method of vector addition. When the two force vectors are arranged head-to-tail, they form two sides of a triangle. The angle within the triangle, between these two vectors, is 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0. Since the two sides have an equal length of 10 N, this is an isosceles triangle. The angles opposite the equal sides must also be equal. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0, the other two angles are each (180\u00b0 - 60\u00b0)/2 = 60\u00b0. A triangle with all three angles equal to 60\u00b0 is an equilateral triangle, meaning all three sides are equal. Thus, the third side, which represents the resultant force, also has a magnitude of 10 N.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: 5 N\n\nThis value may arise from a misunderstanding of vector components. If one resolves the forces into perpendicular components, with one 10 N force along the x-axis, the x-component of the resultant force would be R\u2093 = 10 N + (10 N \u00d7 cos(120\u00b0)) = 10 N - 5 N = 5 N. However, this is only the component of the resultant force in the x-direction. The total magnitude of the resultant force must also account for the y-component (R\u1d67) and is found using the Pythagorean theorem (R = \u221a(R\u2093\u00b2 + R\u1d67\u00b2)). The magnitude of a vector is not generally equal to the magnitude of one of its components.\n\n#### C: 17 N\n\nThis result (approximately 17.3 N) is obtained if the incorrect angle is used in the Law of Cosines. If one mistakenly uses the angle 60\u00b0 (which is the supplementary angle to 120\u00b0) in the formula, the calculation would be R\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 + 2(10)(10)cos(60\u00b0) = 100 + 100 + 200(0.5) = 300. This gives R = \u221a300 \u2248 17.3 N. The angle \u03b8 in the standard formula must be the angle between the two vectors when placed tail-to-tail, which is 120\u00b0 as given in the problem.\n\n#### D: 20 N\n\nThis value is the result of the arithmetic sum of the magnitudes of the two forces (10 N + 10 N = 20 N). Force is a vector quantity, defined by both magnitude and direction. Vectors cannot be added by simply summing their magnitudes unless they are acting in the same direction (i.e., the angle between them is 0\u00b0). Since the forces act at an angle of 120\u00b0 to each other, vector addition must be used. The resultant of two forces acting at an angle will always be less than the arithmetic sum of their magnitudes."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_85.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "5 one object moves directly from p to r.\nr\ne\nq\ne\np\ne\nin a shorter time, a second object moves from p to q to r.\nwhich statement about the two objects is correct for the journey from p to r?\na_ they have the same average speed.\nb_ they have the same average velocity.\nc_ they have the same displacement.\nd_ they travel the same distance.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: C\n\n**Displacement** is a vector quantity defined as the shortest straight-line distance from an object's initial position to its final position, including the direction.

The calculation `H = u_x\u00b2 / (2g) = (7.71)\u00b2 / (2 \u00d7 9.81) \u2248 3.0 m` is incorrect because the vertical motion is governed by the vertical component of velocity, not the horizontal one. The horizontal velocity component determines the range of the projectile, not its maximum height.\n\n**D. 7.3 m**\nThis value is calculated by incorrectly using the total initial velocity (12 m/s) in the formula for vertical motion, without resolving it into its vertical component: `H = u\u00b2 / (2g) = 12\u00b2 / (2 \u00d7 9.81) \u2248 7.3 m`.

This means the net force acting on it is zero. The upward thrust force generated by the propellers must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the downward gravitational force (weight) of the drone.\n\n1.  **Calculate the weight of the drone:**\n    The weight (W) is the product of the drone's mass (m_drone) and the acceleration due to gravity (g \u2248 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2).\n    W = m_drone \u00d7 g = 1.20 kg \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 = 11.772 N\n\n2.  **Determine the total upward thrust:**\n    Since the drone is in equilibrium, the total upward thrust (F_total) must equal its weight.\n    F_total = 11.772 N\n\n3.  **Calculate the thrust per propeller:**\n    The total thrust is generated by four identical propellers. Assuming the thrust is distributed equally, the thrust from a single propeller (F_prop) is:\n    F_prop = F_total / 4 = 11.772 N / 4 = 2.943 N\n\n4.  **Apply Newton's Laws:**\n    According to Newton's Third Law, the upward thrust force exerted by the air on the propeller is equal in magnitude to the downward force the propeller exerts on the air. This force is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the air pushed by the propeller.\n    F_prop = \u0394p / \u0394t\n\n5.  **Calculate the speed of the air:**\n    The change in momentum (\u0394p) of the air is given by m_air \u00d7 (v - u), where m_air is the mass of the air pushed, v is its final speed, and u is its initial speed. Since the air above the propeller is stationary, u = 0.\n    \u0394p = m_air \u00d7 v\n    Therefore, F_prop = (m_air \u00d7 v) / \u0394t.\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the speed, v:\n    v = (F_prop \u00d7 \u0394t) / m_air\n    v = (2.943 N \u00d7 1.00 s) / 0.400 kg = 7.3575 m s\u207b\u00b9\n    Rounding to three significant figures, the speed of the air is 7.36 m s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 0.750 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis answer is incorrect because it results from confusing the drone's mass with its weight. It erroneously uses the numerical value of the mass (1.20) as the force in Newtons, thus omitting the crucial step of multiplying by the acceleration due to gravity (g). The weight of the drone is approximately 11.8 N, not 1.20 N.\n\n**B: 3.00 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value is obtained by incorrectly dividing the mass of the drone (1.20 kg) by the mass of the air pushed by a single propeller (0.400 kg). This is a misuse of the given quantities and the resulting calculation (1.20 / 0.400 = 3.00) is dimensionally incorrect for speed and does not follow from the principles of momentum and force.\n\n**D: 29.4 m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis answer is incorrect because it assumes that the entire weight of the drone is supported by the thrust from only one propeller. The calculation correctly determines the total thrust required to lift the drone (11.772 N) but fails to divide this force among the four propellers.

According to the principles of fluid dynamics, this force has two key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Zero drag at zero velocity:** When the ball is at rest (*v* = 0), there is no relative motion between the ball and the fluid, so the drag force is zero (*F* = 0). Therefore, any valid graph representing this relationship must pass through the origin (0,0).\n2.  **Increasing drag with increasing velocity:** As the velocity of the ball increases, the drag force opposing its motion also increases. The relationship is not always linear. At low velocities (laminar flow), the drag force is approximately proportional to the velocity (*F* \u221d *v*). At higher velocities (turbulent flow), the drag force becomes approximately proportional to the square of the velocity (*F* \u221d *v*\u00b2).\n\nGraph A correctly depicts these characteristics. It starts at the origin, showing *F* = 0 at *v* = 0. As *v* increases, *F* also increases. The upward curve, where the gradient (slope) increases with velocity, is consistent with the relationship *F* \u221d *v*\u00b2, which is a common model for drag force in many scenarios, including an object falling through a fluid like oil once it gains sufficient speed.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis graph correctly starts at the origin (*F* = 0 at *v* = 0) and shows the drag force *F* increasing as velocity *v* increases. However, the gradient of the curve decreases as *v* increases. This implies that for the same increase in velocity, the resulting increase in drag force becomes smaller at higher speeds. This is physically incorrect. In reality, the drag force continues to increase robustly with velocity, and the relationship is typically described by *F* \u221d *v* or *F* \u221d *v*\u00b2, both of which would have a constant or increasing gradient, respectively. A decreasing gradient is not a standard model for viscous drag.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis graph shows the drag force *F* initially increasing with velocity *v*, reaching a maximum value, and then decreasing as the velocity continues to increase. This is physically incorrect. The viscous drag force is a resistive force that consistently opposes motion. Its magnitude continuously increases as the relative speed between the object and the fluid increases. The force does not peak and then diminish at higher velocities.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis graph shows the drag force *F* having a very large (approaching infinite) value at a velocity close to zero and then decreasing as the velocity *v* increases. This is the opposite of the actual physical relationship. The drag force is zero when the object is at rest (*v* = 0) and increases with velocity.

It is the result of failing to account for the fact that the object of mass *m* rebounds. If its final velocity were incorrectly taken as positive (+\u00bd u) instead of negative (-\u00bd u), the momentum equation would be:\n*m*u = *m*(\u00bd u) + 4*m*v*\u2084\u2098\n\u00bd *m*u = 4*m*v*\u2084\u2098\n*v*\u2084\u2098 = u/8\nHowever, the problem states that the object rebounds, so its direction of motion is reversed, and its final velocity must be treated as negative.\n\n**B: 3u/16**\nThis result is typically due to an algebraic error in the final step of the calculation. The correct derivation leads to the equation \u00b3/\u2082 u = 4*v*\u2084\u2098. To find *v*\u2084\u2098, one must divide \u00b3/\u2082 u by 4, which correctly yields \u00b3u\u2044\u2088. An arithmetic mistake, such as misplacing a factor of 2, could lead to an incorrect answer like \u00b3u\u2044\u2081\u2086.\n\n**C: 5u/16**\nThis answer stems from a common misconception about the relationship between kinetic energy and speed. Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed (KE \u221d v\u00b2). If the kinetic energy is reduced to \u00bc of its original value, the speed is reduced by a factor of \u221a\u00bc, which is \u00bd. This incorrect answer is obtained by mistakenly assuming that the speed is also reduced to \u00bc of its original value (i.e., *v*\u2098 = u/4).\nUsing this incorrect speed in the momentum conservation equation gives:\n*m*u = *m*(-u/4) + 4*m*v*\u2084\u2098\n\u2075/\u2084 *m*u = 4*m*v*\u2084\u2098\n*v*\u2084\u2098 = \u2075u\u2044\u2081\u2086\nThis is incorrect because the final speed of the object of mass *m* is u/2, not u/4."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_91.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "11 the driver of a car applies two parallel forces to a steering wheel, as shown.\ncentre of\nsteering wheel\n15n\non 65\u00b0\n\u201cnw\n15na i\n; 1\n\u2018 0.40m \u2018\neach force has a magnitude of 15n and acts in the direction shown. the steering wheel has a\ndiameter of 0.40 m.\nwhat is the torque exerted on the steering wheel?\na 1.3nm b 2.5nm c 2.7nm d 54nm", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe total torque is the sum of the torques produced by each individual force.

Firstly, the component of the force parallel to the lever arm (radius) does not produce any turning effect; only the perpendicular component (given by Fsin(\u03b8)) contributes to the torque. Secondly, this calculation neglects the torque produced by the second force, which also contributes to the total turning effect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis value is obtained by correctly accounting for both forces but using the incorrect trigonometric function.

The upward force exerted on the water tank (the load) by the lever is determined by the effort (the force from the farmer) and the distances of the load and effort from the pivot.\n\nThe relationship is given by the equation for rotational equilibrium:\nAnticlockwise Moment = Clockwise Moment\n(Effort Force) \u00d7 (Effort Arm Distance) = (Load Force) \u00d7 (Load Arm Distance)\n\nLet F_effort be the constant force from the farmer, and F_load be the upward force on the tank.

This can be achieved by:\n1.  Increasing the effort arm distance (d_effort).\n2.  Decreasing the load arm distance (d_load).\n\nUsing a longer rod increases the total length available. As the force is applied at the end of the rod, this increases the effort arm (d_effort). Moving the pivot closer to the tank directly decreases the load arm (d_load). Both of these changes contribute to increasing the ratio (d_effort / d_load), and therefore **must** increase the upward force on the tank.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B) using a longer rod and moving the pivot further away from the tank**\n\nThis option involves two conflicting changes. Using a longer rod increases the effort arm (d_effort), which tends to increase the upward force. However, moving the pivot further away from the tank increases the load arm (d_load), which tends to decrease the upward force. The net effect on the ratio (d_effort / d_load) is ambiguous and depends on the magnitude of each change. It is not guaranteed that the upward force will increase; it could decrease or remain unchanged.\n\n**C) using a shorter rod and moving the pivot closer to the tank**\n\nThis option also involves two conflicting changes. Using a shorter rod decreases the effort arm (d_effort), which tends to decrease the upward force. Conversely, moving the pivot closer to the tank decreases the load arm (d_load), which tends to increase the upward force. Because these changes have opposing effects on the final force, it is not certain that the upward force will increase.\n\n**D) using a shorter rod and moving the pivot further away from the tank**\n\nBoth changes described in this option work against the goal of increasing the upward force. Using a shorter rod decreases the effort arm (d_effort), and moving the pivot further from the tank increases the load arm (d_load).

T\u00b2 = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2**\n\nThis relationship is correct because the ball is in a state of static equilibrium. According to Newton's First Law, for an object to be in equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces acting on it must be zero. The three forces acting on the ball are the tension (T), the horizontal force (P), and the weight (W).\n\nThere are two common methods to show this relationship:\n\n1.  **Vector Triangle Method:** Since the net force is zero, the three force vectors (T, P, and W) must form a closed triangle when added head-to-tail. The weight (W) acts vertically downwards, and the force (P) acts horizontally. Therefore, the vectors for W and P are perpendicular to each other. The tension (T) closes the triangle, forming the hypotenuse. In this right-angled triangle of forces, the Pythagorean theorem applies: the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Thus, T\u00b2 = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2.\n\n2.  **Resolving Components Method:** The forces can be resolved into horizontal and vertical components. For equilibrium, the sum of components in each direction must be zero.\n    *   **Vertical components:** The upward vertical component of the tension must balance the downward weight. The angle \u03b8 is with the vertical, so the vertical component of tension is T cos(\u03b8). Therefore, T cos(\u03b8) = W.\n    *   **Horizontal components:** The leftward horizontal component of the tension must balance the rightward force P. The horizontal component of tension is T sin(\u03b8). Therefore, T sin(\u03b8) = P.\n\n    By squaring and adding these two equations:\n    (T sin(\u03b8))\u00b2 + (T cos(\u03b8))\u00b2 = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2\n    T\u00b2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + T\u00b2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2\n    T\u00b2 (sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8)) = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1:\n    T\u00b2 = P\u00b2 + W\u00b2\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. P = T cos(\u03b8) and W = T sin(\u03b8)**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the components of the tension force. The angle \u03b8 is given with respect to the vertical axis. The component of tension adjacent to the angle \u03b8 is the vertical component, which balances the weight W. Therefore, the correct relationship is W = T cos(\u03b8). The component opposite to the angle \u03b8 is the horizontal component, which balances the force P. Thus, the correct relationship is P = T sin(\u03b8). Option A incorrectly swaps the sine and cosine functions.\n\n**B. T = P + W**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it treats vector quantities as scalars. Forces are vectors, possessing both magnitude and direction. They must be added using vector addition. A simple arithmetic sum of their magnitudes is only valid if the forces are collinear (acting along the same line) and in the same direction. In this case, P is horizontal, W is vertical, and T is at an angle. They are not collinear, so their magnitudes cannot be directly added. The correct relationship is a vector sum **T** + **P** + **W** = 0, which leads to the Pythagorean relationship described in option C.\n\n**D. W = P tan(\u03b8) and W = T cos(\u03b8)**\n\nThis statement is partially correct but ultimately wrong. The second equation, W = T cos(\u03b8), is a correct expression derived from resolving forces in the vertical direction. However, the first equation, W = P tan(\u03b8), is incorrect. By resolving forces, we find P = T sin(\u03b8) and W = T cos(\u03b8). Dividing the first equation by the second gives:\nP / W = (T sin(\u03b8)) / (T cos(\u03b8)) = tan(\u03b8).\nRearranging this gives P = W tan(\u03b8), or W = P / tan(\u03b8). The equation W = P tan(\u03b8) is therefore incorrect. Since one of the relationships in this option is incorrect, the entire option is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_94.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "14 which expression for pressure is correct?\na force per unit area\nb force per unit volume\nc_ mass per unit area\nd_ mass per unit volume", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nPressure is fundamentally defined as the amount of force applied perpendicularly to a surface, distributed over the area of that surface. The mathematical expression for pressure (P) is P = F/A, where F is the normal force and A is the area. This relationship is described in words as \"force per unit area.\" The standard SI unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), which is equivalent to one newton of force applied over an area of one square meter (N/m\u00b2).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) force per unit volume**\nThis expression describes force divided by volume (F/V). This is not the definition of pressure. Pressure is concerned with the distribution of force over a surface area, not through a volume. The units for force per unit volume would be newtons per cubic meter (N/m\u00b3), which are different from the units of pressure (N/m\u00b2 or Pa).\n\n**C) mass per unit area**\nThis expression defines a quantity called surface density (or areal density). It measures the mass distributed over a two-dimensional surface (m/A). While the weight (a force) of this mass would exert a pressure, \"mass per unit area\" is not pressure itself. Pressure is a measure of force, not mass, per unit area. The units for surface density are kg/m\u00b2, which are not the units for pressure.\n\n**D) mass per unit volume**\nThis expression is the definition of density (\u03c1 = m/V). Density is an intrinsic property of a substance that quantifies how much mass is contained within a given volume. It is a measure of the compactness of matter.

This is calculated as the product of the density of the fluid (\u03c1_water), the volume of the object submerged in the fluid (V_submerged), and the acceleration due to gravity (g).\n    *   U = \u03c1_water \u00d7 V_submerged \u00d7 g\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Condition:** For the floating ball, Weight = Upthrust.\n    *   m \u00d7 g = \u03c1_water \u00d7 V_submerged \u00d7 g\n\n4.  **Solving for Submerged Volume:** The term 'g' cancels from both sides of the equation, leaving:\n    *   m = \u03c1_water \u00d7 V_submerged\n    *   We can now solve for the volume of the ball that is submerged:\n    *   V_submerged = m / \u03c1_water\n    *   V_submerged = 0.50 kg / (1.0 \u00d7 10\u00b3 kg m\u207b\u00b3) = 0.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3\n\n5.  **Calculating the Percentage Submerged:** To find what fraction of the total volume is submerged, we divide the submerged volume by the total volume of the ball (V_ball).\n    *   Fraction submerged = V_submerged / V_ball\n    *   Fraction submerged = (0.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) / (1.3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) \u2248 0.3846\n\n6.  **Calculating the Percentage Above Water:** The question asks for the percentage of the volume *above* the water.

A value of 3.9% above the water would imply that 96.1% of the ball's volume is submerged. For this to occur, the ball's density would have to be 96.1% of the water's density, which would be approximately 961 kg m\u207b\u00b3. However, the calculated density of the ball is m/V = 0.50 kg / (1.3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) \u2248 385 kg m\u207b\u00b3. This discrepancy shows that the answer is incorrect.\n\n#### B: 38%\nThis answer is the result of a common misinterpretation of the question. The calculation correctly determines the percentage of the ball's volume that is *submerged* beneath the water's surface (38.46%, which rounds to 38%). However, the question asks for the percentage of the volume *above* the surface. This requires a final step: subtracting the submerged percentage from 100% (100% - 38% = 62%).\n\n#### D: 96%\nThis value is incorrect. A ball with 96% of its volume above the water would be floating very high, with only 4% of its volume submerged. This would only be possible if the ball's density were very low, specifically 4% of the density of water (i.e., 40 kg m\u207b\u00b3). The actual density of the ball is calculated as m/V = 0.50 kg / (1.3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) \u2248 385 kg m\u207b\u00b3, which is significantly higher.

The buggy is displaced horizontally by a distance (d) of 20 m. The force is applied at an angle (\u03b8) of 40\u00b0 to the horizontal direction of motion.\n\nOnly the component of the tension force that is parallel to the displacement does work.

It would be obtained if the sine of the angle was used instead of the cosine in the work done formula:\n\n*   W = F * d * sin(\u03b8)\n*   W = (200 N) * (20 m) * sin(40\u00b0)\n*   W \u2248 4000 * 0.643 \u2248 2571 J \u2248 2.6 kJ\n\nThis is conceptually incorrect. The term *F sin(\u03b8)* represents the component of the force perpendicular to the direction of motion. Since there is no displacement in the vertical direction, the vertical component of the force does no work. Work is only done by the component of the force parallel to the displacement, which is correctly calculated using *F cos(\u03b8)*.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis answer is incorrect. It does not correspond to a correct application of the work done formula or a common conceptual error. The work done is specifically calculated using the component of force in the direction of displacement (W = Fd cos(\u03b8)). Any calculation that results in 3.4 kJ must involve an incorrect value for the force, distance, or the angle, or a misapplication of the formula. The correct calculation, W = 200 * 20 * cos(40\u00b0), yields approximately 3.1 kJ.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis answer is incorrect. It results from neglecting the angle between the force and the displacement. This calculation would be:\n\n*   W = F * d\n*   W = 200 N * 20 m = 4000 J = 4.0 kJ\n\nThis is equivalent to assuming that the angle \u03b8 is 0\u00b0 (since cos(0\u00b0) = 1). This would only be correct if the pulling force was applied horizontally, parallel to the path of the buggy. However, the wire is at an angle of 40\u00b0 to the horizontal. Therefore, only the horizontal component of the tension (F cos(40\u00b0)) contributes to the work done in the horizontal direction.

This gravitational force causes a constant downward acceleration, which opposes the ball's initial upward velocity.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, defined by the equation KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2, where 'm' is the mass and 'v' is the velocity. As the ball rises, its upward velocity decreases, reaching zero at the peak of its trajectory. Consequently, its kinetic energy decreases throughout its ascent.\n*   **Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE):** Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position in a gravitational field, defined by GPE = mgh, where 'h' is the height above a reference point. As the ball rises, its height 'h' above the Earth's surface increases. Therefore, its gravitational potential energy increases.\n\nThis process illustrates the principle of conservation of energy. The initial kinetic energy imparted to the ball is converted into gravitational potential energy as it gains height. Thus, the kinetic energy decreases as the gravitational potential energy increases.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The kinetic energy of the ball decreases as the gravitational potential energy decreases.**\nThis statement is incorrect because while the kinetic energy does decrease as the ball rises, its gravitational potential energy increases. Gravitational potential energy (GPE = mgh) is directly proportional to the height (h) of the object. As the ball moves upwards, its height increases, leading to an increase, not a decrease, in its GPE.\n\n**C: The kinetic energy of the ball increases as the gravitational potential energy decreases.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the kinetic energy of the ball decreases as it rises because its velocity is reduced by the force of gravity. Secondly, the gravitational potential energy increases as the ball gains height. This statement accurately describes the energy transformation of a ball that is falling, not one that is rising.\n\n**D: The total energy of the ball increases.**\nThis statement violates the principle of conservation of energy. Once the ball leaves the hand, no external agent is doing work on it to add energy to the system. In an ideal scenario without air resistance, the total mechanical energy (the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy) would remain constant. In the real-world scenario implied by the phrase \"through the air,\" air resistance acts as a dissipative force, doing negative work on the ball.

This requires adjustments to both the horizontal (time) and vertical (amplitude) scaling.\n\n1.  **Time-base (Horizontal Axis):** The time-base control sets the horizontal scale, typically in units of time per division (e.g., ms/div). The initial trace shows only about half of a complete cycle stretched across the entire screen. To display one full cycle, the waveform must be compressed horizontally. This is achieved by making the electron beam sweep more slowly across the screen, thus capturing a longer time interval. Therefore, the **time-base setting must be increased** (a larger value of time per division).\n\n2.  **y-gain (Vertical Axis):** The y-gain control sets the vertical scale, representing the input voltage per division (V/div). The initial trace shows the peak of the waveform extending beyond the top of the screen. This means the vertical deflection is too large for the current setting. To fit the entire amplitude (both the positive peak and the negative trough) of the waveform on the screen, the vertical representation must be scaled down. Increasing the y-gain setting (a larger value of volts per division) reduces the vertical deflection for a given input voltage. Therefore, the **y-gain must be increased**.\n\nCombining these two requirements, both the time-base and the y-gain must be increased.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decrease time-base, decrease y-gain**\n\nThis is incorrect.

This means there is always a component of the car's velocity directed towards the observer. A source moving towards a stationary observer results in the observer perceiving a frequency higher than the source frequency (*f'* > *f*). The sound waves are effectively \"compressed,\" leading to more wavefronts reaching the observer per unit time. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n2.  **Frequency Trend (Increasing or Decreasing):** The magnitude of the frequency shift depends on the magnitude of the radial velocity.\n    *   At a point P far from Q, the car is moving almost directly towards the observer. The angle between the car's velocity vector and the line of sight to the observer is small, so the radial velocity is close to the car's full speed. This results in the maximum observed frequency.\n    *   As the car moves closer to Q, the angle between its velocity vector and the line of sight increases. Consequently, the component of velocity towards the observer (the radial velocity) decreases.\n    *   At point Q, the car's velocity is perpendicular to the line of sight. At this instant, the radial velocity is zero, and the observed frequency is momentarily equal to the source frequency, *f*.\n    *   Since the radial velocity of approach continuously decreases as the car moves from P to Q, the upward shift in frequency also continuously decreases.

As the car moves from P to Q, its distance to the observer at O is decreasing, which leads to an observed frequency greater than *f*.\n\n#### B: a frequency less than *f* that increases as the car moves from P towards Q\n\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option A, the observed frequency must be greater than *f* because the source is approaching the observer. Secondly, the frequency trend is incorrect; the rate of approach decreases as the car moves from P to Q, which causes the observed frequency to decrease, not increase.\n\n#### D: a frequency more than *f* that increases as the car moves from P towards Q\n\nThis is incorrect because of the frequency trend. While it correctly identifies that the observed frequency is more than *f*, it incorrectly states that this frequency increases. An increasing frequency would imply that the car's rate of approach is increasing.

To do this, one must know the general order of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum, arranged in order of increasing wavelength, is: Gamma rays, X-rays, Ultraviolet, Visible light (Violet to Red), Infrared, Microwaves, and Radio waves.\n\nLet's evaluate the wavelength of the radiation from each source:\n1.  **a radio wave transmitter:** Emits radio waves, which have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum (typically > 1 meter).\n2.  **a source of X-rays:** Emits X-rays, which have very short wavelengths (typically 10\u207b\u2078 m to 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m), shorter than visible light.\n3.  **a 30 mm wavelength radar transmitter:** Radar uses microwaves. The wavelength is explicitly given as 30 mm, which is 0.03 m. This wavelength is longer than visible light but shorter than typical radio waves.\n4.  **a light-emitting diode that emits red light:** Emits visible light. Red light has a wavelength of approximately 700 nm (7 x 10\u207b\u2077 m), which is longer than X-rays but shorter than microwaves.\n\nNow, let's arrange these wavelengths in increasing order:\n-   **Shortest:** X-rays (Source 2)\n-   **Next:** Red light (Source 4) (7 x 10\u207b\u2077 m is less than 0.03 m)\n-   **Next:** Radar/Microwaves (Source 3) (0.03 m is less than typical radio wave wavelengths)\n-   **Longest:** Radio waves (Source 1)\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the sources for increasing wavelength is 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 1.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 2**\nThis sequence orders the sources by decreasing wavelength.

For this principle to be physically meaningful, the quantities being added must be of the same nature. For example, the displacement of a transverse wave on a string can be added to the displacement of another transverse wave on the same string. Similarly, the pressure variations of two sound waves can be superposed. However, it is not possible to add the pressure variation of a sound wave to the electric field oscillation of a light wave. Therefore, the most fundamental condition for superposition to occur is that the waves must be of the same type.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The waves must be coherent.**\nCoherence means that the waves have a constant phase difference between them. While coherence is a necessary condition for the formation of a stable and observable interference pattern (a specific outcome of superposition), it is not required for the principle of superposition itself. Superposition occurs whenever waves meet, regardless of their phase relationship. If the waves are incoherent (their phase difference changes randomly), superposition still happens at every instant, but the resulting interference effects will fluctuate rapidly and average out, making a stable pattern unobservable.\n\n**C. The waves must be travelling in opposite directions.**\nThis is the specific condition required for the formation of a standing (or stationary) wave. A standing wave is a special case resulting from the superposition of two waves of the same type, frequency, and amplitude travelling in opposite directions. However, superposition is a more general principle and also occurs when waves travel in the same direction or at an angle to each other. Therefore, travelling in opposite directions is not a necessary condition for superposition to occur.\n\n**D. The waves must meet in phase.**\nMeeting in phase (i.e., having a phase difference of zero or an integer multiple of 2\u03c0) is the condition for maximum constructive interference, where the resultant amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes. Superposition also includes destructive interference, which occurs when waves meet out of phase (e.g., in antiphase, with a phase difference of \u03c0 or an odd integer multiple of \u03c0). In fact, superposition occurs for any phase difference between the waves. The phase relationship simply determines the nature of the interference (constructive, destructive, or intermediate), but it is not a prerequisite for superposition to take place."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_106.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "26 asstring is stretched between a vibration generator and a fixed point.\nwhen the vibration generator is vibrating at a frequency f, a stationary wave with five nodes is\ncreated on the stretched string, as shown. there is a node at the end of the string that is attached\nto the vibration generator.\nfixed point\n\nvibration\n\ngenerator\nthe frequency of vibration of the vibration generator is slowly increased.\nwhat is the next frequency that produces a stationary wave on the string?\na 1.25f b 1.50f c 1.75f d = 2.00f", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: A\n\nA stationary wave on a string fixed at both ends can only exist at specific resonant frequencies, known as harmonics. The condition for the formation of a stationary wave is that the length of the string, *L*, must be an integer multiple of half a wavelength, \u03bb. This is expressed as L = n(\u03bb/2), where *n* is an integer (n=1, 2, 3,...) representing the number of antinodes (loops).\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (*v*), frequency (*f*), and wavelength (\u03bb) is *v* = *f*\u03bb. Combining these equations gives the formula for the resonant frequencies: f_n = n(v/2L). This shows that the allowed frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, f\u2081 = v/2L.\n\nThe initial stationary wave is described as having five nodes. For a string fixed at both ends, the number of nodes is always one more than the number of antinodes (*n*). Therefore, if there are 5 nodes, there must be n = 5 - 1 = 4 antinodes. This corresponds to the 4th harmonic. The initial frequency, *f*, is thus f\u2084 = 4(v/2L).\n\nWhen the frequency is increased, the next stationary wave will be the next possible harmonic, which is the 5th harmonic (n=5). The frequency of this new wave, f_new, will be f\u2085 = 5(v/2L).\n\nTo find the relationship between f_new and *f*, we can take their ratio:\nf_new / f = [5(v/2L)] / [4(v/2L)] = 5/4 = 1.25.\nTherefore, the next frequency that produces a stationary wave is f_new = 1.25f.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. 1.50f**\nThe resonant frequencies for a string fixed at both ends are given by f_n = n \u00d7 f\u2081, where f\u2081 is the fundamental frequency and *n* is an integer (the harmonic number). The initial state corresponds to the 4th harmonic (n=4), so the initial frequency is f = 4f\u2081. The next resonant frequency occurs at the next integer value of *n*, which is n=5. The frequency would be f\u2085 = 5f\u2081 = (5/4) \u00d7 4f\u2081 = 1.25f. A frequency of 1.50f would correspond to a harmonic number n' such that n'/4 = 1.50, which gives n' = 6. This represents the 6th harmonic, not the *next* harmonic after the 4th. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C. 1.75f**\nResonant frequencies on a string of fixed length occur at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency (f_n = n \u00d7 f\u2081). The initial frequency *f* corresponds to the 4th harmonic (n=4), as determined by the five nodes. Thus, f = 4f\u2081. The next possible stationary wave would be the 5th harmonic (n=5), with a frequency of f\u2085 = 5f\u2081 = 1.25f. A frequency of 1.75f would imply a ratio of 1.75 relative to the 4th harmonic's frequency. This would require a harmonic number n' where n'/4 = 1.75, giving n' = 7. The 7th harmonic is a valid resonant frequency, but it is not the *next* one after the 4th.\n\n**D. 2.00f**\nThe allowed frequencies for stationary waves on a string fixed at both ends are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (f_n = n \u00d7 f\u2081, where n=1, 2, 3,...). The initial wave has five nodes, which corresponds to four antinodes (n=4), so the initial frequency is the 4th harmonic, f = 4f\u2081. The next stationary wave will form at the next integer harmonic, n=5, which has a frequency of f\u2085 = 5f\u2081 = 1.25f. A frequency of 2.00f would be twice the initial frequency, f' = 2f = 2(4f\u2081) = 8f\u2081. This corresponds to the 8th harmonic (n=8).

The amount of diffraction, which is the spreading of waves as they pass through a gap, is most significant when the wavelength of the wave (\u03bb) is large compared to the width of the gap (w). To increase the amount of diffraction, the ratio \u03bb/w must be increased.\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the wave equation: v = f\u03bb.\n\nFor water waves in a ripple tank, the speed (v) is determined by the depth of the water, which is assumed to be constant. Therefore, v is constant. This means that wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency (\u03bb \u221d 1/f).\n\nIf the frequency (f) is halved, the new wavelength (\u03bb') will be double the original wavelength (\u03bb' = v / (f/2) = 2(v/f) = 2\u03bb).\n\nBy doubling the wavelength, the ratio \u03bb/w is also doubled. A larger \u03bb/w ratio leads to a greater degree of diffraction. Therefore, halving the frequency of the ripples increases the amount of diffraction observed.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. double the amplitude of the ripples**\n\nThis is incorrect. The amplitude of a wave is a measure of its maximum displacement from the equilibrium position and is related to the energy or intensity of the wave. While doubling the amplitude would make the diffracted ripples taller and more energetic, it does not affect the wavelength (\u03bb) or the gap width (w). The extent to which the waves spread out (the diffraction angle) depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the gap width (\u03bb/w). Since this ratio remains unchanged, the amount of diffraction is not affected.\n\n**B. double the width of the gap**\n\nThis is incorrect. Diffraction is most pronounced when the gap width (w) is close to or smaller than the wavelength (\u03bb). Increasing the gap width while keeping the wavelength constant decreases the ratio \u03bb/w. A smaller \u03bb/w ratio results in less diffraction; the waves will pass through the wider gap with less spreading, behaving more like straight wavefronts. This change would decrease, not increase, the amount of diffraction observed.\n\n**D. halve the wavelength of the ripples**\n\nThis is incorrect. To increase the amount of diffraction, the wavelength (\u03bb) should be increased relative to the gap width (w). Halving the wavelength would decrease the ratio \u03bb/w.

When charge flows through an electrical component, electrical potential energy is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat, light, or mechanical energy). The potential difference across the component quantifies this energy transfer for each unit of charge that passes through it.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula:\n*   V = E / Q\nWhere:\n*   V is the potential difference in volts (V)\n*   E is the energy transferred in joules (J)\n*   Q is the charge in coulombs (C)\n\nTherefore, one volt is equivalent to one joule per coulomb (1 V = 1 J/C).\n\n***\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the charge per unit time passing through the component**\nThis phrase defines electric current (I). Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge. It is calculated as I = Q/t, where Q is the charge passing a point in time t. The unit of current is the ampere (A), which is equivalent to one coulomb per second (C/s). This is distinct from potential difference.\n\n**C: the force per unit charge**\nThis phrase defines electric field strength (E). Electric field strength at a point is the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point. It is calculated as E = F/q, where F is the electric force on a test charge q. The unit of electric field strength is newtons per coulomb (N/C). This is a different physical quantity from potential difference.\n\n**D: the resistance per unit current**\nThis phrase does not define any standard physical quantity. Resistance (R) is defined by Ohm's law as the ratio of the potential difference (V) across a component to the current (I) flowing through it (R = V/I).

The relationship between current (I) and potential difference (V) for a filament lamp is shown by graph D.\n\n1.  **Heating Effect:** When a potential difference is applied across the filament, a current flows. This current causes the filament (typically made of tungsten, a metal) to heat up due to the Joule heating effect.\n2.  **Resistance and Temperature:** For metallic conductors, resistance increases as temperature increases. As the voltage and current through the filament increase, its temperature rises significantly, causing a substantial increase in its resistance.\n3.  **I-V Graph Interpretation:** The resistance (R) at any point on the graph is given by the ratio V/I. The gradient of the I-V graph represents the change in current with respect to voltage (dI/dV), which is the reciprocal of the dynamic resistance (dV/dI). As the resistance of the filament increases with temperature (and thus with increasing voltage), a larger increase in voltage is required to produce the same increase in current. This means the gradient (dI/dV) of the I-V graph must decrease as the voltage increases. Graph D correctly shows a curve that starts at the origin and becomes less steep (its gradient decreases) as V increases, indicating an increasing resistance.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n#### A\nThis graph shows the I-V characteristic of a semiconductor diode in forward bias. A diode has a very high resistance for voltages below a certain threshold value (typically ~0.7 V for silicon). Above this threshold, the resistance drops dramatically, and a large current flows for a small increase in voltage. This behaviour is fundamentally different from that of a metallic filament lamp, whose resistance gradually and continuously increases with temperature.\n\n#### B\nThis graph shows a straight line passing through the origin, which represents a component that obeys Ohm's law. In such a component, the current is directly proportional to the potential difference (I \u221d V), and the resistance (R = V/I) is constant. This describes an ohmic conductor, such as a fixed resistor kept at a constant temperature. A filament lamp is non-ohmic because its temperature, and therefore its resistance, changes significantly during operation.\n\n#### C\nThis graph shows a curve where the gradient (dI/dV) increases as the voltage increases. This indicates that the resistance of the component is *decreasing* as it heats up. This is the characteristic behaviour of a thermistor, specifically a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor. In a filament lamp, the filament is a metal, and its resistance *increases* with temperature, which is the opposite of the behaviour shown in this graph."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_113.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "33 a metal wire has a length of 2.50m and a cross-sectional area of 4.50 x 10m\u2019. the resistivity of\nthe metal is 3.50 x 107qm.\nthe wire is stretched so that its length increases to 2.65m. the wire remains cylindrical and the\nvolume of the wire remains constant.\nwhat is the change in the resistance of the wire?\na 0.0120 b 0.0249 c 0.192 d 0.220", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe resistance *R* of a wire is given by the formula *R* = \u03c1*L*/*A*, where \u03c1 is the resistivity of the material, *L* is the length of the wire, and *A* is its cross-sectional area.\n\nFirst, calculate the initial resistance, *R*\u2081, of the wire using the initial values:\n*   *L*\u2081 = 2.50 m\n*   *A*\u2081 = 4.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2\n*   \u03c1 = 3.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 \u03a9\u00b7m\n\n*R*\u2081 = (3.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 \u03a9\u00b7m \u00d7 2.50 m) / (4.50 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2) = 0.1944... \u03a9\n\nThe wire is stretched, so its length increases and its cross-sectional area decreases.

The total resistance is the sum of the external fixed resistance (R) and the battery's internal resistance (r). The ammeter measures this total current (I). According to Ohm's law for the complete circuit:\nI = \u03b5 / (R + r)\n\nThe voltmeter measures the terminal potential difference (V) across the fixed resistor R, which is given by:\nV = I * R\n\nWhen the battery is replaced, the e.m.f.

This means the **ammeter reading decreases**.\n\nNow, consider the new voltmeter reading, V'. It is the potential difference across the fixed resistor R:\nV' = I' * R\n\nSince the current I' has decreased and the resistance R is fixed, the product I' * R will be smaller than the original product I * R.

Since the total current (I) in the circuit decreases due to the increased internal resistance, and the external resistance (R) is constant, the potential difference across it must also decrease.\n\n**C: stays the same, decreases**\nThis is incorrect because the ammeter reading does not stay the same. The ammeter measures the total current flowing from the battery. The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the external and internal resistances (R + r). When the internal resistance (r) increases, the total resistance of the circuit increases. For a constant e.m.f., an increase in total resistance will cause the current to decrease, as per I = \u03b5 / (R + r).\n\n**D: stays the same, stays the same**\nThis is incorrect because both the current and the terminal potential difference are affected by the change in internal resistance. An increase in internal resistance leads to an increase in the total circuit resistance, which causes the current to decrease. The decrease in current, in turn, causes the potential difference across the external resistor to decrease.

A reading of 0 V at point P would only be possible if the potential at P (0 V) were the same as the potential at the voltmeter's other terminal. However, the other terminal is at -3 V, resulting in a potential difference of 3 V. The reading at Q is 6 V, not 3 V.\n\n**B: 0 V, 6 V**\nThis option is incorrect because the reading at P is 3 V, not 0 V. While the reading at Q is correctly stated as 6 V, the value for P is wrong.

The volume (V) of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius. Since the diameter (d) is measured, and d = 2r, the volume formula can be expressed in terms of diameter as V = (4/3)\u03c0(d/2)\u00b3 = (1/6)\u03c0d\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, the formula for density in terms of the measured quantities is:\n\u03c1 = m / [(1/6)\u03c0d\u00b3] = 6m / (\u03c0d\u00b3)\n\nTo find the percentage uncertainty in a calculated quantity involving multiplication, division, and powers, we add the percentage uncertainties of the individual measurements.

Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. This means that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by an external net force. According to Newton's second law of motion (F = ma), for a given net force (F), the acceleration (a) produced is inversely proportional to the object's mass (m). Therefore, an object with a larger mass has greater inertia and offers more resistance to a change in its motion (i.e., acceleration).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the force the object experiences due to gravity**\nThis statement defines the **weight** of an object, not its mass. Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object and is calculated as the product of its mass and the gravitational field strength (W = mg). While mass is an intrinsic, scalar property of an object that remains constant regardless of its location, weight is a force (a vector quantity) that can change depending on the strength of the local gravitational field.\n\n**B: the momentum of the object before a collision**\nThis statement describes the **momentum** of an object, which is a measure of its motion. Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity (p = mv). An object must be in motion to have non-zero momentum, but it possesses mass whether it is moving or at rest. Therefore, momentum is a property dependent on both mass and velocity, not a description of mass itself.\n\n**D: the weight of the object as measured by a balance**\nThis statement is conceptually incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, **weight** is a force, while a **balance** (such as a beam balance or a top-pan electronic balance) is an instrument designed to measure **mass**. It does so by comparing the weight of an unknown object to the weight of known standard masses in the same gravitational field. Secondly, a description of how a quantity is measured is not the fundamental definition of the quantity itself.

The forces in the vertical direction are the upward buoyant force (upthrust, `U`) and the downward gravitational force (initial weight, `W\u2081`).\n    According to Newton's First Law, for an object at rest, the forces are balanced:\n    `U = W\u2081`\n    The initial weight is `W\u2081 = m\u2081g`, where `m\u2081 = 3200 kg` is the initial mass and `g` is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately `9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2`).\n    Therefore, the upthrust is `U = 3200 \u00d7 g`.\n\n2.  **State After Mass Change (Accelerating):**\n    The submarine's mass is reduced by `200 kg`. The new mass, `m\u2082`, is:\n    `m\u2082 = 3200 kg - 200 kg = 3000 kg`\n    The new weight, `W\u2082`, is `W\u2082 = m\u2082g = 3000 \u00d7 g`.\n    The problem states that the upthrust, `U`, remains unchanged because the volume of the submarine is constant. So, `U = 3200 \u00d7 g`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Acceleration:**\n    Immediately after the mass is reduced, there is a net upward force, `F_net`, because the upthrust is now greater than the weight.\n    `F_net = U - W\u2082`\n    `F_net = (3200 \u00d7 g) - (3000 \u00d7 g) = 200 \u00d7 g`\n\n    According to Newton's Second Law, `F_net = ma`. The mass that is accelerating is the new mass, `m\u2082`.\n    `F_net = m\u2082a`\n    `200 \u00d7 g = 3000 \u00d7 a`\n\n    Now, we solve for the acceleration, `a`:\n    `a = (200 \u00d7 g) / 3000`\n    `a = (200 \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2) / 3000`\n    `a = 1962 / 3000`\n    `a = 0.654 m s\u207b\u00b2`\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 0.613 m s\u207b\u00b2\nThis result is obtained if the net force is divided by the *initial* mass (`m\u2081 = 3200 kg`) instead of the new, accelerating mass (`m\u2082 = 3000 kg`). The net force causes the object with its current mass to accelerate. The calculation would be: `a = (200 \u00d7 9.81) / 3200 = 0.613 m s\u207b\u00b2`. This is incorrect because the mass that is accelerating is `3000 kg`.\n\n#### C: 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2\nThis value is the acceleration due to gravity, `g`. An object accelerates at `g` only when it is in freefall, meaning the only force acting on it is its weight. In this scenario, the submarine is subject to a large upthrust force, which counteracts most of its weight. The net force is only the *difference* between the upthrust and the new weight, not the full weight itself.\n\n#### D: 10.5 m s\u207b\u00b2\nThis value would be obtained if the net force was incorrectly assumed to be the total upthrust (`F_net = U`) and this force was applied to the new mass (`m\u2082`). The calculation would be: `a = U / m\u2082 = (3200 \u00d7 9.81) / 3000 \u2248 10.5 m s\u207b\u00b2`. This is incorrect because the net force is the *resultant* of all forces acting on the object.

The forces opposing the motion are the frictional force and air resistance.\n\n1.  **Total Resistive Force:** The total resistive force is the sum of the frictional force from the slope and the force of air resistance. The problem states that the frictional force is constant. However, air resistance is a type of fluid friction that increases as the speed of the object increases. Since the box is sliding with increasing speed, the force of air resistance acting on it also increases. Therefore, the total resistive force (constant friction + increasing air resistance) must increase as the box moves from P to Q.\n\n2.  **Acceleration:** According to Newton's Second Law, the net force on the box is equal to its mass times its acceleration (`F_net = ma`). The net force is the difference between the constant driving force (component of weight) and the total resistive force.\n    `F_net = (mg sin\u03b8) - F_total_resistive`\n    As the box accelerates down the slope, the total resistive force increases.

The total resistive force is the sum of a constant frictional force and an increasing air resistance (due to increasing speed), so it must increase, not decrease. Consequently, with a constant driving force and an increasing total resistive force, the net force decreases, causing the acceleration to decrease, not increase.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly states that the acceleration decreases but incorrectly states that the total resistive force also decreases. The total resistive force is composed of a constant frictional force and air resistance. As the speed of the box increases, the air resistance increases. This means the total resistive force (the sum of constant friction and increasing air resistance) must increase, not decrease.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option correctly states that the total resistive force increases but incorrectly states that the acceleration also increases. The acceleration is determined by the net force (`F_net = F_driving - F_resistive`). While the driving force (component of weight) is constant, the total resistive force is increasing.

This would imply that the force F acts perpendicularly to the rod, which is not the case. The calculation would be 10.0 \u00d7 (L/2) = F \u00d7 L, leading to F = 5.0 N. This is incorrect because only the component of F perpendicular to the rod (F sin(30\u00b0)) contributes to the turning moment.\n\n#### B) 8.7 N\nThis value is likely the result of an error in applying trigonometry. For example, one might mistakenly use the cosine of the angle instead of the sine when calculating the vertical component of the force, or confuse the roles of the angles provided. The correct application of the principle of moments and trigonometry, as shown above, leads to a value of 10 N.\n\n#### D) 20 N\nThis value arises from a misunderstanding of where the weight of a uniform object acts. If the weight of the rod (10.0 N) were assumed to act at the end Y (at distance L) instead of at its center (at distance L/2), the clockwise moment would be 10.0 \u00d7 L. Equating this to the counter-clockwise moment (F sin(30\u00b0)) \u00d7 L gives 10.0 = F \u00d7 0.5, which results in F = 20 N.

Since the slope is frictionless and air resistance is negligible, the total mechanical energy (the sum of kinetic and potential energy) of the block remains constant. The loss in gravitational potential energy (GPE) as the block slides down the slope is converted into a gain in kinetic energy (KE).\n\n1.  **Gain in Kinetic Energy (KE):** The block starts from rest (initial velocity, u = 0) and reaches a final speed, v. The gain in KE is given by:\n    \u0394KE = Final KE - Initial KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2 - 0 = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n    where 'm' is the mass of the block.\n\n2.  **Loss in Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE):** The block slides a distance 'x' down a slope inclined at an angle '\u03b8'. The vertical height 'h' that the block descends is related to 'x' and '\u03b8' by trigonometry:\n    sin(\u03b8) = opposite / hypotenuse = h / x\n    Therefore, h = x sin(\u03b8).\n    The loss in GPE is:\n    \u0394GPE = mgh = mg(x sin\u03b8)\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** Equating the gain in KE to the loss in GPE:\n    \u00bdmv\u00b2 = mgx sin\u03b8\n\n4.  **Solving for Final Speed (v):**\n    *   Divide both sides by 'm': \u00bdv\u00b2 = gx sin\u03b8\n    *   Multiply both sides by 2: v\u00b2 = 2gx sin\u03b8\n    *   Take the square root of both sides: v = \u221a(2gx sin\u03b8)\n\nAlternatively, using dynamics:\n1.

The derivation using either conservation of energy (\u00bdv\u00b2 = gx sin\u03b8) or kinematics (v\u00b2 = 2ax, where a = g sin\u03b8) leads to v\u00b2 = 2gx sin\u03b8. This option incorrectly divides the term inside the square root by 2, which would imply v\u00b2 = gx sin\u03b8 / 2. This result does not follow from the fundamental principles of energy conservation or Newtonian dynamics.\n\n**C: \u221a(2gx)**\nThis expression would be correct for an object in free fall (i.e., dropped vertically) from a height 'x'. In that case, the acceleration is 'g' and the vertical distance is 'x', so from v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as, we get v\u00b2 = 2gx. However, the block is sliding down a slope. The acceleration along the slope is not 'g', but its component, g sin\u03b8. Also, the vertical height descended is not 'x', but h = x sin\u03b8. This option incorrectly assumes the acceleration is 'g' over the distance 'x' or that the vertical drop is equal to the distance slid along the slope.\n\n**D: 2gx sin\u03b8**\nThis expression represents the square of the final speed (v\u00b2), not the final speed (v) itself. The correct derivation shows that v\u00b2 = 2gx sin\u03b8. To find the speed 'v', it is necessary to take the square root of this expression.

It is related to the wave's frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) by the wave equation: speed (v) = f \u00d7 \u03bb. While the CRO can be used to find the frequency of the sound wave, it provides no information about its wavelength.

A positive displacement indicates movement to the right, and a negative displacement indicates movement to the left.\n\nTo find a compression, we must identify a point where particles have converged. Let's analyse the region around point B:\n*   Particles immediately to the left of B (between A and B) have a positive displacement, meaning they have moved to the right, towards B.\n*   Particles immediately to the right of B (between B and C) have a negative displacement, meaning they have moved to the left, also towards B.\n*   The particle at B itself is at its equilibrium position (zero displacement).\n\nSince particles on both sides of B are moving towards it, the region around B becomes crowded. This \"bunching up\" of particles is the definition of a compression.\n\nAlternatively, a compression can be identified as a point where the gradient of the displacement-distance graph is maximally negative. The pressure variation is proportional to the negative of the spatial derivative of the displacement (P \u221d -\u2202y/\u2202x). A compression (maximum pressure) corresponds to the most negative slope on the displacement-distance graph. Point B is located at the part of the curve with the steepest negative gradient.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A\nAt point A, the displacement is at its maximum positive value. This means the particle at position A has moved the furthest to the right from its equilibrium position. The slope of the graph at this point is zero, indicating that particles in the immediate vicinity have nearly the same large positive displacement. This represents the centre of a region where particles are displaced to the right, not a region where they are bunched together. Therefore, A is not a compression.\n\n#### C\nAt point C, the displacement is at its maximum negative value. This means the particle at position C has moved the furthest to the left from its equilibrium position. The slope of the graph at this point is zero, indicating that particles in the immediate vicinity have nearly the same large negative displacement. This represents the centre of a region where particles are displaced to the left, not a region of compression.\n\n#### D\nPoint D represents a rarefaction, which is the opposite of a compression.

When the source of the waves (X) is moving away from a stationary detector (Y), each successive wavefront is emitted from a position that is farther from the detector. This has the effect of 'stretching' the distance between the wavefronts, leading to an increase in the observed wavelength (\u03bb'). The speed of the sound wave (v) in the medium remains constant. According to the wave equation, v = f\u03bb, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (f = v/\u03bb). Therefore, an increase in the observed wavelength results in a decrease in the observed frequency. The detected frequency will be less than the source frequency *f*.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Diffraction is the spreading of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. While the sound wave might undergo some diffraction, this process affects the amplitude and direction of the wave, not its frequency. The frequency of a wave is determined by its source and does not change due to diffraction.\n\n**B:** Reflection is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media, causing the wavefront to return into the medium from which it originated. Reflection of a wave from a stationary object does not alter the wave's frequency. The frequency remains constant, equal to the frequency of the source.\n\n**D:** According to the Doppler effect, if the source X were moving towards the stationary detector Y, the wavefronts would be compressed. This means the observed wavelength would be shorter than the source wavelength.

The light incident on the second filter is polarised at 45\u00b0 to the vertical, and the filter's axis is horizontal. The angle between these two directions is 45\u00b0, not 90\u00b0. Therefore, the final intensity is non-zero. A common mistake is to consider only the initial vertical polarisation and the final horizontal filter, which are perpendicular. However, the first filter rotates the plane of polarisation, allowing some light to pass through the second filter.\n\n**C.

In this problem, the light is never aligned with the transmission axis of a filter it is about to pass through (the angles are 45\u00b0 for both filters).

A stationary wave is formed by the superposition of two progressive waves. For a stable stationary wave to form, the two progressive waves must be coherent, meaning they have the same frequency and their sources have a constant phase difference. However, the phase difference between the two waves themselves is not constant along the medium. It varies with position.\n\nLet the two progressive waves be represented by the equations:\n*   Wave 1 (travelling in the +x direction): y\u2081 = A sin(\u03c9t - kx)\n*   Wave 2 (travelling in the -x direction): y\u2082 = A sin(\u03c9t + kx)\n\nThe phase of Wave 1 is (\u03c9t - kx) and the phase of Wave 2 is (\u03c9t + kx). The phase difference (\u0394\u03c6) between them at any point x and time t is:\n\u0394\u03c6 = (\u03c9t + kx) - (\u03c9t - kx) = 2kx\n\nThis shows that the phase difference depends on the position, x. For example:\n*   At an antinode (e.g., x = 0, \u03bb/2, \u03bb, ...), the phase difference is a multiple of 2\u03c0, meaning the waves are in phase, leading to constructive interference.\n*   At a node (e.g., x = \u03bb/4, 3\u03bb/4, ...), the phase difference is an odd multiple of \u03c0, meaning the waves are in antiphase, leading to destructive interference.\n\nSince the phase difference is a function of position and not a single constant value, the statement that the two waves must have a constant phase difference is not correct.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B: They must have the same frequency.** This statement is correct. For a stable interference pattern, such as a stationary wave with fixed nodes and antinodes, the two waves must be coherent. A fundamental condition for coherence is that the waves have the same frequency. If the frequencies were different, the phase relationship between the waves would constantly change at every point, and a stable stationary wave would not be formed.\n\n*   **C: They must have the same wavelength.** This statement is correct. The speed of a wave (v) is related to its frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) by the wave equation v = f\u03bb. Since the two progressive waves are travelling in the same medium, their speeds must be the same (see D). As established in B, their frequencies must also be the same. Therefore, for the equation v = f\u03bb to hold true for both waves, their wavelengths must also be identical.\n\n*   **D: They must travel at the same speed.** This statement is correct. A stationary wave is formed by the interference of two waves travelling through the same medium (e.g., a wave and its reflection in a string or an air column). The speed of a mechanical wave is determined by the physical properties of the medium it travels through (like tension and mass per unit length for a string, or bulk modulus and density for sound in air).

For a stationary wave in such a tube, a displacement node (point of minimum displacement) must form at the closed end, and a displacement antinode (point of maximum displacement) must form at the open end.\n\nThe stationary wave is described as having two nodes and two antinodes. Let L be the length of the tube and \u03bb be the wavelength of the sound.\n1.  The first node is at the closed end (bottom).\n2.  The distance from a node to the next antinode is \u03bb/4.\n3.  The distance from an antinode to the next node is \u03bb/4.\n4.  The pattern from the bottom is: Node \u2192 Antinode \u2192 Node \u2192 Antinode.\n5.  The total length of the tube accommodates these segments:\n    L = (distance from 1st node to 1st antinode) + (distance from 1st antinode to 2nd node) + (distance from 2nd node to 2nd antinode)\n    L = (\u03bb/4) + (\u03bb/4) + (\u03bb/4) = 3\u03bb/4\n\nThe length of the tube is given as L = 60 cm = 0.60 m.

The closest option is 430 Hz. The small discrepancy may be due to the rounding of the value for the speed of sound. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it results from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the tube length and the wavelength of the stationary wave. A frequency of 570 Hz would imply a wavelength of \u03bb = v / f = 340 / 570 \u2248 0.60 m. This value for the wavelength would be obtained if one incorrectly assumed that the length of the tube, L, is equal to one full wavelength (L = \u03bb). For L = 0.60 m, this would give f = v / L = 340 / 0.60 \u2248 567 Hz, which is close to 570 Hz. However, the stationary wave pattern shown, with two nodes and two antinodes in a pipe closed at one end, corresponds to a length L = 3\u03bb/4, not L = \u03bb.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect. A frequency of 850 Hz would require a wavelength of \u03bb = v / f = 340 / 850 = 0.40 m. This wavelength would be derived from an incorrect interpretation of the stationary wave diagram. The diagram shows one complete \"loop\" and one \"half-loop\". A common mistake is to assume that the length of the tube is equal to one and a half wavelengths (L = 1.5\u03bb or L = 3\u03bb/2). This would give \u03bb = L / 1.5 = 0.60 / 1.5 = 0.40 m, which leads to the frequency f = 340 / 0.40 = 850 Hz. This reasoning is flawed because one \"loop\" of a stationary wave (the distance between two consecutive nodes) is equal to half a wavelength (\u03bb/2), not a full wavelength. The correct relationship for the pattern shown is L = (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/4) = 3\u03bb/4.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect. A frequency of 1700 Hz would imply a wavelength of \u03bb = v / f = 340 / 1700 = 0.20 m. This result would stem from a significant misinterpretation of the stationary wave pattern. For instance, if one were to incorrectly assume that the length of the tube accommodates three full wavelengths (L = 3\u03bb), then the wavelength would be \u03bb = L / 3 = 0.60 / 3 = 0.20 m, leading to a frequency of f = 340 / 0.20 = 1700 Hz. The pattern clearly shows less than one full wavelength within the tube, so this assumption is physically incorrect. This value is also exactly double the frequency of option C, suggesting it might arise from compounding conceptual errors, such as misidentifying the length-wavelength relationship and then making a further calculation error by a factor of two."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_147.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 a continuous progressive water wave in a ripple tank passes through a gap in a barrier and\ndiffracts.\nthe width of the gap is greater than the wavelength of the wave.\nwhich change causes the wave to spread over a larger angle as it passes through the gap?\na asmall decrease in the wavelength of the wave\nb  asmall decrease in the width of the gap\nc asmall increase in the frequency of the wave\nd  asmall increase in the height of the barrier", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (B)\n\nThe phenomenon described is diffraction, which is the spreading of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. The extent to which a wave diffracts, or the angle over which it spreads, is determined by the ratio of the wavelength (\u03bb) to the width of the gap (a).\n\nSignificant diffraction occurs when the wavelength is comparable to the size of the gap. The angle of diffraction is proportional to the ratio \u03bb/a. To cause the wave to spread over a larger angle, this ratio must be increased.\n\nDecreasing the width of the gap (a) while keeping the wavelength (\u03bb) constant increases the value of the ratio \u03bb/a. As this ratio increases, the gap width becomes closer in size to the wavelength, leading to more pronounced diffraction. Consequently, the wave spreads out over a larger angle after passing through the gap.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: a small decrease in the wavelength of the wave**\n    This is incorrect. The angle of diffraction is proportional to the ratio \u03bb/a. Decreasing the wavelength (\u03bb) while keeping the gap width (a) constant would decrease this ratio. A smaller \u03bb/a ratio results in less diffraction, meaning the wave would spread over a smaller, not a larger, angle.\n\n*   **C: a small increase in the frequency of the wave**\n    This is incorrect. The speed of a wave (v) in a given medium (like the water in a ripple tank) is constant. The wave speed is related to frequency (f) and wavelength (\u03bb) by the equation v = f\u03bb. If the wave speed v is constant, an increase in frequency (f) must be accompanied by a decrease in wavelength (\u03bb). As explained for option A, a decrease in wavelength leads to a smaller amount of diffraction, not a larger one.\n\n*   **D: a small increase in the height of the barrier**\n    This is incorrect. The height of the barrier is irrelevant to the diffraction of the water wave. Diffraction is concerned with the interaction of the wave with the horizontal dimensions of the gap. The spreading of the wave occurs in the horizontal plane of the water's surface and is determined by the wave's wavelength and the gap's width, not the vertical height of the barrier."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_148.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 the diagram shows a view from above of a double-slit interference demonstration.\nl is a monochromatic light source with a vertical filament. b is a barrier with two narrow vertical\nslits and s is a screen upon which interference fringes form.\nnot to\nscale\n* |\nl\n| b s\nthe intensity is i at the point on the screen where the centre of the fringe pattern forms.\nwhen one of the slits is covered, what is the intensity at the same point on the screen?\ni i i i\na \u2014 b = cc \u2014\u2014 db =\nv2 2 2/2 4", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe intensity of a light wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude (*I* \u221d *A*\u00b2).

It might arise from a mistaken assumption that intensity is directly proportional to amplitude (*I* \u221d *A*), which would mean halving the amplitude halves the intensity. However, the intensity of a wave is proportional to the *square* of its amplitude (*I* \u221d *A*\u00b2). The total amplitude for two slits is 2*A\u2080*, and for one slit is *A\u2080*, a factor of 2 difference. Squaring this factor gives a factor of 4 for the intensity.\n\n#### B: *I*/2\nThis is a common misconception. It incorrectly assumes that the total intensity is simply the sum of the intensities from each slit. If the intensity from one slit is *I*<sub>1</sub>, one might think the total intensity from two slits is 2*I*<sub>1</sub>. This would be true if the light sources were incoherent. However, in a double-slit experiment, the light from the slits is coherent. The principle of superposition applies to the wave *amplitudes*, which are added together *before* being squared to find the resultant intensity. Due to constructive interference, the intensity at the central maximum is four times the intensity from a single slit, not twice. Therefore, removing one slit reduces the intensity by a factor of four, not two.\n\n#### C: *I*/(2\u221a2)\nThis answer is incorrect and does not correspond to a valid physical relationship in this context. It may result from a compounded error in applying the relationship between intensity and amplitude, perhaps by incorrectly combining factors of 2 and \u221a2.

This error typically results from an incorrect algebraic rearrangement of the correct relationship. Starting from the correct formula for the total resistance, R = \u03c1L / (12A), an incorrect inversion might lead to 1/R = 12A / (\u03c1L).

For a lamp to be 'on', there must be a complete circuit allowing current to flow through it.\n\nA diode is a semiconductor component that permits current to flow in one direction only. This direction is indicated by the arrow in its circuit symbol. When current flows in the direction of the arrow, the diode is said to be forward-biased and acts like a closed switch. If current attempts to flow against the arrow, the diode is reverse-biased and acts like an open switch, blocking the current.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the branch with lamp 1:** Current flows from the positive terminal and down through the first parallel branch. The diode in this branch is oriented with its arrow pointing downwards, in the same direction as the current flow. Therefore, this diode is forward-biased and allows current to pass through. The current continues through lamp 1, causing it to light up. Thus, lamp 1 is 'on'.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the branch with lamp 2:** Current also flows down through the second parallel branch. This branch contains two diodes connected in parallel with each other.\n    *   The left diode is oriented with its arrow pointing downwards, in the direction of current flow. It is forward-biased and provides a path for the current.\n    *   The right diode is oriented with its arrow pointing upwards, against the direction of current flow.

For a lamp to be 'off', the path for the current must be broken. In the branch with lamp 1, the diode is forward-biased, allowing current to flow and light the lamp. In the branch with lamp 2, one of the two parallel diodes is forward-biased, which is sufficient to complete the circuit and allow current to flow through lamp 2. Therefore, both lamps will be 'on', not 'off'.\n\n#### B: lamp 1 on, lamp 2 off\n\nThis option is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that lamp 1 is 'on', it incorrectly states that lamp 2 is 'off'. In the branch containing lamp 2, there are two diodes in parallel. Although one diode is reverse-biased and blocks current, the other is forward-biased. In a parallel arrangement, current only needs one valid path to flow. Since the forward-biased diode provides a complete circuit, current flows through lamp 2, causing it to be 'on'.\n\n#### C: lamp 1 off, lamp 2 on\n\nThis option is incorrect because it incorrectly states that lamp 1 is 'off'. The diode in series with lamp 1 is oriented in the direction of conventional current flow (from positive to negative).

Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge (I = \u0394Q/\u0394t). Therefore, the law implies that the rate at which charge flows into a junction must be equal to the rate at which charge flows out. This ensures that charge does not accumulate at or disappear from the junction. This is a direct statement of the principle of conservation of charge, a fundamental law of physics which states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. energy:** The conservation of energy is the principle underlying Kirchhoff's *second* law (the loop rule). This law states that the sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) in any closed loop is equal to the sum of the potential drops across the components in that loop. Since emf is the energy supplied per unit charge and potential drop is the energy dissipated per unit charge, this law is a direct application of the conservation of energy to a closed circuit.\n\n**C. momentum:** The principle of conservation of momentum applies to systems of interacting objects and states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant. While charge carriers like electrons have mass and momentum, Kirchhoff's laws describe the macroscopic behaviour of current and potential difference in a circuit, not the microscopic collisions or momentum exchanges between individual particles. Therefore, conservation of momentum is not the basis for Kirchhoff's first law.\n\n**D. potential difference:** Potential difference is not a conserved quantity. It is a measure of the energy difference per unit charge between two points in an electric field. While Kirchhoff's second law states that the sum of potential differences around a closed loop is zero, this is a consequence of the conservation of energy, not a conservation law for potential difference itself.

Current would only be zero if the net e.m.f. in the circuit was zero. However, the net e.m.f. is E, which drives a current through the circuit.

The total potential drop of E is distributed equally among the three identical resistors, so the drop across one is E/3.\n\n*   **D) E:** A potential difference of E across a single resistor would mean that this one resistor accounts for the entire potential drop supplied by the net e.m.f.

The ammeter reading is zero when the bridge is balanced. This occurs when the ratio of resistances in the two arms of the upper branch is equal to the ratio of resistances in the two arms of the lower branch (the uniform metal wire).\n\nLet the resistance of the fixed resistor be R\u2081, and the resistance of the light-dependent resistor (LDR) be R_LDR. Let the resistance of the uniform wire to the left of the sliding contact be R_left, and to the right be R_right. The initial balanced condition is given by the equation:\n\nR\u2081 / R_LDR = R_left / R_right\n\nWhen the LDR is covered, the amount of light falling on it decreases. The resistance of an LDR is inversely proportional to the intensity of light. Therefore, covering the LDR causes its resistance, R_LDR, to increase.\n\nThis increase in R_LDR disturbs the balance of the bridge. The ratio R\u2081 / R_LDR becomes smaller, so the equality no longer holds:\n\nR\u2081 / R_LDR(new) < R_left / R_right\n\nTo re-balance the bridge and return the ammeter reading to zero, the ratio on the right-hand side, R_left / R_right, must be decreased to match the new, smaller ratio on the left.\n\nThe ratio R_left / R_right is decreased by reducing R_left and increasing R_right. Since the metal wire is uniform, its resistance is proportional to its length. Moving the sliding contact to the left decreases the length of the wire on the left side (decreasing R_left) and simultaneously increases the length of the wire on the right side (increasing R_right). This action successfully decreases the ratio R_left / R_right, allowing the bridge to be re-balanced.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: decreasing the supply voltage**\nThe condition for a balanced Wheatstone bridge (R\u2081/R\u2082 = R\u2083/R\u2084) is dependent only on the resistance values in the four arms. It is independent of the supply voltage. Decreasing the supply voltage would decrease the magnitude of the current flowing through the unbalanced bridge, but it would not change the potential difference between the two points connected by the ammeter to zero. Therefore, it cannot re-balance the bridge.\n\n**B: increasing the supply voltage**\nSimilar to option A, the balance condition of the Wheatstone bridge is independent of the supply voltage. Increasing the supply voltage would increase the potential difference across the bridge and increase the current through the ammeter in the unbalanced state, but it would not bring the current to zero.\n\n**D: moving the sliding contact to the right**\nMoving the sliding contact to the right would have the opposite effect to that required. It would increase the length and thus the resistance of the wire on the left (R_left) and decrease the length and resistance of the wire on the right (R_right). This would increase the ratio R_left / R_right, moving it further away from the new, smaller value of R\u2081 / R_LDR. This would unbalance the bridge even more, increasing the ammeter reading rather than returning it to zero."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_158.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "38 what are isotopes?\na nuclei of different elements with the same number of neutrons\nb nuclei of different elements with the same number of nucleons\nc nuclei of the same element with different numbers of neutrons\nd nuclei of the same element with different numbers of protons", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe identity of a chemical element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus, known as the atomic number (Z). All nuclei of the same element must, by definition, have the same number of protons. Isotopes are different nuclear forms of the same element. This means they share the same atomic number (Z) but have different mass numbers (A). The mass number represents the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus. Since the number of protons is constant for a given element, the variation in mass number among its isotopes must arise from a different number of neutrons. Therefore, isotopes are correctly defined as nuclei of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. nuclei of different elements with the same number of neutrons**\n\nThis statement defines **isotones**, not isotopes. \"Different elements\" implies that the nuclei have different numbers of protons (different atomic numbers). Nuclei that share the same number of neutrons but have different numbers of protons are called isotones.

The number of protons (the atomic number) is the defining characteristic of an element. If a nucleus has a different number of protons, it is, by definition, a different element.

This magnitude is represented by a numerical value. For example, if we measure a length, we might record it as 1.5 metres. Here, \"1.5\" is the numerical value.

The unit for power (*P*) is the watt (W) and the unit for current (*I*) is the ampere (A), so the unit for resistance is W A\u207b\u00b2.

For an object undergoing uniform (constant) acceleration, this is calculated as the change in velocity (\u0394v) divided by the time interval (\u0394t) over which the change occurs.\n\nThe change in velocity is the final velocity (v) minus the initial velocity (u):\n\u0394v = v - u\n\nThe time interval is simply t.\n\nTherefore, the definition of acceleration is:\na = \u0394v / \u0394t = (v - u) / t\n\nTo derive the equation in option C, we can rearrange this definition:\n1.  Multiply both sides by t:\n    at = v - u\n2.  Add u to both sides:\n    at + u = v\n3.  Rewrite in the standard form:\n    v = u + at\n\nThis shows that the equation `v = u + at` is derived directly and solely from the fundamental definition of acceleration.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: s = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2\n\nThis equation cannot be derived using only the definition of acceleration because it involves displacement (s), which is not part of the definition of acceleration (a = \u0394v / \u0394t). The derivation of this equation requires combining two separate principles:\n1.  The relationship between velocity, acceleration, and time (`v = u + at`), which comes from the definition of acceleration.\n2.  The relationship between displacement, velocity, and time. For uniform acceleration, displacement is the product of the average velocity and time: `s = (average velocity) \u00d7 t`. The average velocity is `(u + v) / 2`.\n\nBy substituting `v = u + at` into `s = \u00bd(u + v)t`, we arrive at `s = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2`. Since this requires an additional concept (average velocity), it is not derived *only* from the definition of acceleration.\n\n#### B: s = \u00bd(u + v)t\n\nThis equation defines displacement (s) as the product of the average velocity and time for an object moving with constant acceleration. The average velocity is given by `(u + v) / 2`. Therefore, this equation is derived from the definition of average velocity, not the definition of acceleration. While it is a valid equation for uniformly accelerated motion, its origin is a different physical principle.\n\n#### D: v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as\n\nThis equation is derived by combining other kinematic equations to eliminate the time variable (t). Typically, it is derived by combining `v = u + at` and `s = \u00bd(u + v)t`.\n\n1.  From `v = u + at`, rearrange to make t the subject: `t = (v - u) / a`.\n2.

The relationship between displacement (`s`), initial velocity (`u`), time (`t`), and uniform acceleration (`a`) is given by the equation of motion: `s = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2`.\n\nSince the object starts from rest, its initial vertical velocity (`u`) is zero. Therefore, the equation for vertical displacement (`s_y`) simplifies to `s_y = \u00bdat\u00b2`. This indicates that the vertical displacement is directly proportional to the square of time (`s_y \u221d t\u00b2`).\n\nA graph of displacement versus time for this relationship is a parabola that starts at the origin (since displacement is zero at time zero). The gradient of a displacement-time graph represents velocity. For the equation `s_y = \u00bdat\u00b2`, the gradient is given by the derivative, `ds_y/dt = at`. This means the gradient (velocity) is zero at `t=0` and increases linearly with time. Consequently, the curve must start with a zero gradient (horizontal) and become progressively steeper. Graph D correctly depicts this parabolic relationship with an increasing gradient.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe object's horizontal motion is described as having uniform (constant) velocity. The relationship between horizontal displacement (`s_x`) and time (`t`) for uniform velocity (`v_x`) is `s_x = v_x * t`. This is a linear relationship, which should be represented graphically as a straight line passing through the origin with a constant positive gradient equal to the velocity `v_x`.\n\nGraph A shows a curve where the gradient is continuously decreasing. A decreasing gradient on a displacement-time graph signifies decreasing velocity, or deceleration.

As established for the correct answer D, the object's vertical motion under uniform acceleration from rest is described by `s_y \u221d t\u00b2`.

The horizontal motion is at a uniform velocity, which should be represented by a straight line graph (`s_x \u221d t`).\n\nGraph C is a curve with an increasing gradient.

Such a value could be obtained through a calculation error or a misapplication of the relevant physical principles.

They act on two different objects (one on the Moon, one on the Earth).\n\nTherefore, this diagram correctly illustrates a pair of forces described by Newton's third law.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** The driving force and the total resistive forces are shown acting on the **same object** (the car). A Newton's third law pair of forces must act on two different interacting objects. The situation depicted, where the forces are equal, describes a condition of zero net force, meaning the car is moving at a constant velocity, which is an application of Newton's first law. The reaction force to the driving force is the force the car's wheels exert on the road, not the resistive forces.\n\n**C:** The weight of the block and the support force from the surface both act on the **same object** (the block). Furthermore, they are **different types of forces**: weight is a non-contact gravitational force, while the support force is a contact force. A Newton's third law pair must be of the same type. The reaction force to the block's weight is the gravitational pull of the block on the Earth. The reaction to the support force is the force the block exerts down on the surface.

At this point, the net force on the ball is zero, and it falls at a constant speed.\n\nLet's analyze the forces acting on each ball:\n*   **Weight (W):** Acts downwards, given by W = mg, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the balls have different masses, the heavier ball has a greater weight (W_h > W_l).\n*   **Upthrust (U):** Acts upwards. According to Archimedes' principle, upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Since the balls have identical shape and size, they displace the same volume of liquid. Therefore, the upthrust is the same for both balls.\n*   **Drag Force (D):** Acts upwards, opposing the motion. The drag force increases as the speed of the ball increases.\n\nThe condition for terminal velocity is:\nWeight = Upthrust + Drag Force\nW = U + D\n\nRearranging for the drag force:\nD = W - U\n\nFor the heavier ball: D_h = W_h - U\nFor the lighter ball: D_l = W_l - U\n\nSince W_h > W_l and U is the same for both, it follows that (W_h - U) > (W_l - U).\nTherefore, the drag force on the heavier ball (D_h) must be greater than the drag force on the lighter ball (D_l) for terminal velocity to be reached.\n\nAs the drag force increases with speed, a larger drag force requires a larger speed. Consequently, the heavier ball must be falling at a larger speed than the lighter ball to achieve the necessary drag force to balance its greater weight.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: The heavier ball has a larger acceleration than the lighter ball.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem states that for each ball, the sum of the upward forces (drag and upthrust) equals the downward force (weight). This means the net force on each ball is zero. According to Newton's Second Law (F_net = ma), a zero net force results in zero acceleration. Both balls are moving at a constant velocity (their respective terminal velocities), so their acceleration is zero.\n\n**B: The heavier ball has a smaller deceleration than the lighter ball.**\nThis is incorrect. As explained for option A, the net force on each ball is zero, which means their acceleration is zero. Neither ball is accelerating or decelerating. They are moving at a constant terminal velocity.\n\n**C: The heavier ball is falling at the same speed as the lighter ball.**\nThis is incorrect. For the forces to balance, the total upward force must equal the weight. Since the heavier ball has a greater weight and the upthrust is the same for both, the heavier ball requires a larger drag force to achieve equilibrium.

It may result from a conceptual error confusing momentum and energy. The change in momentum of object X is *\u0394p*\u2093 = *p*_final - *p*_initial = *m*(-\u00b3\u1d5b\u2044\u2085) - *m*(*v*) = -\u2078\u2044\u2085*mv*. By conservation of momentum, the final momentum of Y is *p*_Y,final = \u2078\u2044\u2085*mv*. If one were to incorrectly calculate the kinetic energy of Y using the formula KE = \u00bd * *p* *v*, substituting the initial velocity of X (*v*) instead of the final velocity of Y, it would lead to KE = \u00bd * (\u2078\u2044\u2085*mv*) * *v* = \u2078\u2044\u2081\u2080*mv*\u00b2.

It arises from a misunderstanding of the principle of conservation of energy. This result is obtained by incorrectly adding the total initial kinetic energy (\u00b2\u2075\u2044\u2085\u2080*mv*\u00b2) and the final kinetic energy of object X (\u2079\u2044\u2085\u2080*mv*\u00b2).

For two forces to constitute a couple, they must be separated by a perpendicular distance. If the two forces were to act through the same point, their lines of action would be identical. As they are also equal and opposite, they would cancel each other out completely, resulting in zero net force and zero net torque. Consequently, there would be no effect on the object's state of motion. Therefore, it is a requirement that the forces act along different, parallel lines of action, not through the same point.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nA fundamental requirement for a pair of forces to form a couple is that they must act in opposite directions. This condition, along with the requirement that the forces have equal magnitude, ensures that the resultant linear force on the object is zero. If the forces acted in the same direction, they would produce a net force, causing the object to accelerate linearly, which contradicts the definition of a couple that produces pure rotation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nA key characteristic of a couple is that it produces a pure turning moment (torque) without causing any translational motion. For an object's translational motion not to change, the net or resultant force acting on it must be zero, according to Newton's first and second laws. A couple consists of two forces of equal magnitude acting in opposite directions. The vector sum of these two forces is inherently zero. Therefore, producing a zero resultant force is a defining requirement for a couple.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nFor two forces to act as a couple, they must have equal magnitude. If the magnitudes of the two opposing forces were unequal, there would be a non-zero resultant force acting on the object. This net force would cause the object to undergo linear acceleration (translation). By definition, a couple creates only a turning effect (torque) and does not cause any change in the linear motion of the object's center of mass.

This value does not correspond to a common conceptual error in applying the principle of moments and is likely the result of a miscalculation. To find the correct mass, the clockwise moment created by the rule's weight must balance the anticlockwise moment created by the hanging mass.

The correct calculation, `M = (64 \u00d7 30.0) / 16.0`, yields 120 g.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis answer is incorrect. It likely arises from using the wrong distance for the anticlockwise moment.

For instance, multiplying the density of water by the volume of alcohol and vice versa: ((1000 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 0.50 m\u00b3) + (800 kg m\u207b\u00b3 \u00d7 1.5 m\u00b3)) / 2.0 m\u00b3 = (500 + 1200) / 2.0 = 850 kg m\u207b\u00b3.

This method is only correct if the volumes of the two substances being mixed are equal. In this case, the volume of water (1.5 m\u00b3) is three times the volume of alcohol (0.50 m\u00b3). Therefore, the final density must be a weighted average, which will be closer to the density of water than to the density of alcohol.\n\n#### C: 940 kg m\u207b\u00b3\nThis value is incorrect and likely the result of a calculation error. The correct calculation for the total mass is 1500 kg + 400 kg = 1900 kg. Dividing this by the total volume of 2.0 m\u00b3 gives 950 kg m\u207b\u00b3.

The principle dictates that the upthrust (or buoyant force) exerted on a body partially or fully immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. In the problem, F_U is defined as the upthrust on the object, and W_L is defined as the weight of the liquid displaced by the object. Therefore, the equation F_U = W_L is a direct statement of this fundamental physical law and must be correct, regardless of the object's motion.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) F_U = W_O - W_L**\n\nThis equation is incorrect. For the object to fall at a constant speed, it must be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, meaning the net force acting on it is zero. The forces acting downwards are the weight of the object (W_O). The forces acting upwards are the upthrust (F_U) and the viscous drag force (let's call it F_D). Therefore, the force balance equation is:\n\nW_O = F_U + F_D\n\nRearranging the equation in option B gives W_O = F_U + W_L. Comparing this with the correct force balance equation implies that W_L = F_D. There is no physical principle that states the weight of the displaced liquid must equal the viscous drag force. The viscous drag depends on the object's speed and shape and the liquid's viscosity, while the weight of the displaced liquid depends on the object's volume and the liquid's density. Thus, this equation is not generally correct.\n\n**C) F_U = W_O**\n\nThis equation implies that the upthrust is equal to the weight of the object. If this were true, the object would be neutrally buoyant. For an object to fall through a liquid, its density must be greater than the liquid's density, which means its weight (W_O) must be greater than the upthrust (F_U). Furthermore, if F_U were equal to W_O, the net force equation (W_O = F_U + F_D) would become W_O = W_O + F_D, which simplifies to F_D = 0. A viscous drag force of zero is impossible for an object moving through a viscous liquid. Therefore, this equation is incorrect.\n\n**D) F_U = W_O + W_L**\n\nThis equation is physically incorrect. It suggests that the upthrust (F_U) is greater than the weight of the object (W_O). If the upthrust alone were greater than the object's weight, the object would experience a net upward force and accelerate upwards, not fall. The object is described as falling, so the downward force (W_O) must be greater than the upward upthrust force (F_U).

This can result in a change in its kinetic energy (KE) and/or its gravitational potential energy (GPE). The question asks to compare the work done during different movements. In cases where an external force (from a machine like a lift or conveyor) acts on the suitcase, the work done by that force is equal to the change in the total mechanical energy of the suitcase (Work done = \u0394KE + \u0394GPE).\n\nIn option **C**, the suitcase is moved vertically upwards by 10 m at a constant speed.\n*   **Change in Kinetic Energy (\u0394KE):** Since the speed is constant, the kinetic energy does not change, so \u0394KE = 0.\n*   **Change in Gravitational Potential Energy (\u0394GPE):** The suitcase is lifted through a vertical height (h) of 10 m. The gain in GPE is given by the formula \u0394GPE = mgh, where 'm' is the mass of the suitcase and 'g' is the acceleration of free fall. Thus, \u0394GPE = mg(10).\n*   **Work Done:** The work done by the lift must account for this change in energy. W = \u0394KE + \u0394GPE = 0 + 10mg = 10mg. This represents a significant energy input from the system to the suitcase.\n\nComparing this with the other options, 10mg is the largest work input by the mechanical system.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: moving the suitcase a distance of 8 m at a constant speed up the sloping conveyor belt**\n\n*   The suitcase moves at a constant speed, so the change in its kinetic energy is zero (\u0394KE = 0).\n*   The work done by the conveyor belt increases the suitcase's gravitational potential energy. The work done is W = \u0394GPE = mgh, where 'h' is the vertical height gained.\n*   The suitcase travels 8 m along the slope, which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. The vertical height 'h' is one of the other sides and must be less than the hypotenuse (h < 8 m).\n*   Therefore, the work done is W = mgh < 8mg. This is less than the 10mg of work done in option C.\n\n**B: moving the suitcase a distance of 16 m at a constant speed along the horizontal conveyor belt**\n\n*   The suitcase moves at a constant speed, so \u0394KE = 0.\n*   The motion is horizontal, meaning there is no change in vertical height, so the change in gravitational potential energy is also zero (\u0394GPE = 0).\n*   The problem states that resistive forces are negligible. To maintain a constant velocity with no opposing forces, no driving force is needed.\n*   Therefore, the work done by the conveyor belt on the suitcase is zero. This is clearly less than the work done in option C.\n\n**D: moving the suitcase a distance of 12 m at increasing speed downwards on the slide**\n\n*   In this case, the suitcase moves down a frictionless slide. The slide is a passive component; it guides the motion but does not perform work on the suitcase because the normal force it provides is always perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n*   The work is done by the conservative force of gravity, which converts the suitcase's stored GPE into KE. The system is not inputting energy; rather, the suitcase's own potential energy is being transformed.\n*   The work done *by the active mechanical system* is zero.\n*   It is important to distinguish this from the *net work done*. The net work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy (W_net = \u0394KE). As the suitcase's speed increases, its KE increases, so the net work done is positive. This positive net work is a result of the conversion from GPE, not an input from the machinery.

The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the flight, as no horizontal forces are acting on the object. The vertical velocity changes due to the constant downward acceleration of gravity.\n\nAt the maximum height of its trajectory, the object's vertical velocity (v\u1d67) is momentarily zero. However, its horizontal velocity (v\u2093) is unchanged. Therefore, the total velocity of the object at this point is equal to its constant horizontal velocity.\n\nThe horizontal velocity can be calculated from the total horizontal distance (range) and the total time of flight:\nv\u2093 = horizontal distance / total time\nv\u2093 = 18 m / 1.5 s = 12 m/s\n\nNow, the kinetic energy at the maximum height can be calculated using this velocity:\nKE = \u00bdmv\u2093\u00b2\nKE = \u00bd \u00d7 0.40 kg \u00d7 (12 m/s)\u00b2\nKE = 0.20 kg \u00d7 144 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\nKE = 28.8 J\n\nThis value, when rounded to two significant figures, is 29 J.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nA kinetic energy of 0 J would mean that the object's velocity is zero, implying it has come to a complete stop. For a projectile, at the highest point of its path, only the vertical component of its velocity is momentarily zero. The horizontal component of its velocity remains constant and non-zero throughout the entire flight (as air resistance is ignored). Because the object is still moving horizontally, it possesses kinetic energy. Therefore, the kinetic energy at the maximum height cannot be zero.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis answer is incorrect as it results from a miscalculation of the object's velocity at its maximum height. The kinetic energy at the peak of the trajectory depends solely on the constant horizontal component of velocity. An answer of 2.4 J might arise from incorrectly using a different velocity value, such as an average vertical velocity over part of the trajectory, rather than the true horizontal velocity. The correct method is to first calculate the constant horizontal velocity from the total range and flight time and then use this value in the kinetic energy formula.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis value corresponds to the object's gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh) at its maximum height, not its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, while potential energy is the energy stored due to an object's position in a gravitational field.\n\nTo find the potential energy at the maximum height, one would first calculate the time to reach the peak (half the total time, 0.75 s), then the initial vertical velocity, and finally the maximum height itself (approximately 2.76 m). Calculating PE = mgh would yield approximately 11 J.

The source appears at its brightest, which means the maximum possible light is being transmitted. This occurs when the transmission axes of both filters are aligned with each other and with the plane of polarisation of the source light. Let's define this initial alignment as an angle of 0\u00b0.\n\n**Rotation Analysis:**\nOne filter is rotated anticlockwise by an angle \u03b8, and the other is rotated clockwise by the same angle \u03b8.\n*   The first filter's transmission axis is now at an angle of +\u03b8 relative to the source's polarisation plane.\n*   The second filter's transmission axis is now at an angle of -\u03b8 relative to the source's polarisation plane.\n\nThe intensity of light after the first filter (I\u2081) is given by I\u2081 = I_source * cos\u00b2(\u03b8).\nThe light emerging from the first filter is now polarised at an angle of +\u03b8. This light then passes through the second filter, whose axis is at -\u03b8. The angle between the light's new polarisation plane (+\u03b8) and the second filter's axis (-\u03b8) is |(+\u03b8) - (-\u03b8)| = 2\u03b8.\nThe final intensity (I_final) seen by the observer is I_final = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(2\u03b8) = [I_source * cos\u00b2(\u03b8)] * cos\u00b2(2\u03b8).\n\n**Case 1: Rotation of 90\u00b0 (\u03b8 = 90\u00b0)**\n*   The first filter is rotated by 90\u00b0. The angle between its axis and the source polarisation is 90\u00b0.\n*   According to Malus's Law, the intensity after the first filter is I\u2081 = I_source * cos\u00b2(90\u00b0).\n*   Since cos(90\u00b0) = 0, I\u2081 = 0.\n*   No light passes through the first filter. Consequently, the final intensity reaching the observer is zero, and the source appears at its **darkest**.\n\n**Case 2: Rotation of 180\u00b0 (\u03b8 = 180\u00b0)**\n*   The first filter is rotated by 180\u00b0. The angle between its axis and the source polarisation is 180\u00b0.\n*   The intensity after the first filter is I\u2081 = I_source * cos\u00b2(180\u00b0). Since cos(180\u00b0) = -1, I\u2081 = I_source * (-1)\u00b2 = I_source. All the light passes through the first filter.\n*   The light emerging from the first filter is polarised at 180\u00b0.\n*   The second filter is rotated by -180\u00b0. The angle between the light from the first filter (180\u00b0) and the axis of the second filter (-180\u00b0) is |180\u00b0 - (-180\u00b0)| = 360\u00b0. An angle of 360\u00b0 is equivalent to 0\u00b0, meaning the axes are parallel.\n*   The final intensity is I_final = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(360\u00b0) = I_source * (1)\u00b2 = I_source.\n*   This is the maximum possible intensity, equal to the initial brightness. The source appears at its **brightest**.\n\nTherefore, the source appears darkest for a 90\u00b0 rotation and brightest for a 180\u00b0 rotation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: brightest, brightest**\nThis is incorrect for the 90\u00b0 rotation. When the first filter is rotated by 90\u00b0 from its initial position, its transmission axis becomes perpendicular to the plane of polarisation of the incident light. As a result, it blocks all the light (I\u2081 = I_source * cos\u00b2(90\u00b0) = 0), leading to a darkest appearance, not brightest.\n\n**B: brightest, darkest**\nThis is incorrect for both rotations. As explained for option A, a 90\u00b0 rotation results in the darkest appearance. For the 180\u00b0 rotation, rotating each filter by 180\u00b0 (one clockwise, one anticlockwise) results in both filters being realigned with the initial source polarisation (an angle of 180\u00b0 is functionally parallel to 0\u00b0 for transmission). This configuration allows for maximum light transmission, making the source appear brightest, not darkest.\n\n**D: darkest, darkest**\nThis is incorrect for the 180\u00b0 rotation. While the 90\u00b0 rotation correctly results in a darkest appearance, the 180\u00b0 rotation does not. A rotation of 180\u00b0 for the first filter aligns its axis parallel to the source polarisation, resulting in maximum transmission (I\u2081 = I_source * cos\u00b2(180\u00b0) = I_source). The second filter's axis is also parallel to the light emerging from the first. Therefore, the final intensity is maximal, and the source appears brightest, not darkest."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_185.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 the diagram shows a string stretched between fixed points x and y. there is a stationary wave\n\non the string.\n\nis)\n\u201cnn i\ncn 7 sx\n/ \\ 7 \\\n/ \\ / \\\n/ \\ f \\\nx\u00a2-----e----- oa ro. \u2014----------py\n' rp ff \\ /\n\\ / \\ /\n\\ / \\ /\nno 7 \\.\n~~ s ~s\nt\n\nthe solid curve shows the string at a position of maximum displacement at time fo. the dashed\n\ncurve shows the other position of maximum displacement. the straight central dashed line shows\n\nthe mean position of the string.\n\npoint s on the string is directly above point p. point t on the string is directly below point q.\n\nwhich statement is correct?\n\na asshort time after f, point r on the string will be displaced.\n\nb_ ashort time after fo, points s and t on the string move in opposite directions.\n\nc_ the distance between p and q is one wavelength.\n\nd two moving points on the string that are equal distances from point r vibrate in phase.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (B)\n\nIn a stationary wave, all points within a single segment (or loop, the region between two adjacent nodes) oscillate in phase.

Point S is at a maximum positive displacement, and point T is at a maximum negative displacement. A short time after t\u2080, all points on the string will begin to move towards the equilibrium position. Since point S is at its positive peak, it will start to move downwards (in the negative direction). Conversely, point T is at its negative trough and will start to move upwards (in the positive direction). Therefore, points S and T move in opposite directions.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: A short time after t\u2080, point R on the string will be displaced.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In a stationary wave, certain points remain permanently at rest at the equilibrium position. These points are called nodes.

In a stationary wave, the distance between two consecutive nodes or two consecutive antinodes is equal to half a wavelength (\u03bb/2). Point P is horizontally aligned with the antinode S, and point Q is horizontally aligned with the antinode T. Since S and T are adjacent antinodes, the horizontal distance between them, which is the distance between P and Q, is half a wavelength (\u03bb/2), not a full wavelength (\u03bb). A full wavelength would be the distance covering two complete segments (e.g., from X to R).\n\n**D: Two moving points on the string that are equal distances from point R vibrate in phase.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Point R is a node. A node acts as a point of phase reversal. Any two points on opposite sides of a node vibrate in antiphase (180\u00b0 out of phase). Therefore, two moving points on the string that are equidistant from the node R will be in adjacent segments.

The distance between two consecutive nodes is equal to half a wavelength (\u03bb/2).\n\nFrom the graph, the intensity is zero at distances x = 5.0 cm and x = 15.0 cm. These are the positions of two consecutive nodes.

For example, if the wavelength was incorrectly assumed to be approximately 0.15 m (the position of the second node shown), the frequency would be calculated as f = 340 / 0.15 \u2248 2267 Hz. This is incorrect because the x-axis value of 15.0 cm represents a position, not a wavelength.\n\n**C: 3400 Hz**\nThis result is obtained if the distance between two consecutive nodes (10.0 cm) is mistaken for the full wavelength (\u03bb), instead of half a wavelength (\u03bb/2). If \u03bb were incorrectly taken as 10.0 cm (0.10 m), the frequency calculation would be f = v / \u03bb = 340 / 0.10 = 3400 Hz. The distance between consecutive nodes in a stationary wave is always \u03bb/2.\n\n**D: 6800 Hz**\nThis result arises from misinterpreting the distance between a node and an adjacent antinode as the full wavelength.

If this distance were mistaken for the full wavelength (\u03bb = 5.0 cm = 0.05 m), the frequency would be calculated as f = v / \u03bb = 340 / 0.05 = 6800 Hz.

The amount or degree of diffraction is determined by the ratio of the wavelength of the wave (\u03bb) to the width of the gap (w). For a noticeable effect, the wavelength should be comparable to the gap width.\n\nTo maintain the same amount of diffraction, the ratio \u03bb/w must remain constant.\n\nLet the initial wavelength be \u03bb\u2081 and the initial gap width be w\u2081. The initial ratio is \u03bb\u2081/w\u2081.\nIn this case, w\u2081 = *w*.\n\nThe wavelength is then doubled, so the new wavelength is \u03bb\u2082 = 2\u03bb\u2081.\nLet the new gap width required to produce the same amount of diffraction be w\u2082. The new ratio is \u03bb\u2082/w\u2082.\n\nFor the amount of diffraction to be the same, the ratios must be equal:\n\u03bb\u2081 / w\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / w\u2082\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\u03bb\u2081 / *w* = 2\u03bb\u2081 / w\u2082\n\nTo solve for w\u2082, we can rearrange the equation:\nw\u2082 = (2\u03bb\u2081 * *w*) / \u03bb\u2081\nw\u2082 = 2*w*\n\nTherefore, to cause the same amount of diffraction when the wavelength is doubled, the gap width must also be doubled to 2*w*.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 0.5*w*\nThis is incorrect. If the new gap width were 0.5*w*, the new ratio of wavelength to gap width would be (2\u03bb\u2081) / (0.5*w*) = 4(\u03bb\u2081/w\u2081). This new ratio is four times the original ratio. A larger ratio of \u03bb/w results in *more* diffraction, not the same amount.\n\n#### B: *w*\nThis is incorrect. If the gap width remained unchanged at *w* while the wavelength doubled to 2\u03bb\u2081, the new ratio would be (2\u03bb\u2081)/w\u2081 = 2(\u03bb\u2081/w\u2081). This ratio is twice the original. This would lead to a *greater* amount of diffraction, as the waves would spread out more significantly.\n\n#### D: 4*w*\nThis is incorrect. If the new gap width were 4*w*, the new ratio of wavelength to gap width would be (2\u03bb\u2081) / (4*w*) = 0.5(\u03bb\u2081/w\u2081). This new ratio is half of the original ratio.

It likely arises from two consecutive errors: first, using the small-angle approximation (`sin(\u03b8) \u2248 tan(\u03b8)`) which is invalid for large angles, and second, failing to double the result to find the total distance between the two maxima. The calculation would be `y = L tan(\u03b8) \u2248 L sin(\u03b8) = 1.50 m \u00d7 0.90 = 1.35 m`, which is close to 1.4 m.

This approximation is only valid for very small angles (typically less than 10\u00b0). In this problem, `sin(\u03b8) = 0.90`, which corresponds to a large angle (`\u03b8 \u2248 64\u00b0`), so the approximation is not valid.

These free electrons are not bound to any single atom and are able to move throughout the material.\n\nWhen a cell is connected, it establishes a potential difference across the wire, creating an electric field. The negative terminal of the cell has a high concentration of electrons and is at a lower electric potential, while the positive terminal has a deficit of electrons and is at a higher electric potential.\n\nElectrons are fundamental particles with a negative charge. Due to the electrostatic force exerted by the electric field, these negatively charged free electrons are repelled by the negative terminal and attracted towards the positive terminal. This directional movement of electrons from the negative to the positive terminal constitutes the electric current in the wire.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: Negatively charged nuclei in the wire move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two primary reasons. Firstly, atomic nuclei, containing positively charged protons, are themselves positively charged. Secondly, in a solid metal, the nuclei are fixed in a rigid lattice structure and are not free to move. They vibrate about their fixed positions but do not travel through the wire to carry charge.\n\n**C: Positively charged electrons in the wire move from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect because electrons are, by definition, negatively charged particles.

For resistors in a parallel arrangement, the potential difference (voltage) across each resistor is the same. In this case, since the battery has negligible internal resistance, the potential difference across each resistor is equal to the battery's e.m.f., which is 12 V.\n\nThe formula for power (P) dissipated by a resistor of resistance (R) with a potential difference (V) across it is given by:\nP = V\u00b2/R\n\nLet P_R be the power dissipated by the resistor R, and P_2R be the power dissipated by the resistor 2R.\n\nP_R = V\u00b2 / R = (12 V)\u00b2 / R = 144 / R\nP_2R = V\u00b2 / (2R) = (12 V)\u00b2 / (2R) = 144 / (2R) = 72 / R\n\nThe total power dissipated (P_total) is the sum of the individual powers:\nP_total = P_R + P_2R\n36 W = (144 / R) + (72 / R)\n\nCombining the terms on the right side:\n36 = (144 + 72) / R\n36 = 216 / R\n\nTo find the value of R, we rearrange the equation:\nR = 216 / 36\nR = 6.0 \u03a9\n\nThus, the value of the resistance R is 6.0 \u03a9.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 0.50 \u03a9**\nThis answer would be obtained if the formula for power was incorrectly recalled as P = V/R_eq, where R_eq is the equivalent resistance. Following this incorrect formula, one would calculate R_eq = V/P_total = 12 V / 36 W = 1/3 \u03a9. The correct formula for the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is 1/R_eq = 1/R + 1/(2R), which simplifies to R_eq = 2R/3. Equating the incorrect R_eq with the correct expression (2R/3 = 1/3) would lead to 2R = 1, and therefore R = 0.5 \u03a9. The fundamental error is using an incorrect power formula.\n\n**B: 2.7 \u03a9**\nThis value does not result from a standard application of the relevant physics principles or a common conceptual mistake. The correct calculation, based on summing the powers of the individual parallel resistors (P_total = V\u00b2/R + V\u00b2/(2R)), leads to R = 6.0 \u03a9. Obtaining 2.7 \u03a9 would require a significant calculation error or the use of an incorrect formula that does not represent a typical misunderstanding of the physics involved.\n\n**C: 4.0 \u03a9**\nThis answer arises from the misconception that the total power dissipated in the circuit (36 W) is dissipated by only one of the resistors, specifically the resistor with resistance R. If one incorrectly assumes P_total = P_R, then using the power formula P = V\u00b2/R, the calculation would be 36 W = (12 V)\u00b2 / R. This gives R = 144 / 36 = 4.0 \u03a9.

The correct calculation, based on Ohm's Law (R = V/I) and the resistance formula (R = \u03c1L/A), yields a cross-sectional area of approximately 1.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m\u00b2. Obtaining a value of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m\u00b2 would require a miscalculation, such as an error in arithmetic or incorrectly transcribing one of the given values during the calculation process.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option, 1.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2, has an incorrect order of magnitude.

For the most common type of thermistor (NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient), its resistance decreases as the temperature increases.\n\n1.  **Circuit Analysis:** The circuit consists of a cell (providing a constant voltage, V), a thermistor (resistance R_th), and a fixed resistor (resistance R_fixed) connected in series. The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the individual resistances: R_total = R_th + R_fixed.\n2.  **Effect of Temperature:** The problem states that the temperature (T) of the thermistor is increased. As T increases, the resistance of the thermistor (R_th) decreases.\n3.  **Total Resistance Change:** Since R_fixed is constant, a decrease in R_th leads to a decrease in the total circuit resistance, R_total.\n4.  **Current Change (Ohm's Law):** According to Ohm's law, the current (I) in the circuit is given by I = V / R_total. As V is constant and R_total decreases, the current I must increase.\n5.  **Non-Linear Relationship:** The relationship between a thermistor's resistance and temperature is non-linear (typically exponential).

This always results in a decrease in the total equivalent resistance of the external circuit.\n\n2.  **Effect on Total Current (Ammeter Reading):** The total resistance of the entire circuit is the sum of the external resistance and the constant internal resistance of the battery. Since the external resistance decreases, the total circuit resistance also decreases. According to Ohm's law for the whole circuit, the total current (I) is given by I = E / (R_ext + r), where E is the constant electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the battery, R_ext is the external resistance, and r is the internal resistance. As the total resistance (R_ext + r) decreases, the total current (I) drawn from the battery must increase. Therefore, the ammeter reading increases.\n\n3.  **Effect on Terminal Potential Difference (Voltmeter Reading):** The voltmeter measures the terminal potential difference (V) across the battery's terminals. This is the e.m.f. minus the potential difference lost across the internal resistance, often called \"lost volts\". The equation is V = E - Ir. Since the total current (I) increases and both E and r are constant, the term Ir (the lost volts) increases. Consequently, the terminal potential difference (V) must decrease.\n\nIn summary, closing the switch causes the ammeter reading to increase and the voltmeter reading to decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because the ammeter reading increases, not decreases. Closing the switch adds a parallel path for the current, which lowers the total external resistance of the circuit. A lower total circuit resistance leads to a higher total current flowing from the battery, as given by I = E / R_total.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because the voltmeter reading decreases, not increases. The voltmeter measures the terminal potential difference, V = E - Ir. When the switch is closed, the total current (I) from the battery increases. This leads to a larger potential drop across the internal resistance (Ir), known as \"lost volts\". As the lost volts increase, the terminal potential difference available to the external circuit must decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the voltmeter reading decreases, not increases, because the increased current causes a greater potential drop across the internal resistance (\"lost volts\").

This law states that the sum of the electromotive forces (e.m.f.s) around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to the sum of the potential drops around that loop.

In an atomic nucleus that is neutron-rich, \u03b2\u207b decay can occur to increase stability. The process involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton via the weak nuclear force.\n\nTo conserve fundamental quantities, other particles must be created and emitted:\n1.  **Charge Conservation:** A neutron has a charge of 0, while a proton has a charge of +1. To balance the charge, a particle with a charge of -1 must be emitted. This particle is the electron (e\u207b), which is the \u03b2\u207b particle itself.\n2.  **Lepton Number Conservation:** Electrons are leptons, with a lepton number of +1. Neutrons and protons are baryons and have a lepton number of 0. Before the decay, the total lepton number is 0. After the decay, the emitted electron contributes +1 to the lepton number. To conserve this number (i.e., keep the total at 0), an antiparticle with a lepton number of -1 must also be emitted. This particle is the electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0305\u2091).\n\nThe overall decay equation at the nucleon level is:\nn \u2192 p\u207a + e\u207b + \u03bd\u0305\u2091\n\nTherefore, a neutron changes to a proton, and an electron and an electron antineutrino are emitted.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: A neutron changes to a proton in the nucleus and an electron and a neutrino are emitted.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it violates the law of conservation of lepton number. While it correctly identifies the neutron-to-proton transformation and the emission of an electron, it incorrectly states that a neutrino is emitted. An electron has a lepton number of +1, and a neutrino also has a lepton number of +1. If both were emitted, the total lepton number of the products would be +2. Since the initial lepton number (of the neutron) was 0, this process is forbidden. An electron antineutrino (lepton number -1) must be emitted to conserve the total lepton number at 0.\n\n**C: A proton changes to a neutron in the nucleus and an electron and an antineutrino are emitted.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because \u03b2\u207b decay involves a neutron changing into a proton, not the other way around. The process where a proton changes into a neutron occurs in different types of decay, such as positron emission (\u03b2\u207a decay) or electron capture. Furthermore, the emission of an electron is inconsistent with a proton-to-neutron conversion, as this would violate the conservation of electric charge (+1 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1).\n\n**D: A proton changes to a neutron in the nucleus and an electron and a neutrino are emitted.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. Firstly, as with option C, \u03b2\u207b decay involves a neutron-to-proton conversion, not a proton-to-neutron conversion. Secondly, the proposed decay process violates the law of conservation of electric charge. A proton has a charge of +1. A neutron (charge 0) and an electron (charge -1) would have a combined charge of -1. The process +1 \u2192 -1 is not possible.

Since the mass (m) of the golf ball is constant, its acceleration (a) is directly proportional to the net force (F) acting on it. Therefore, the acceleration-time graph has the same shape as the given force-time graph.\n2.  **Acceleration and Velocity:** Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity (a = dv/dt). This means that the gradient (or slope) of a velocity-time (v-t) graph represents the acceleration.\n3.  **Analyzing the Graph:**\n    *   **First Half of the Interaction:** The F-t graph shows the force increasing linearly from zero to a maximum value. Consequently, the acceleration also increases linearly from zero. This means the gradient of the v-t graph must start at zero and continuously increase, causing the velocity curve to become steeper.\n    *   **Second Half of the Interaction:** The force decreases linearly from its maximum value back to zero. Consequently, the acceleration also decreases linearly back to zero. It is important to note that the force, and therefore the acceleration, is still positive, so the velocity continues to increase, but at a decreasing rate. This means the gradient of the v-t graph, having reached its maximum value at the midpoint, now starts to decrease, causing the velocity curve to become less steep and eventually horizontal as the force and acceleration return to zero.\n\nThe combination of an initially increasing gradient followed by a decreasing gradient results in the characteristic S-shaped curve shown in graph B. The ball's velocity is zero at the start, increases most rapidly at the midpoint (where the force is maximum), and settles at a constant maximum velocity when the force returns to zero.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**Option A is incorrect.** This graph shows a velocity curve where the gradient is continuously increasing. A continuously increasing gradient implies that the acceleration is always increasing. This only matches the first half of the interaction shown in the force-time graph. It fails to represent the second half, where the force and therefore the acceleration are decreasing.\n\n**Option C is incorrect.** This graph depicts a period of constant, non-zero velocity, which implies zero acceleration (F=0), followed by a sudden change. The given F-t graph shows that the force is continuously changing throughout the interaction, not zero. A constant velocity would only occur if there were no net force.\n\n**Option D is incorrect.** This graph shows a period of linearly increasing velocity followed by a period of linearly decreasing velocity. A linearly changing velocity corresponds to a constant acceleration (a = \u0394v/\u0394t). This would require the force to be a constant positive value for the first half and a constant negative value for the second half.

Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion; this means it resists acceleration when a net force is applied.

However, this is not the fundamental definition of mass. Mass is a primary property (inertia), while momentum is a derived quantity defined in terms of mass.\n*   The definition of weight as \"the work done in lifting it one metre\" is incorrect.

Sphere X rebounds with a speed that is less than u, and sphere Y moves off with a speed that is also less than u.**\n\nThis scenario describes an elastic collision between a lighter object (sphere X) and a heavier, stationary object (sphere Y). The outcome is governed by two fundamental principles: the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the isolated system before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n2.  **Conservation of Kinetic Energy:** Since the collision is elastic, the total kinetic energy of the system is also conserved.\n\nLet's analyze the motion of each sphere:\n\n*   **Sphere X:** When a lighter object strikes a heavier stationary object elastically, the lighter object rebounds. Imagine a tennis ball hitting a stationary bowling ball. The tennis ball (X) will bounce back. In this process, sphere X transfers some of its initial momentum and kinetic energy to sphere Y. As the initial kinetic energy of the system (`1/2 * m_X * u^2`) is now shared between the two spheres, the final kinetic energy of sphere X must be less than its initial kinetic energy. This means its final speed must be less than its initial speed `u`.\n\n*   **Sphere Y:** To conserve momentum, sphere Y must move forward in the original direction of sphere X's motion. It gains kinetic energy from sphere X. However, because `m_Y > m_X`, the velocity imparted to Y is limited. A full analysis of the conservation equations shows that the final speed of sphere Y will also be less than the initial speed `u` of sphere X.\n\nTherefore, sphere X rebounds with a speed less than `u`, and sphere Y moves forward with a speed less than `u`.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Sphere X rebounds with a speed that is greater than u, and sphere Y moves off with a speed that is less than u.**\n\nThis statement violates the principle of conservation of energy. The total kinetic energy of the system before the collision is `1/2 * m_X * u^2`. If sphere X were to rebound with a speed greater than `u`, its final kinetic energy alone would be greater than the total initial kinetic energy of the system. Since sphere Y also moves and thus possesses kinetic energy, the total final kinetic energy would be significantly larger than the initial kinetic energy. This is impossible, as energy cannot be created in a collision.\n\n**C. Sphere X rebounds with speed u, and sphere Y remains stationary.**\n\nThis statement violates the principle of conservation ofmomentum. If sphere Y remains stationary, it has gained zero momentum from the collision. For the total momentum of the system to be conserved, the momentum of sphere X must also be conserved. However, if sphere X rebounds, its velocity changes from `+u` to `-u`, and its momentum changes from `m_X * u` to `-m_X * u`. This change in momentum of sphere X must be balanced by an equal and opposite change in momentum of sphere Y. Since sphere Y is stated to be stationary, this is a contradiction. Therefore, sphere Y must move.\n\n**D. Sphere X remains stationary, and sphere Y moves off with a speed that is less than u.**\n\nThis outcome occurs only under a very specific condition in a one-dimensional elastic collision: when the two colliding masses are exactly equal (`m_X = m_Y`). In that specific case, the first object stops completely, and the second object moves off with the initial velocity of the first. However, the problem explicitly states that the mass of Y is greater than the mass of X (`m_Y > m_X`). Therefore, sphere X cannot come to a stop; it must rebound."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_213.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13 a ball of mass 0.10kg is thrown towards a stationary vertical bat. the ball hits the bat with a\nhorizontal velocity of 20ms\"\".\n20ms\" bat\nooo\nea\nthe ball rebounds and leaves the bat with a horizontal velocity of 145ms\u2122.\nwhat is the change in momentum of the ball?\na 0.20ns b 0.50ns c 1.5ns d 3.5ns", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe change in momentum (\u0394p) of an object is calculated as the difference between its final momentum (p_f) and its initial momentum (p_i).

The correct calculation requires using the full change in velocity, including the change in direction.\n\n#### B: 0.50 Ns\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly treating velocity as a scalar quantity (speed) and simply finding the difference between the initial and final speeds before calculating the change in momentum.

This means there is no net force, and the object will not undergo linear acceleration (\u03a3**F** = 0).\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The sum of the torques (or moments) about any pivot point must be zero. This means there is no net torque, and the object will not undergo angular acceleration (\u03a3\u03c4 = 0).\n\nIn diagram A, two forces of equal magnitude act on the object. One force is directed upwards, and the other is directed downwards. Since they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their vector sum is zero (\u03a3**F** = 0). This satisfies the condition for translational equilibrium.\n\nFurthermore, the two forces are collinear, meaning they act along the same straight line. The torque produced by a force is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force (\u03c4 = Fd). Since both forces lie on the same line of action, the perpendicular distance from any chosen pivot point to this line is the same for both. As the forces are in opposite directions, they create equal and opposite torques, which cancel each other out. Therefore, the net torque is zero (\u03a3\u03c4 = 0), satisfying the condition for rotational equilibrium. Since both conditions are met, the object in diagram A is in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nThe two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so the net force on the object is zero (\u03a3**F** = 0). This means the object is in translational equilibrium. However, the forces are not collinear; their lines of action are parallel but separated by a distance. This pair of forces is known as a couple. A couple produces a net torque that causes rotation. Taking the center of the object as the pivot, both forces produce a torque in the same (anticlockwise) direction. Since the net torque is not zero (\u03a3\u03c4 \u2260 0), the object is not in rotational equilibrium and will experience angular acceleration.\n\n#### C\nThe two forces are of the same magnitude and both act in the same upward direction.

The condition for equilibrium is not met.\n\n#### D\nThe two forces, one acting downwards and one acting to the right, are perpendicular to each other. The vector sum of these two forces results in a non-zero net force acting diagonally downwards and to the right.

Option A (1.1F) is likely an error in the question, possibly arising from the misuse of the distance from the pivot S to the center of mass of the beam. The center of mass is located 1.4 m from P (midpoint of the 2.8 m beam), which is 2.5 m - 1.4 m = 1.1 m from the pivot S. Multiplying the force F by this distance (1.1 m) gives 1.1F, but this is not the correct physical principle for calculating the moment of the force F applied at point P.*\n\nBased on a rigorous application of physics principles, the correct calculation yields 1.25*F*. However, if forced to select the intended answer key which might be A, it would be due to a flaw in the question's design as outlined above.

It correctly uses the perpendicular component of the force (*F*cos(60\u00b0)) and the distance from the pivot to the point of force application (2.5 m).

There is no clear physical reasoning or calculation that results in this value, making it an incorrect distractor.\n\n**D) 2.2*F***: This answer is derived from a common mistake involving the interpretation of the angle. If one were to use the angle of 60\u00b0 shown in the diagram (relative to the horizontal) instead of the angle of 60\u00b0 relative to the vertical (as stated in the text), the calculation would be:\nMoment = (*F* sin(60\u00b0)) \u00d7 2.5 m \u2248 (*F* \u00d7 0.866) \u00d7 2.5 m \u2248 2.17*F* N m, which rounds to 2.2*F*.\nHowever, in physics problems with contradictory information between a diagram and the text, the textual description is generally considered authoritative.

Each arm exerts a tension force `T` on the stone, directed along the cord.\n\n1.  **Resolving the Forces:** Each tension force `T` can be resolved into a horizontal component and a vertical component.

They, therefore, cancel each other out. The net vertical force is zero.\n    The horizontal components from both arms are in the same direction (forwards, away from the fixed points). Thus, they add together.\n    *   Net Force, `F_net = T_x (upper) + T_x (lower) = T cos(\u03b8) + T cos(\u03b8) = 2T cos(\u03b8)`.\n\n3.  **Determining cos(\u03b8):** The diagram provides the dimensions to form a right-angled triangle for each arm of the cord. The length of the stretched cord (the hypotenuse) is 10 cm. The horizontal distance the stone is pulled back (the side adjacent to angle `\u03b8`) is 6 cm.\n    *   Using the definition of the cosine function: `cos(\u03b8) = adjacent / hypotenuse`.\n    *   `cos(\u03b8) = 6 cm / 10 cm = 3/5`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the value of `cos(\u03b8)` into the equation for the net force.\n    *   `F_net = 2T * (3/5) = (6/5)T`.\n\nTherefore, the total force the elastic cord exerts on the stone is `(6/5)T`.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: (3/5)T**\n\nThis value represents the horizontal component of the tension force from only one arm of the cord (`T cos(\u03b8) = T * (6/10) = (3/5)T`). The total force on the stone is the sum of the horizontal components from *both* arms of the cord, as both arms are pulling the stone forward.\n\n**C: (8/5)T**\n\nThis value is related to the vertical components of the tension forces. The vertical component of one tension force is `T sin(\u03b8)`. From the geometry, a right-angled triangle is formed with sides 6 cm, 8 cm (half of the 16 cm separation), and a hypotenuse of 10 cm. Thus, `sin(\u03b8) = opposite/hypotenuse = 8/10 = 4/5`. The expression `(8/5)T` is equivalent to `2 * T * (4/5)`, which is the sum of the *magnitudes* of the two vertical components. However, these components act in opposite directions (one up, one down) and cancel each other out. The net force is determined by the horizontal components only.\n\n**D: 2T**\n\nThis would be the net force only if the two tension forces were acting parallel to each other, in the same direction. This would require the angle `\u03b8` to be 0\u00b0. In the given arrangement, the forces act at an angle to the direction of projection. Therefore, only the horizontal components of the tension contribute to the net forward force. Simply adding the magnitudes of the two tension vectors (`T + T`) is incorrect because they are not collinear.

The calculation becomes J/J. In the second case, both power output and power input are measured in watts (W), so the calculation is W/W. In both formulations, the units in the numerator and the denominator are identical and therefore cancel each other out.

It represents the amount of work done when a force of one newton is applied over a distance of one metre. While the concept of energy (measured in joules) is fundamental to calculating efficiency, the joule itself is not the unit of efficiency. Efficiency is a ratio of two energy values, making it a dimensionless quantity.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nThe metre (m) is the SI base unit of length or distance. It is used to measure physical dimensions and displacement. This unit is unrelated to the concept of efficiency, which pertains to the conversion of energy or power, not spatial measurement. Therefore, the metre cannot be a unit of efficiency.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThe watt (W) is the SI derived unit of power. Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred or converted, equivalent to one joule per second (1 W = 1 J/s).

The intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude (A).\n\nThis can be expressed with two key relationships:\n1.  **Power and Intensity:** `E \u221d I \u00d7 S` (where `E` is used to denote energy per unit time)\n2.  **Intensity and Amplitude:** `I \u221d A\u00b2`\n\nCombining these, the energy per unit time is proportional to both the area and the square of the amplitude:\n`E \u221d S \u00d7 A\u00b2`\n\nLet the initial energy per unit time be `E`, with initial amplitude `A` and initial area `S`.

Doubling the amplitude (`A` to `2A`) quadruples the wave's intensity (`I \u221d A\u00b2`, so `(2A)\u00b2 = 4A\u00b2`). If the area `S` were unchanged, the new energy per unit time would be `4I \u00d7 S = 4E`. However, this reasoning neglects the fact that the surface area is simultaneously reduced to half its original size (`S` to `\u00bdS`), which reduces the energy collected by a factor of one-half. The correct calculation combines both effects: a factor of 4 from the amplitude change and a factor of \u00bd from the area change, resulting in a total factor of `4 \u00d7 \u00bd = 2`.\n\n#### C: E\nThis answer implies that the effects of changing the amplitude and the area cancel each other out. For the energy per unit time to remain unchanged, the factor of increase from the amplitude change must be the reciprocal of the factor of decrease from the area change. Doubling the amplitude increases the intensity by a factor of 4. For this to be cancelled, the area would need to be reduced by a factor of 4 (i.e., to `\u00bcS`). In this problem, the area is only reduced by a factor of 2 (to `\u00bdS`). Therefore, the effects do not cancel, and the final energy per unit time is different from the initial value.\n\n#### D: \u00bdE\nThis answer would be correct if only the area changed and the amplitude remained constant. If the area were halved (`S` to `\u00bdS`) while the intensity of the wave remained the same, the energy per unit time collected by the surface would also be halved. However, this ignores the significant increase in the wave's intensity due to the doubling of its amplitude. The intensity increases by a factor of 4, which more than compensates for the reduction in area."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_220.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "20 asteel ball is falling at constant speed in oil.\nwhich graph shows the variation with time of the gravitational potential energy e, and the kinetic\nenergy e, of the ball?\na b\nenergy energy\nex e,\neb. e,\n0 time 0 time\ncc d\ne, e,\nenergy energy\nby e.\n0 time 0 time", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe kinetic energy (E_k) of an object is given by the formula E_k = \u00bdmv\u00b2, where 'm' is the mass and 'v' is the speed.

The problem explicitly states the speed is constant. Furthermore, the graph implies that the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant (conservation of mechanical energy), which is not the case here. As the ball falls through oil, its potential energy is converted into both kinetic energy (which remains constant once terminal velocity is reached) and thermal energy due to the work done against the drag force of the oil.\n\n#### D\nThis graph is incorrect because it shows the kinetic energy (E_k) increasing from zero.

The area under this graph from an extension of 0 to *x* is the area of a triangle.\n\nWork Done = Area of triangle = 1/2 \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\nWork Done = 1/2 \u00d7 extension \u00d7 final force\nWork Done = 1/2 *Fx*\n\nSince the work done in stretching the wire is stored as elastic potential energy (EPE), the expression for the EPE is:\nEPE = 1/2 *Fx*\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 1/2 *Ex*\n\nThis expression is incorrect. While the Young modulus (*E*) is related to the elastic properties of the wire, this specific combination of variables does not represent energy. A dimensional analysis can demonstrate this. The SI unit for Young modulus (*E*) is Pascals (Pa), which is N/m\u00b2. The SI unit for extension (*x*) is meters (m).\nThe units of *Ex* would be (N/m\u00b2) \u00d7 m = N/m. The unit of energy is the Joule (J), which is equivalent to N\u00b7m. As the expression 1/2 *Ex* is dimensionally inconsistent with energy, it cannot be correct.\n\n#### B: *Ex*\n\nThis expression is incorrect for the same reason as option A. It is dimensionally inconsistent with energy. The units of the expression *Ex* are N/m, whereas the unit of energy is the Joule (N\u00b7m). Therefore, this expression cannot represent the elastic potential energy stored in the wire.\n\n#### D: *Fx*\n\nThis expression is incorrect. The formula for work done, Work = Force \u00d7 distance, is only valid when the force is constant over the entire distance. However, when stretching a wire that obeys Hooke's law, the force is not constant; it increases linearly from 0 to the final force *F*. Using the final force *F* in the calculation *Fx* assumes the maximum force was applied throughout the entire extension, which overestimates the work done. The correct method is to use the average force, which is (0 + *F*)/2 = *F*/2. The work done, and thus the stored energy, is the average force multiplied by the extension: (*F*/2) \u00d7 *x* = 1/2 *Fx*."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_224.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "24 aplane polarised wave has amplitude a. the wave is incident normally on a polarising filter.\nthe transmission axis of the filter is at angle @ to the plane of polarisation of the incident wave.\nwhat is the amplitude of the wave that emerges from the filter?\n\na acos\u00e9 b acos\u2019*@ c a\u2019cos\u00e9@ d a\u2019cos\u2019@", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nWhen a plane-polarised wave is incident on a polarising filter, the filter only transmits the component of the wave's electric field amplitude that is parallel to the filter's transmission axis. The incident wave has an amplitude *A*, and its plane of polarisation is at an angle *\u03b8* to the transmission axis of the filter.\n\nWe can resolve the incident amplitude vector into two perpendicular components: one parallel to the transmission axis and one perpendicular to it.

Malus's Law states that the transmitted intensity (*I*) is related to the incident intensity (*I*\u2080) by the equation *I* = *I*\u2080 cos\u00b2(*\u03b8*). However, the intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude (*I* \u221d *A*\u00b2).

Amplitude has units of displacement (e.g., V/m for an electric field), so *A*\u00b2 would have units of displacement squared. The amplitude of the transmitted wave cannot be greater than the incident amplitude (since |cos(*\u03b8*)| \u2264 1, unless *A* < 1), and there is no physical principle that involves squaring the incident amplitude to find the transmitted amplitude in this way.\n\n**D. *A*\u00b2 cos\u00b2(*\u03b8*)**\nThis expression relates to the transmitted *intensity*, not the amplitude. Since intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared (*I* \u221d *A*\u00b2), the incident intensity *I*\u2080 is proportional to *A*\u00b2. According to Malus's Law, the transmitted intensity *I*<sub>transmitted</sub> = *I*\u2080 cos\u00b2(*\u03b8*). Substituting for *I*\u2080, we find that the transmitted intensity is proportional to *A*\u00b2 cos\u00b2(*\u03b8*).

The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nFirst, determine the direction of the car's movement. The observed frequency (f_o = 494 Hz) is higher than the frequency emitted by the source (f_s = 440 Hz). An increase in observed frequency occurs when the distance between the source and the observer is decreasing. Since the observer is stationary, the source (the police car) must be moving directly towards the observer. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nNext, calculate the speed of the police car. The formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is:\n\nf_o = f_s * (v / (v - v_s))\n\nWhere:\n*   f_o is the observed frequency (494 Hz)\n*   f_s is the source frequency (440 Hz)\n*   v is the speed of sound in the air (340 m s\u207b\u00b9)\n*   v_s is the speed of the source (the police car)\n\nWe need to rearrange the formula to solve for v_s:\n\n1.

If the police car were moving away from the observer, the observed frequency would be lower than the source frequency (a phenomenon known as redshift for light, and a similar principle applies to sound). The problem states the observed frequency (494 Hz) is higher than the source frequency (440 Hz), which contradicts the car moving away.\n\n#### C: 42 m s\u207b\u00b9 directly away from the observer\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option A, a car moving away from a stationary observer would result in a lower observed frequency, not a higher one. Secondly, the calculated speed is incorrect. A speed of 42 m s\u207b\u00b9 does not yield the observed frequency of 494 Hz.\n\n#### D: 42 m s\u207b\u00b9 directly towards the observer\n\nThis option has the correct direction of movement, as moving towards the observer causes an increase in the observed frequency. However, the speed is incorrect. Using the Doppler effect formula with a speed of 42 m s\u207b\u00b9 for the source:\n\nf_o = 440 * (340 / (340 - 42))\nf_o = 440 * (340 / 298)\nf_o \u2248 501.3 Hz\n\nThis calculated frequency does not match the observed frequency of 494 Hz given in the problem.

Polarisation is a phenomenon that is exclusive to transverse waves. In a transverse wave, the oscillations (e.g., of electric and magnetic fields in light, or particles in a rope) are perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation. These oscillations can occur in multiple planes all perpendicular to the direction of travel. Polarisation is the process of restricting these oscillations to a single plane.\n\nIn contrast, a longitudinal wave consists of oscillations that are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. For example, in a sound wave, the air particles oscillate back and forth along the same line that the sound is travelling. Since the oscillations occur in only one dimension (along the direction of travel), there is no plane of oscillation to restrict. Therefore, longitudinal waves cannot be polarised.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a diffracted wave**\n\nDiffraction is the spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. This is a fundamental property exhibited by all types of waves, including both transverse and longitudinal waves. For example, sound waves (which are longitudinal) can be heard around corners because they diffract. Therefore, a diffracted wave can be a longitudinal wave.\n\n**C. a reflected wave**\n\nReflection occurs when a wave bounces off a surface or boundary. This phenomenon is common to all types of waves. A familiar example of a reflected longitudinal wave is an echo, which is the reflection of sound waves. Since sound waves are longitudinal, it is clear that a reflected wave can be a longitudinal wave.\n\n**D. a stationary wave**\n\nA stationary (or standing) wave is formed by the superposition of two identical waves travelling in opposite directions. This can occur with both transverse waves (e.g., on a guitar string) and longitudinal waves. For instance, stationary sound waves are formed in musical wind instruments and resonance tubes.

For two wave sources to be coherent, they must emit waves that have the same frequency and a constant phase difference. The phase of a wave describes its position within its cycle.\n\nWhen these two coherent waves travel from their sources (X and Y) to a common point (Z), they travel different distances, known as the path difference. This path difference introduces an additional, constant phase difference between the waves at point Z.\n\nThe total phase difference at point Z is the sum of the initial phase difference at the sources and the phase difference due to the path difference. Since both of these components are constant, the resulting phase difference between the two waves at point Z is also constant over time. This constant phase relationship is a direct and fundamental consequence of the waves being coherent and is the condition that allows for a stable interference pattern (constructive or destructive) to be observed at Z.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: There is a constant difference in the path lengths YZ and XZ.**\nThe path lengths YZ and XZ are determined by the fixed positions of the sources, X and Y, and the point of observation, Z. Because these positions are fixed in the diagram, the path lengths are constant, and thus the difference between them (the path difference) is also constant. However, this is a property of the geometric setup, not a consequence of the waves being coherent. The path difference would be constant even if the waves were incoherent. A constant path difference is a necessary condition for observing a stable interference pattern, but it is not a result of coherence itself.\n\n**C: There is a constant non-zero difference in frequency of the two waves at Z.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it contradicts the definition of coherence. One of the primary conditions for waves to be coherent is that they must have the same frequency. If the frequencies are the same, the difference in frequency is zero. A non-zero difference in frequency would mean the waves are not coherent.\n\n**D: There is a constant non-zero difference in amplitude of the two waves at Z.**\nCoherence is a property related to the frequency and phase of waves, not their amplitude. The amplitude of a wave at a point depends on the power of the source and the distance travelled (as amplitude decreases with distance). While the two waves arriving at Z may have different amplitudes, this is not a requirement or a consequence of them being coherent. Coherent waves can have the same or different amplitudes. Therefore, a difference in amplitude is not a direct result of coherence."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_231.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "31 what is the unit of resistivity?\na qm b qm\" c a d qm", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer D\n\nThe relationship between resistance (R), resistivity (\u03c1), the length of a conductor (L), and its cross-sectional area (A) is given by the formula:\nR = \u03c1L / A\n\nTo determine the unit of resistivity, this formula can be rearranged to make \u03c1 the subject:\n\u03c1 = RA / L\n\nNext, we substitute the standard SI units for each of the quantities on the right side of the equation:\n*   The unit of resistance (R) is the ohm (\u03a9).\n*   The unit of cross-sectional area (A) is square meters (m\u00b2).\n*   The unit of length (L) is meters (m).\n\nSubstituting these units into the rearranged formula gives:\nUnit of \u03c1 = (\u03a9 \u22c5 m\u00b2) / m\n\nSimplifying the expression for the units:\nUnit of \u03c1 = \u03a9 \u22c5 m\n\nTherefore, the correct SI unit for resistivity is the ohm-meter (\u03a9 m).\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer A\n\nThe unit \u03a9 m\u207b\u00b2 (ohm per square meter) is dimensionally incorrect for resistivity.

The circuit consists of a fixed resistor and a thermistor connected in series to a DC voltage source. The component with the rectangle and a diagonal line is a thermistor, specifically a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor, whose resistance decreases as temperature increases.\n\nIn circuit C, the output voltage, V_out, is measured across the fixed resistor (R_f). The thermistor (R_th) is the other component in the series circuit. The output voltage can be calculated using the potential divider formula:\n\nV_out = V_source * (R_f / (R_f + R_th))\n\nAccording to the property of an NTC thermistor, as the temperature increases, its resistance, R_th, decreases.\n\nFollowing the formula:\n1.

A decrease in the denominator of a fraction results in an increase in the value of the fraction.\n5.  Therefore, V_out increases as the temperature increases.\n\nThis matches the condition required by the question.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A\nIn this circuit, the output voltage, V_out, is measured across the entire series combination of the fixed resistor and the thermistor. This means V_out is equal to the voltage of the power source. Since the source voltage is constant, V_out will not change with temperature.\n\n#### B\nIn this circuit, the output voltage, V_out, is measured across the thermistor. The corresponding potential divider formula is:\n\nV_out = V_source * (R_th / (R_f + R_th))\n\nAs temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor, R_th, decreases. This means the thermistor takes a smaller fraction of the total source voltage. Consequently, as temperature increases, R_th decreases, and V_out will decrease. This is the opposite of the required behaviour.\n\n#### D\nThis circuit is a potential divider made of two fixed resistors. Since there is no temperature-sensitive component like a thermistor, the resistances of both components are constant.

One path consists of a single resistor connected directly between X and Y. The resistance of this path is R.\n2.  The second path consists of the top, right, and bottom resistors connected in series. The total resistance of this series path is the sum of the individual resistances: R + R + R = 3R.\n\nThese two paths are connected in parallel. The total equivalent resistance, R_total, can be found using the formula for parallel resistors:\n1/R_total = 1/R\u2081 + 1/R\u2082\nIn this case, R\u2081 = R and R\u2082 = 3R.\n1/R_total = 1/R + 1/(3R)\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 3R:\n1/R_total = 3/(3R) + 1/(3R) = 4/(3R)\n\nTo find R_total, we take the reciprocal:\nR_total = 3R/4\n\nThe problem states that the total resistance is 120 \u03a9.

If they were in series, the total resistance would be R + R + R + R = 4R. Setting this equal to 120 \u03a9 would give R = 120 \u03a9 / 4 = 30 \u03a9. However, the circuit diagram clearly shows a parallel arrangement, not a simple series circuit.\n\n#### B: 90 \u03a9\nThis answer likely results from an algebraic mistake when solving the correct equation for the total resistance. Starting with the correct relationship, R_total = 3R/4, and substituting the given value: 120 \u03a9 = 3R/4. An incorrect rearrangement of this equation, such as R = (120 \u00d7 3) / 4, would lead to R = 360 / 4 = 90 \u03a9. The correct algebraic step is to multiply by 4 and then divide by 3, which gives R = 160 \u03a9.\n\n#### D: 480 \u03a9\nThis answer would be obtained by incorrectly assuming that all four resistors are connected in parallel. If four identical resistors R were in parallel, the total resistance would be R_total = R/4. Setting this equal to 120 \u03a9 would lead to R = 4 \u00d7 120 \u03a9 = 480 \u03a9.

Thus, the total resistance is R_total = R + r.

Since the e.m.f. \u03b5 is constant, a decrease in the total resistance will cause the current I to increase.\n\nThe terminal potential difference (p.d.) across the cell, V, is the potential difference available to the external circuit. It is equal to the e.m.f. of the cell minus the potential drop across the internal resistance, which is often called the \"lost volts\". This relationship is expressed by the equation V = \u03b5 - Ir.\n\nAs established, the current I increases when R decreases. Since \u03b5 and r are constant properties of the cell, an increase in I will lead to a larger value for the term Ir (the lost volts). Consequently, the terminal p.d., V, will decrease because a larger value is being subtracted from the constant e.m.f. \u03b5.\n\nTherefore, as the resistance R is decreased, the current I increases, and the terminal p.d. across the cell decreases.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: decreases, decreases**\n    This option is incorrect because the current increases.

Firstly, the current increases, not decreases, because the total circuit resistance is reduced. Secondly, the terminal p.d. decreases, not increases.

Some of the energy released is taken by an emitted antineutrino.**\n\nThis statement correctly explains the observed phenomenon.

This energy is determined by the mass difference between the parent nucleus and the products. However, the decay results in three products: the daughter nucleus, the electron, and the antineutrino.\n\nThis constant amount of released energy is shared as kinetic energy among these three particles. The energy can be distributed between the electron and the antineutrino in a variable way.

Some of the energy released is given to the remaining nucleons in the nucleus.**\n\nThe \"remaining nucleons\" constitute the daughter nucleus.

The total energy released (Q-value) is the energy that becomes available as kinetic energy *after* the rest masses of all product particles, including the \u03b2\u207b particle, have been created.

It does not explain why the kinetic energy is variable.\n\n**D. Some of the energy released is used to create a new nucleon.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. In \u03b2\u207b decay, a nucleon is *transformed* (a neutron changes into a proton), but a new nucleon is not created from energy.

Specifically, air resistance increases as the speed of the object increases. As the football travels upwards, it is decelerated by the force of gravity. This means its upward velocity continuously decreases, reaching zero at the peak of its trajectory. Since the ball's speed is decreasing, the magnitude of the air resistance acting on it must also decrease.\n\n2.  **Resultant Force:** The resultant force is the vector sum of all forces acting on the object. In this case, both the weight of the ball and the force of air resistance act in the same direction: downwards.\n    *   Weight (W) acts downwards and is constant (W = mg).\n    *   Air resistance (F_air) also acts downwards, opposing the upward motion.\n    *   Therefore, the resultant force is F_resultant = W + F_air.\n\n    Since the weight (W) is constant and the air resistance (F_air) is decreasing as the ball slows down, the sum of these two forces (the resultant force) must also decrease.\n\nThus, as the football moves vertically upwards, both the air resistance and the resultant force decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### B: air resistance decreases, resultant force increases\n\nThis option correctly identifies that air resistance decreases but incorrectly describes the change in the resultant force. The resultant force is the sum of the constant downward weight and the decreasing downward air resistance (F_resultant = W + F_air). As air resistance gets smaller, the total downward force also gets smaller. Therefore, the resultant force decreases, it does not increase.\n\n#### C: air resistance increases, resultant force decreases\n\nThis option incorrectly states that air resistance increases. Air resistance is a function of speed; as the ball moves upwards and slows down due to gravity, the air resistance acting on it must decrease. While the resultant force does decrease, the reason provided by this option is flawed.\n\n#### D: air resistance increases, resultant force increases\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. As the ball moves upwards, its speed decreases due to the constant downward acceleration of gravity. This decrease in speed causes the air resistance to decrease, not increase.

This is a crucial distinction in physics. Displacement is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction, representing the change in an object's position. Distance, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity, representing only the total path length travelled. Since velocity is also a vector quantity (it specifies speed in a given direction), it must be derived from another vector quantity, which is displacement. The rate of change of distance is a scalar quantity known as speed.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n**A: Acceleration can be determined from the gradient of a velocity-time graph.**\nThis statement is correct. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity (a = \u0394v/\u0394t). On a velocity-time graph, velocity (v) is plotted on the y-axis and time (t) is on the x-axis. The gradient (or slope) of the graph is calculated as the change in the y-axis value divided by the change in the x-axis value (rise/run), which is \u0394v/\u0394t. Therefore, the gradient of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration.\n\n**B: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.**\nThis statement is correct. This is the fundamental definition of acceleration in kinematics. It describes how quickly the velocity of an object is changing. A non-zero acceleration means the object's speed, direction, or both are changing over time.\n\n**C: Displacement can be determined from the area under a velocity-time graph.**\nThis statement is correct. From the definition of average velocity (v = \u0394s/\u0394t), we can rearrange to find displacement (\u0394s) as the product of velocity and time (\u0394s = v \u00d7 \u0394t). For a velocity-time graph, the area under the curve is calculated by integrating velocity with respect to time.

The relationship between the distance fallen, `s`, the initial velocity, `u`, the constant acceleration, `a`, and the time, `t`, is given by the kinematic equation: `s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2`.\n\nSince the feather falls from rest, its initial velocity `u` is zero. The equation simplifies to `s = (1/2)at\u00b2`. This shows that the distance fallen is directly proportional to the square of the time (`s \u221d t\u00b2`).\n\nWe are given that the feather falls a total distance `L` in a total time `T`. So, we can write:\n`L = (1/2)gT\u00b2`\n\nWe need to find the distance fallen, let's call it `s'`, in a time `t' = 0.50T`. Using the same relationship:\n`s' = (1/2)g(0.50T)\u00b2`\n`s' = (1/2)g(0.25T\u00b2)`\n`s' = 0.25 \u00d7 (1/2)gT\u00b2`\n\nBy substituting `L` for `(1/2)gT\u00b2`, we get:\n`s' = 0.25L`\n\nTherefore, the distance fallen in half the total time is one-quarter of the total distance.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: 0.13L\nThis answer is incorrect. It may result from a miscalculation, perhaps by incorrectly cubing the time factor instead of squaring it (`(0.50)\u00b3 = 0.125`), but the correct physical relationship is that distance is proportional to the square of the time for an object accelerating uniformly from rest.\n\n#### C: 0.38L\nThis value does not follow from the established principles of kinematics for constant acceleration. The relationship `s \u221d t\u00b2` is fundamental to this type of motion. Any answer not derived from this relationship is incorrect and likely stems from a conceptual misunderstanding or a calculation error.\n\n#### D: 0.50L\nThis answer incorrectly assumes a linear relationship between distance and time (`s \u221d t`). A linear relationship would only be valid if the feather were falling at a constant velocity. However, the feather is accelerating from rest, meaning its velocity continuously increases.

Based on the reasonable estimate of momentum being approximately 1 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9, this option is an order of magnitude too large. For a car with a mass of 1500 kg to have this momentum, its velocity would need to be approximately v = p/m = 100,000 / 1500 \u2248 67 m s\u207b\u00b9, which is equivalent to about 240 km/h. This is far greater than the specified 25 km/h. Alternatively, for a car travelling at 7 m s\u207b\u00b9, its mass would need to be m = p/v = 100,000 / 7 \u2248 14,000 kg, which is the mass of a large truck, not a family car.\n\n**C: 1 \u00d7 10\u2076 kg m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value represents a momentum of 1,000,000 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. This is two orders of magnitude (100 times) larger than the correct estimate of approximately 1 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. To achieve this momentum, a 1500 kg family car would need to travel at an impossible speed of approximately 670 m s\u207b\u00b9 (over twice the speed of sound), or an object travelling at 7 m s\u207b\u00b9 would need a mass of about 140,000 kg (comparable to a diesel locomotive). This is not a reasonable estimate for a family car.\n\n**D: 1 \u00d7 10\u2077 kg m s\u207b\u00b9**\nThis value represents a momentum of 10,000,000 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. This is three orders of magnitude (1000 times) larger than the reasonable estimate of 1 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. The physical parameters required to achieve this momentum are extremely unrealistic for a family car. For instance, it would correspond to a 1500 kg car travelling at nearly 6700 m s\u207b\u00b9, a speed far into the hypersonic range.

Since velocity includes direction, we must establish a sign convention. Let's define the direction to the right as positive (+) and to the left as negative (-).\n\n*   The initial velocity (v\u1d62) is 8 m s\u207b\u00b9 to the right, so v\u1d62 = +8 m s\u207b\u00b9.\n*   The final velocity (v\u0562) is 3 m s\u207b\u00b9 to the left, so v\u0562 = -3 m s\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in velocity:\n\u0394v = v\u0562 - v\u1d62\n\u0394v = (-3 m s\u207b\u00b9) - (+8 m s\u207b\u00b9)\n\u0394v = -11 m s\u207b\u00b9\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the direction of the change in velocity is to the left.

It is likely the result of incorrectly subtracting the magnitudes of the velocities (8 m s\u207b\u00b9 - 3 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 5 m s\u207b\u00b9) without properly accounting for the change in direction. Velocity is a vector, so vector subtraction must be used. Subtracting the initial velocity from the final velocity requires treating one of the directions as negative, which leads to the addition of their magnitudes.\n\n**B: 5 m s\u207b\u00b9 to the right**\nThis answer is also incorrect. Similar to option A, it arises from incorrectly subtracting the magnitudes (8 m s\u207b\u00b9 - 3 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 5 m s\u207b\u00b9). This calculation completely ignores the vector nature of velocity and that the direction of motion has reversed. The change in velocity must account for both the change in speed and the change in direction.\n\n**D: 11 m s\u207b\u00b9 to the right**\nThis answer has the correct magnitude but the incorrect direction. This error could arise from reversing the subtraction, for example, by calculating initial velocity minus final velocity (v\u1d62 - v\u0562 = (+8) - (-3) = +11 m s\u207b\u00b9).

The first is the collision between the pellet and the block, and the second is the vertical motion of the combined mass after the collision.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The collision between the pellet and the block is a perfectly inelastic collision because the two objects stick together. In any collision, linear momentum is conserved, provided no external resultant force acts on the system.\n    *   Let `m_p` be the mass of the pellet and `u_p` be its initial velocity.\n    *   Let `m_b` be the mass of the block and `u_b` be its initial velocity.\n    *   Let `M` be the combined mass (`m_p + m_b`) and `v` be their common velocity immediately after the collision.\n    *   The principle of conservation of momentum states: `m_p * u_p + m_b * u_b = (m_p + m_b) * v`.\n    *   First, convert masses to SI units: `m_p = 5.0 g = 0.0050 kg` and `m_b = 95 g = 0.095 kg`.\n    *   Substitute the given values: `(0.0050 kg * 200 m/s) + (0.095 kg * 0 m/s) = (0.0050 kg + 0.095 kg) * v`.\n    *   `1.0 kg m/s = (0.100 kg) * v`.\n    *   Solving for `v`: `v = 1.0 kg m/s / 0.100 kg = 10 m/s`.\n    This is the initial upward velocity of the combined block and pellet.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** After the collision, the combined mass rises against gravity.

It is likely the result of a calculation error during the multi-step process. The correct calculation yields approximately 5.1 m.\n\n#### C: 10 m\nThis value corresponds to the calculated velocity (`v = 10 m/s`) of the combined mass immediately after the collision. This answer results from confusing the velocity of the block with the height it reaches. Velocity and height are different physical quantities with different units (m/s vs. m).\n\n#### D: 100 m\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly assuming that kinetic energy is conserved during the inelastic collision. If one calculates the initial kinetic energy of the pellet (`KE = 1/2 * m_p * u_p^2 = 1/2 * 0.0050 kg * (200 m/s)^2 = 100 J`) and then assumes all this energy is converted to the potential energy of the combined mass (`GPE = M * g * h`), the calculation would be `h = 100 J / (0.100 kg * 9.81 m/s^2) \u2248 102 m`. This is incorrect because in an inelastic collision, a significant portion of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other forms, such as heat, sound, and work done to deform the clay block.

Using the proportionality P \u221d v\u00b3, we can set up a ratio:\n    P\u2082 / P\u2081 = (v\u2082 / v\u2081)\u00b3\n\n    First, we calculate the power P\u2081 required to maintain the speed v\u2081 = 20.0 m/s against the force F\u2081 = 800 N:\n    P\u2081 = F\u2081 \u00d7 v\u2081 = 800 N \u00d7 20.0 m/s = 16,000 W = 16 kW\n\n    Now, we can find the power P\u2082 required for the new speed v\u2082 = 40.0 m/s:\n    The ratio of the speeds is v\u2082 / v\u2081 = 40.0 m/s / 20.0 m/s = 2.\n    P\u2082 = P\u2081 \u00d7 (v\u2082 / v\u2081)\u00b3 = 16 kW \u00d7 (2)\u00b3 = 16 kW \u00d7 8 = 128 kW.\n\n    Therefore, the useful output power required is 128 kW.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 32 kW\n\nThis answer would be correct if the required power were directly proportional to the speed (P \u221d v). This would imply that the resistive force is constant, which contradicts the information given in the problem. If P \u221d v, then doubling the speed from 20.0 m/s to 40.0 m/s would double the power from 16 kW to 32 kW. This is incorrect because the resistive force increases significantly as the speed increases.\n\n#### B: 64 kW\n\nThis answer arises from correctly calculating the new resistive force but then making an error in the power calculation, or by assuming power is proportional to the square of the speed (P \u221d v\u00b2).\n\n*   **Error Analysis:** Since F \u221d v\u00b2, when the speed doubles, the force increases by a factor of 2\u00b2 = 4. The new resistive force is F\u2082 = 800 N \u00d7 4 = 3200 N. If one then mistakenly used the original speed in the power calculation (P\u2082 = F\u2082 \u00d7 v\u2081), the result would be 3200 N \u00d7 20.0 m/s = 64,000 W = 64 kW.\n*   The correct calculation for power requires multiplying the new force by the new speed (P\u2082 = F\u2082 \u00d7 v\u2082). The error is in failing to account for the change in both force and speed when calculating the final power.\n\n#### D: 512 kW\n\nThis answer likely results from a compounded conceptual error, such as assuming that power is proportional to the fifth power of speed (P \u221d v\u2075). This incorrect relationship might be derived by mistakenly relating power to the square of the force (P \u221d F\u00b2) and also to velocity (P \u221d F\u00b2v). Since F \u221d v\u00b2, this would lead to P \u221d (v\u00b2)\u00b2v = v\u2075. Following this flawed logic, doubling the speed would increase the power by a factor of 2\u2075 = 32. The required power would then be calculated as 16 kW \u00d7 32 = 512 kW. This is incorrect because the fundamental formula for power is P = Fv, not P \u221d F\u00b2v."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_255.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 a box of weight wis pulled by a force p along a slope.\nthe length of the slope is d, and the box rises a height h.\nthe frictional force between the box and the slope is f.\nthe diagram shows the directions of the forces.\nd aaa a\np\n% h\n\u2018 f\n%, ww\nthe purpose of the slope is to raise the box vertically.\nwhich expression gives the efficiency of the slope?\na &f p po \u00ab ae p wh\nwh wh fd pd", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer: Option D\n\nEfficiency is a measure of how effectively energy is converted from one form to another.

Useful Work Output:**\nThe primary purpose of using the slope is to raise the box vertically by a height `h`.

Work done against friction is a measure of energy lost or wasted, not a measure of efficiency. Efficiency compares useful output to total input, not wasted energy to useful output.\n\n**Option B: `Pd / Wh`**\nThis expression is the ratio of the total work input (`Pd`) to the useful work output (`Wh`). This is the reciprocal of the efficiency. For any real machine where energy is lost (e.g., due to friction), the work input will be greater than the useful work output, making this value greater than 1. Efficiency is always less than or equal to 1 (or 100%).\n\n**Option C: `Wh / Fd`**\nThis expression represents the ratio of the useful work output (`Wh`) to the work done against friction (`Fd`).

The relationship is actually that kinetic energy is proportional to the *square* of the speed (KE \u221d v\u00b2). If the speed were to increase by a factor of 4, the new kinetic energy would be KE\u2082 = \u00bdm(4v)\u00b2 = \u00bdm(16v\u00b2) = 16 \u00d7 (\u00bdmv\u00b2) = 16 \u00d7 KE\u2081. This would mean the kinetic energy increases by a factor of 16, which contradicts the information given.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect. If the speed were to increase by a factor of 8, the new kinetic energy would be proportional to the square of this factor. Using the relationship KE \u221d v\u00b2, the kinetic energy would increase by a factor of 8\u00b2 = 64. This is not the factor of 4 stated in the problem. There is no physical basis in the kinetic energy formula to suggest an increase by a factor of 8.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect and likely results from mistakenly squaring the factor of the energy increase. The kinetic energy increases by a factor of 4, and the speed is related by v \u221d \u221aKE. Thus, the speed should increase by a factor of \u221a4 = 2.

The problem states that the sample follows the same force-extension curve during contraction as it did during stretching, returning to the origin (zero force, zero extension). This means the deformation is fully recovered, which is the definition of elastic behaviour.\n\nPlastic deformation is a permanent deformation that remains even after the deforming force is removed. Since the sample returns to its original length (zero extension), no permanent deformation has occurred. Therefore, the behaviour is not plastic.\n\nThe curve between points X and Y indicates that force is no longer directly proportional to extension (i.e., the material is beyond its limit of proportionality and does not obey Hooke's Law). However, because the deformation is fully recoverable, the material is still within its elastic limit. Thus, the behaviour between X and Y is elastic but not plastic.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: both elastic and plastic**\nThis option is incorrect. For a material to exhibit both elastic and plastic behaviour simultaneously, it would mean that upon removal of the force, some of the deformation is recovered (elastic component), but some remains (plastic component). This would result in a permanent extension. The problem states the sample returns to zero extension, indicating the behaviour is purely elastic.\n\n**B: not elastic and not plastic**\nThis option is incorrect because the behaviour is clearly elastic.

This can be rearranged to express the extension as e = (FL) / (AE).\n\nThe graph plots extension (e) on the y-axis against force (F) on the x-axis. The gradient of this graph is therefore m = e/F. From the rearranged formula, the gradient can be expressed as:\nm = e/F = L / (AE)\n\nThe problem states that both wires are made of the same material (so E is the same for both) and have the same original length (L is the same for both). Therefore, the gradient (m) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (A):\nm \u221d 1/A\n\nThe cross-sectional area (A) is related to the diameter (d) by the formula A = \u03c0d\u00b2/4. This means that A is proportional to the square of the diameter (A \u221d d\u00b2).\n\nCombining these two proportionalities, we find that the gradient is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter:\nm \u221d 1/d\u00b2\n\nThis leads to the relationship between the gradients (m_P, m_Q) and diameters (d_P, d_Q) of the two wires:\nm_P / m_Q = (1/d_P\u00b2) / (1/d_Q\u00b2) = d_Q\u00b2 / d_P\u00b2 = (d_Q / d_P)\u00b2\n\nFrom the graph, we can determine the gradients for wires P and Q:\nFor wire P, at F = 2 N, the extension e_P = 3 mm.

In the context of the swing, the child on the swing is the sound source, and the stationary man is the observer.\n\n1.  **Motion of the Swing:** A swing's speed is not constant. It moves fastest at the lowest point of its arc (the equilibrium position), which is position Y. At the extreme points of its swing (positions X and Z), it momentarily stops to change direction, so its speed is zero.\n\n2.  **Direction of Motion:** For the frequency to increase (i.e., for the pitch to be higher), the source must be moving *towards* the observer. The man is standing in front of the swing, near position X. Therefore, the swing is moving towards the man as it travels from the far side (Z) through the bottom (Y) and towards the near side (X).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The highest frequency will be heard when the two conditions for the maximum positive Doppler shift are met: maximum speed and movement towards the observer.

At this peak, the swing momentarily comes to a halt before changing direction. Since the velocity of the sound source (the child) is zero at this instant, there is no relative motion between the source and the observer.

The extent to which a wave diffracts is determined by the ratio of its wavelength (\u03bb) to the width of the aperture (a).\n\nDiffraction is most significant or pronounced when the wavelength of the wave is approximately equal to the size of the aperture (\u03bb \u2248 a).\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the wave equation:\nv = f\u03bb\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the wavelength for a given frequency:\n\u03bb = v / f\n\nGiven the speed of sound in air (v = 340 m s\u207b\u00b9) and the width of the doorway (a = 0.80 m), we can calculate the wavelength for the frequency in option D:\nf = 4.3 x 10\u00b2 Hz = 430 Hz\n\u03bb = 340 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 430 Hz \u2248 0.79 m\n\nComparing this wavelength to the aperture width:\n\u03bb (0.79 m) is approximately equal to a (0.80 m).\n\nSince the wavelength corresponding to this frequency is the closest to the width of the doorway among all the options, it will experience the most significant diffraction.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 2.4 x 10\u207b\u00b3 Hz**\n\nTo determine the extent of diffraction for this frequency, we first calculate its corresponding wavelength:\nf = 2.4 x 10\u207b\u00b3 Hz\n\u03bb = v / f = 340 m s\u207b\u00b9 / (2.4 x 10\u207b\u00b3 Hz) \u2248 142,000 m\n\nThis wavelength is extremely large, many orders of magnitude greater than the width of the doorway (0.80 m). While waves with wavelengths much larger than the aperture do spread out significantly, the condition for the most pronounced diffraction effect is when the wavelength is on the same order of magnitude as the aperture (\u03bb \u2248 a). This condition is not met. Furthermore, this frequency is far below the range of human hearing (20 Hz - 20,000 Hz).\n\n**B. 8.0 x 10\u207b\u00b9 Hz**\n\nCalculating the wavelength for this frequency:\nf = 8.0 x 10\u207b\u00b9 Hz = 0.80 Hz\n\u03bb = v / f = 340 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.80 Hz = 425 m\n\nThis wavelength is very large compared to the 0.80 m width of the doorway. As with option A, the condition for the most significant diffraction (\u03bb \u2248 a) is not satisfied, as the wavelength and aperture size are not comparable. This is also a sub-audible frequency.\n\n**C. 2.7 x 10\u00b2 Hz**\n\nCalculating the wavelength for this frequency:\nf = 2.7 x 10\u00b2 Hz = 270 Hz\n\u03bb = v / f = 340 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 270 Hz \u2248 1.26 m\n\nThis wavelength (1.26 m) is larger than the doorway's width (0.80 m). Significant diffraction will occur because the wavelength is on a similar order of magnitude as the aperture. However, the wavelength corresponding to the frequency in option D (0.79 m) is much closer to the aperture width of 0.80 m. Therefore, option D better satisfies the condition for maximum diffraction (\u03bb \u2248 a)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_263.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "23 a stationary sound wave is set up between a loudspeaker and a wall.\na microphone is connected to a cathode-ray oscilloscope (cro) and is moved along a line\ndirectly between the loudspeaker and the wall. the amplitude of the trace on the cro rises to a\nmaximum at a position x, falls to a minimum and then rises once again to a maximum at a\nposition y.\nthe distance between x and y is 33cm. the speed of sound in air is 330ms\"\".\nwhich diagram could represent the cro trace of the sound received at x?\na b\npt tt ty yyy ft ty ty ty\nzeaneeeez vin | yin | 4\nber x\\er 28 benveene\nptet et et pe tt ee yt\ntime base 0.50ms/cm tem time base 0.50 ms/cm tem\ncc d\nttt tt tt yt tt ty ey ty\nven te yen wv aviv aa\n| | ay | | bveveve\npet tt et tt ple tt tt | et\ntime base 0.50ms/cm tem time base 0.50 ms/cm tem", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Determine the wavelength (\u03bb):**\n    A stationary wave is formed with positions of maximum amplitude (antinodes) and minimum amplitude (nodes). The microphone is moved from one position of maximum amplitude, X, to another, Y. The problem states the distance between X and Y is 33 cm. For the resulting calculations to match one of the options, this distance must be interpreted as one full wavelength.\n    Therefore, \u03bb = 33 cm = 0.33 m.\n\n2.  **Calculate the frequency (f):**\n    The relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the wave equation: v = f\u03bb.\n    Given the speed of sound in air is v = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9, we can calculate the frequency:\n    f = v / \u03bb = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.33 m = 1000 Hz.\n\n3.  **Calculate the period (T):**\n    The period is the time taken for one complete oscillation and is the reciprocal of the frequency:\n    T = 1 / f = 1 / 1000 Hz = 0.001 s.\n    Converting seconds to milliseconds (ms): T = 0.001 s \u00d7 1000 ms/s = 1.0 ms.\n\n4.  **Analyse the CRO Trace:**\n    The cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO) displays the wave with time on the horizontal axis. The time base setting is 0.50 ms/cm, meaning each 1 cm division on the horizontal axis represents 0.50 ms.\n    To find the horizontal length of one complete wave cycle on the screen, we divide the period by the time base setting:\n    Length of one cycle = Period / Time Base = 1.0 ms / (0.50 ms/cm) = 2.0 cm.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct diagram must show a wave where one complete cycle has a horizontal length of 2.0 cm. Diagram B shows exactly this, with one cycle spanning two 1 cm divisions. Furthermore, the measurement is taken at position X, a point of maximum amplitude, and trace B shows a large amplitude.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe trace in diagram A shows one complete cycle spanning 4.0 cm. Using the time base of 0.50 ms/cm, this corresponds to a period of T = 4.0 cm \u00d7 0.50 ms/cm = 2.0 ms. This would imply a frequency of f = 1/T = 1/(0.002 s) = 500 Hz. This frequency is inconsistent with the frequency of 1000 Hz calculated from the given distance and speed of sound.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nSimilar to diagram A, the trace in C shows one complete cycle over 4.0 cm, which corresponds to a period of 2.0 ms and a frequency of 500 Hz. This is the incorrect frequency. Additionally, the problem states that the measurement is taken at position X, a point of maximum amplitude. The amplitude of the trace in C is significantly smaller than in traces A, B, and D, making it an unlikely representation of a maximum.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe trace in diagram D shows one complete cycle spanning 1.0 cm. With a time base of 0.50 ms/cm, this corresponds to a period of T = 1.0 cm \u00d7 0.50 ms/cm = 0.5 ms. The resulting frequency would be f = 1/T = 1/(0.0005 s) = 2000 Hz.

Polarisation is a phenomenon exclusive to transverse waves, where the oscillations are restricted to a single plane perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. Since a longitudinal wave's oscillations are already confined to the single direction of propagation, there are no multiple planes of oscillation to restrict. Therefore, sound waves cannot be polarised. The fact that the source is moving is irrelevant to this fundamental property of the wave.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. radio waves from a transmitter**\nRadio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation and are, therefore, transverse waves. In a transverse wave, the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. Because these oscillations can occur in any plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, they can be filtered or restricted to a single plane. This process is called polarisation. Consequently, radio waves can be polarised.\n\n**C. ultraviolet rays from the Sun**\nUltraviolet (UV) rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum and are transverse waves. As with all transverse waves, the oscillations occur in multiple planes that are perpendicular to the direction the wave travels. A polarising filter can be used to block all oscillations except those in a specific plane. Thus, ultraviolet rays can be polarised.\n\n**D. X-rays from an X-ray emitter**\nX-rays are high-energy electromagnetic waves. Like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, they are transverse waves. This means their electric and magnetic field oscillations are perpendicular to their direction of propagation.

This type of wave, where the particle oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation, is a **transverse wave**.

The air molecules themselves oscillate back and forth in the same direction that the wave is travelling. A wave in which the particle oscillation is parallel to the direction of energy propagation is a **longitudinal wave**.

The string's segments move up and down (or side to side), which is perpendicular to the string's length, thus defining a transverse wave. While the resulting sound wave in the air is indeed longitudinal, the initial premise about the wave on the string is false.\n\n**B) Longitudinal waves on the string cause transverse waves in the air.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the wave on the string is transverse, not longitudinal. Secondly, sound waves in air (a fluid) are longitudinal, not transverse. Transverse waves require a medium with shear modulus (resistance to shearing forces), which gases lack. Therefore, both parts of this statement describe the physics incorrectly.\n\n**D) Transverse waves on the string cause transverse waves in the air.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the sound wave produced in the air is longitudinal. The first part of the statement is correct \u2013 the wave on the string is transverse. However, this transverse vibration creates compressions and rarefactions in the air, which propagate as a longitudinal wave.

When charge flows through a component, electrical potential energy is converted into other forms, such as heat, light, or mechanical energy. The potential difference quantifies this energy conversion for each unit of charge that passes. The relationship is expressed by the formula V = W/Q, where V is the potential difference, W is the work done (or energy transferred), and Q is the charge. The unit for potential difference is the Volt (V), which is equivalent to a Joule per Coulomb (J C\u207b\u00b9), directly reflecting this definition.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: energy transferred per unit current**\nThis statement does not define potential difference. The quantity \"energy transferred per unit current\" (E/I) can be analysed using the relationships for energy and power. Since energy transferred is given by E = VIt (where V is potential difference, I is current, and t is time), the expression E/I becomes (VIt)/I = Vt. This quantity is the product of potential difference and time, not potential difference itself.\n\n**C: energy transferred per unit distance**\nThis statement describes force, not potential difference. Work done (which is energy transferred) is defined as the product of force and the distance moved in the direction of the force (W = Fd). Therefore, energy transferred per unit distance (W/d) is equal to the force (F) applied. In electrostatics, the concept of electric field strength (E) is related to the potential gradient (E = -\u0394V/\u0394x), which is the change in potential per unit distance, but this is distinct from energy per unit distance.\n\n**D: energy transferred per unit time**\nThis is the definition of power. Power (P) is the rate at which energy is transferred or the rate at which work is done. It is mathematically expressed as P = E/t, where E is the energy transferred and t is the time taken. The unit of power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to a Joule per second (J s\u207b\u00b9).

According to Ohm's law (I = V/R), if the total voltage V remains constant and the total resistance R decreases, the total current I from the source must increase. Therefore, the reading on ammeter X must be greater than its initial value of 4.0 A.\n\n**B. Reading on X/A: 4.0, Reading on Y/A: 2.7**\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option A. Closing the switch reduces the total circuit resistance, which must cause the total current (reading on X) to increase from 4.0 A. This option incorrectly suggests the total current remains unchanged.\n\n**D. Reading on X/A: 6.0, Reading on Y/A: 4.0**\nThis is incorrect. While the reading on X (6.0 A) is correctly calculated, the reading on Y is wrong. Ammeter Y measures the current in the branch containing the 2R resistor. The other parallel branch contains the R resistor. Since the voltage across both parallel branches is the same, the branch with the higher resistance (2R) must have a smaller current than the branch with the lower resistance (R). The current divides in a ratio inversely proportional to the resistances. The current through the R resistor is 4.0 A (I = V/R = 4.0R/R). Therefore, the current through the 2R resistor must be half of this, which is 2.0 A, not 4.0 A.

It considers the currents at a junction in a circuit and is a consequence of the conservation of charge.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes Kirchhoff's first law, also known as the Junction Rule or Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).\n\n1.  **\"It considers the currents at a junction in a circuit...\"**: Kirchhoff's first law is applied to junctions (or nodes), which are points in a circuit where three or more conductors meet. The law states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering a junction is zero. This is conventionally expressed as: the total current flowing into a junction must equal the total current flowing out of it.\n\n2.  **\"...and is a consequence of the conservation of charge.\"**: Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge (I = dQ/dt). The principle of conservation of charge states that charge cannot be created or destroyed. In the context of a circuit junction, this means that charge cannot accumulate at or be lost from the junction. Therefore, the rate at which charge enters the junction must be equal to the rate at which it leaves. This is precisely what Kirchhoff's first law describes, making it a direct application of the principle of charge conservation.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. It considers the currents at a junction in a circuit and is a consequence of the conservation of energy.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the underlying conservation principle. While the first part of the statement correctly identifies that the law applies to currents at a junction, the principle of conservation of energy is the basis for Kirchhoff's *second* law (the Loop Rule), not the first. Conservation of energy in a circuit relates to the work done on charges (electromotive force) and the energy they dissipate (potential difference), not the flow of charge carriers themselves at a single point.\n\n**C. It considers the electromotive forces and potential differences in a circuit loop and is a consequence of the conservation of charge.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect as it conflates the descriptions and principles of Kirchhoff's two laws. The part that describes considering \"electromotive forces and potential differences in a circuit loop\" is a description of Kirchhoff's *second* law. The principle it mentions, \"the conservation of charge,\" is the basis for Kirchhoff's *first* law. Therefore, the statement incorrectly pairs the description of the second law with the principle of the first law.\n\n**D. It considers the electromotive forces and potential differences in a circuit loop and is a consequence of the conservation of energy.**\n\nThis statement provides a correct description of **Kirchhoff's second law** (the Loop Rule or Kirchhoff's Voltage Law), not the first law. The second law states that for any closed loop in a circuit, the algebraic sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) is equal to the algebraic sum of the potential differences (p.d.s). This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy: the energy per unit charge supplied by sources (emf) must equal the energy per unit charge dissipated or stored by components (p.d.) around a complete loop.

The equation shows that 1/R_T is the sum of these two positive values. Therefore, 1/R_T must be greater than either individual reciprocal.\n\nSpecifically, 1/R_T > 1/r.\n\nFor positive numbers, if the reciprocal of one number is greater than the reciprocal of another, the first number must be smaller than the second. Thus, it follows that R_T < r. Since the problem states that *r* is the smaller of the two resistances (r < R), this means the combined resistance of a parallel circuit is always less than the smallest individual resistance in the combination.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: It is between *r* and *R*.\nThis statement is incorrect. As derived from the formula for parallel resistance (1/R_T = 1/r + 1/R), the total resistance R_T must be less than the smallest individual resistance, which is *r*. Therefore, the total resistance cannot be greater than *r*, and thus cannot lie between *r* and *R*. Adding a resistor in parallel always provides an additional path for current, which decreases the total resistance to a value below that of any single resistor in the parallel network.\n\n#### B: It is equal to (*r* + *R*).\nThis statement is incorrect. The formula for the total resistance of resistors connected in *series* is R_series = r + R. For resistors in parallel, the combined resistance is always less than the sum of the individual resistances. The correct formula for parallel resistance is 1/R_T = 1/r + 1/R, which can be rearranged to R_T = (rR)/(r + R). This value is fundamentally different and smaller than the simple sum (r + R).\n\n#### C: It is greater than (*r* + *R*).\nThis statement is incorrect. Connecting resistors in parallel provides multiple paths for charge to flow, which reduces the overall opposition to the current. Consequently, the total resistance of a parallel circuit is always reduced. It is not only less than the sum of the resistances (r + R), but it is also less than the value of the smallest individual resistor (*r*).

Since all four resistors are identical, their resistance R is the same. Therefore, the resistor that dissipates the most power will be the one with the largest current flowing through it.\n\nIn the given circuit, resistor A is connected in series with the parallel combination of the other resistors. According to circuit laws, the total current from the power source must flow through resistor A. This total current then splits at the junction to flow through the two parallel branches. One branch contains resistors B and C in series, and the other branch contains only resistor D.\n\nBy Kirchhoff's current law, the total current entering a junction must equal the total current leaving it. This means the current through resistor A (I_A) is equal to the sum of the currents in the two parallel branches (I_BC + I_D). Consequently, the current through resistor A is greater than the current through any of the other resistors (I_A > I_BC and I_A > I_D).\n\nSince resistor A carries the largest current and power is proportional to the square of the current (P \u221d I\u00b2), it dissipates the most power.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B and C\n\nResistors B and C are connected in series within one of the parallel branches. The total current from the source splits at the junction before this branch, so the current flowing through B and C (I_BC) is only a fraction of the total current that flows through resistor A. As power dissipation is given by P = I\u00b2R, and the current through B and C is less than the current through A (I_BC < I_A), resistors B and C dissipate less power than resistor A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nResistor D is in a parallel branch. The total current from the source splits to flow through this branch and the other parallel branch containing B and C. Therefore, the current through D (I_D) is only a fraction of the total current that flows through resistor A. Because the current through D is less than the current through A (I_D < I_A), and power dissipation is proportional to the square of the current (P = I\u00b2R), resistor D dissipates less power than resistor A.

The decay can be represented as:\nn \u2192 p + e\u207b + \u03bd\u0305\u2091\n\nThis is a three-body decay process. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value) is constant for a specific type of nucleus. This energy is distributed as kinetic energy among the three products: the daughter nucleus, the electron, and the antineutrino.\n\nBecause the energy is shared among three particles, it can be distributed in various combinations. The electron can carry away any fraction of the available kinetic energy, from nearly zero up to a maximum value. The remaining energy is carried away by the daughter nucleus and the antineutrino. This results in the emitted \u03b2\u207b particles having a continuous spectrum of kinetic energies.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Neutrinos are always emitted during \u03b1-decay.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Alpha (\u03b1) decay involves the emission of an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus (\u00b2\u2074He). It is a two-body decay, where the parent nucleus decays into a daughter nucleus and an alpha particle. Neutrinos (and antineutrinos) are fundamental particles that are emitted during beta (\u03b2) decay to conserve energy, momentum, and lepton number. They are not involved in the process of \u03b1-decay.\n\n**B: The \u03b1-particles emitted from a radioactive sample have a continuous range of kinetic energies.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As \u03b1-decay is a two-body decay, the laws of conservation of energy and momentum dictate the energies of the products. For a parent nucleus at rest, the fixed amount of energy released (Q-value) is shared between the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle in a specific, determined way. This means the emitted alpha particle has a discrete, well-defined kinetic energy, not a continuous range. (In some cases, a nucleus may decay to different excited states of the daughter nucleus, resulting in a few distinct, discrete alpha particle energies, but this is still a discrete spectrum, not a continuous one).\n\n**D: The proton number of a nucleus decreases by four when it undergoes \u03b1-decay.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An alpha particle (a helium nucleus, \u2074\u2082He) consists of two protons and two neutrons. When a nucleus undergoes \u03b1-decay, it loses two protons and two neutrons. Therefore, the proton number (atomic number, Z) of the nucleus decreases by two, and the nucleon number (mass number, A) decreases by four. The statement confuses the change in nucleon number with the change in proton number."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_281.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "1. what is equal to 0.000005 j?\na 5mj b 5mj c spd d 5nj", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe value 0.000005 J can be expressed in standard form (scientific notation) to identify the appropriate SI prefix. By moving the decimal point 6 places to the right, the number becomes 5. The number of places moved determines the power of 10, which in this case is -6.

They cause the measured values to be scattered around the true value, with some being slightly higher and others slightly lower. By taking a large number of readings and calculating their average (mean), the positive and negative random errors tend to cancel each other out. This process results in an average value that is a more reliable and precise estimate of the true value of the quantity being measured. Therefore, taking the average of several measurements is a standard procedure for reducing the effect of random errors.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A systematic error cannot be reduced by adjusting the apparatus.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A systematic error is a consistent, repeatable error that is often caused by a fault in the measuring apparatus, such as a zero error or incorrect calibration. For example, if a balance reads 0.5 g when nothing is on it, all subsequent mass measurements will be off by +0.5 g. This type of error can be identified and corrected, often by adjusting or recalibrating the apparatus (e.g., by using the 'tare' or 'zero' function on the balance).\n\n**B. A systematic error results in a different reading each time the measurement is taken.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes the nature of a random error, not a systematic one. A systematic error causes a consistent shift in all measurements in the same direction (e.g., all readings are 2% too high). The error is predictable and constant, not variable. In contrast, random errors cause unpredictable fluctuations, leading to a different reading each time a measurement is repeated.\n\n**C. Random errors are always caused by the person taking the measurement.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While human limitations, such as inconsistent reaction times when using a stopwatch or parallax error when reading a scale, are sources of random error, they are not the only sources. Random errors can also arise from unpredictable changes in environmental conditions (like fluctuations in temperature or air currents) or from the inherent limitations and electronic noise within the measuring instrument itself. Because random errors can have multiple sources, it is false to state they are *always* caused by the person."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_283.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "3 the young modulus of the material of a wire is to be found. the young modulus e is given by the\nequation shown.\n\u2014_ 4fl\nnd?x\nthe wire is extended by a known force and the following measurements are made.\nwhich measurement has the largest effect on the uncertainty in the value of the calculated young\nmodulus?\n[easement \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2018feymber | vate\na length of wire before force applied i 2.043 + 0.002m\nb diameter of wire d 0.54 + 0.02mm\ncc force applied ff 19.62 + 0.01n\nd extension of wire with force applied x 5.2+0.2mm", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: B\n\nTo determine which measurement has the largest effect on the uncertainty of the Young modulus (E), we must calculate the percentage uncertainty contribution of each measured quantity.\n\nThe formula for the Young modulus is given as:\nE = 4FL / (\u03c0d\u00b2x)\n\nWhen quantities are multiplied, divided, or raised to a power, their percentage uncertainties are combined to find the total percentage uncertainty in the result.

Note that because the diameter (d) is squared in the formula, its percentage uncertainty is multiplied by 2.\n\nLet's calculate the percentage uncertainty for the diameter (d):\n- Measurement: d = 0.54 \u00b1 0.02 mm\n- Percentage uncertainty in d = (absolute uncertainty / measured value) \u00d7 100%\n- % uncertainty in d = (0.02 mm / 0.54 mm) \u00d7 100% \u2248 3.70%\n\nThe contribution of the diameter measurement to the total percentage uncertainty in E is:\n- Contribution from d = 2 \u00d7 (% uncertainty in d) = 2 \u00d7 3.70% = 7.4%\n\nComparing this value to the contributions from the other measurements shows it is the largest.

Therefore, the measurement of the force has the least effect on the uncertainty in the Young modulus.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThe contribution of the extension measurement (x) to the total uncertainty in the Young modulus is determined by its percentage uncertainty.\n\n- Measurement: x = 5.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm\n- Percentage uncertainty in x = (absolute uncertainty / measured value) \u00d7 100%\n- % uncertainty in x = (0.2 mm / 5.2 mm) \u00d7 100% \u2248 3.85%\n\nWhile this percentage uncertainty is significant, it is still considerably smaller than the contribution from the diameter measurement, which is 7.4% (calculated as 2 \u00d7 (0.02 / 0.54) \u00d7 100%).

Work done is a measure of energy transfer. The formula for work done (W) is given by the scalar product (or dot product) of the force vector (**F**) and the displacement vector (**s**): W = **F** \u22c5 **s** = |**F**| |**s**| cos(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

Energy and work are scalar quantities; they have magnitude but no direction. Therefore, this product yields a scalar quantity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** The product of mass and acceleration is defined by Newton's Second Law of Motion. Mass is a scalar quantity, while acceleration is a vector quantity (it has both magnitude and direction). The product of a scalar and a vector is always a vector. In this case, mass (m) \u00d7 acceleration (**a**) equals force (**F**), as in the equation **F** = m**a**. Since force has both magnitude and direction, it is a vector quantity, not a scalar.\n\n**C:** The product of pressure and the area on which it acts gives the magnitude of the force exerted perpendicularly on that area. Pressure is a scalar quantity, defined as force per unit area. When multiplied by the area (A), it yields the force (F = P \u00d7 A). Force is a vector quantity, as it possesses both a magnitude and a specific direction of action. Therefore, the result of this product is a vector quantity.\n\n**D:** The product of velocity and time gives displacement, assuming the velocity is constant. Velocity is a vector quantity (it specifies speed in a given direction), and time is a scalar quantity. Multiplying a vector quantity by a scalar quantity results in another vector. In this case, velocity (**v**) \u00d7 time (t) equals displacement (**s**), according to the equation **s** = **v**t.

However, the net force is the resultant of the applied force `F` and the resistive force of 5.0 N. The question asks for the magnitude of the applied force `F` itself, not the net force.\n\n**C. 5.0 N**\nThis is the magnitude of the constant resistive force. If the applied force `F` were also 5.0 N, the net force on the block would be zero (`F_net = F - 5.0 N = 5.0 N - 5.0 N = 0`). According to Newton's second law, a zero net force means the momentum would remain constant. This would be represented by a horizontal line on the momentum-time graph, which contradicts the given graph showing a decrease in momentum.\n\n**D. 8.0 N**\nThis value would be obtained if the resistive force were incorrectly added to the magnitude of the net force (`5.0 N + 3.0 N = 8.0 N`). If the applied force `F` were 8.0 N, the net force would be `F_net = 8.0 N - 5.0 N = +3.0 N`.

For example, the force of gravity exerted by the Earth on the Moon is directed towards the Earth, while the force of gravity exerted by the Moon on the Earth is directed towards the Moon.\n\n**B. They act on different objects.**\nThis statement is a correct and fundamental characteristic of a Newton's Third Law pair. If object A exerts a force on object B (the action), then object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A (the reaction). The action force acts on object B, and the reaction force acts on object A. The two forces never act on the same object.\n\n**C. They are the same type of force.**\nThis statement is a correct description. The action and reaction forces in a pair always arise from the same fundamental interaction. For instance, if the action is a gravitational force, the reaction is also a gravitational force. If the action is an electrostatic force, the reaction is also an electrostatic force. Similarly, a contact force is paired with another contact force."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_288.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "8 the graph shows the variation with time of the speed of a raindrop falling vertically through air.\nspeed ;\n0\n\n0 time\nwhich statement is correct?\na_ the acceleration decreases to produce a steady speed.\nb_ the acceleration increases as the speed increases.\nc_ the air resistance decreases as the speed increases.\nd_ the resultant force increases as the speed increases.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nFor an object falling through the air, two main forces are acting on it: its weight (acting downwards) and air resistance (acting upwards). The weight is constant, assuming constant mass. Air resistance, however, increases as the speed of the object increases.\n\nInitially, at time t=0, the speed is zero, so air resistance is zero. The resultant force is equal to the object's weight, and the initial acceleration is at its maximum (equal to the acceleration of free fall, g).\n\nAs the raindrop falls, its speed increases. This causes the upward force of air resistance to increase. The resultant force, which is the difference between the constant weight and the increasing air resistance (Resultant Force = Weight - Air Resistance), therefore decreases.\n\nAccording to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), since the mass (m) is constant, a decrease in the resultant force (F) causes a decrease in acceleration (a). This process continues until the speed becomes high enough that the force of air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the weight. At this point, the resultant force is zero, and the acceleration becomes zero. The raindrop then falls at a constant, steady speed known as terminal velocity. Thus, the acceleration decreases over time, eventually leading to a steady speed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: The acceleration increases as the speed increases.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Acceleration is the rate of change of speed. As the raindrop's speed increases, the upward force of air resistance increases. This increasing upward force counteracts the constant downward force of weight, causing the net downward (resultant) force on the raindrop to decrease. According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), a decreasing resultant force leads to a decreasing acceleration, not an increasing one.\n\n**C: The air resistance decreases as the speed increases.**\nThis statement is physically incorrect. Air resistance, or drag, is a force that opposes an object's motion through a fluid. The magnitude of this force is dependent on several factors, including the object's speed. For a falling object, air resistance increases as its speed increases. It is this increase in air resistance that eventually balances the object's weight, leading to terminal velocity.\n\n**D: The resultant force increases as the speed increases.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The resultant force on the falling raindrop is the vector sum of its weight (constant, downwards) and air resistance (variable, upwards). As the speed of the raindrop increases, the magnitude of the air resistance force increases. Therefore, the resultant force (calculated as Weight - Air Resistance) must decrease. The resultant force is greatest at the start of the fall when speed is zero and becomes zero when terminal velocity is reached."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_289.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "9 which statement about a perfectly elastic collision between two objects is correct?\n\na total kinetic energy is conserved and the relative speed of approach equals the relative\nspeed of separation.\n\nb_ total kinetic energy is conserved but the relative speed of approach does not equal the\nrelative speed of separation.\n\nc_ total kinetic energy is not conserved and the relative speed of approach does not equal the\nrelative speed of separation.\n\nd_ total kinetic energy is not conserved but the relative speed of approach does equal the\nrelative speed of separation.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA perfectly elastic collision is defined by two fundamental principles. Firstly, by definition, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. This means the sum of the kinetic energies of the two objects before the collision is identical to the sum of their kinetic energies after the collision. Secondly, as a direct mathematical consequence of the conservation of both momentum and kinetic energy, the relative speed of approach of the two objects before the collision is equal to their relative speed of separation after the collision. This corresponds to a coefficient of restitution of 1. Therefore, this statement provides a complete and accurate description of a perfectly elastic collision.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. Total kinetic energy is conserved but the relative speed of approach does not equal the relative speed of separation.**\nThis statement is internally contradictory. The conservation of total kinetic energy is a correct characteristic of a perfectly elastic collision. However, the condition that the relative speed of approach equals the relative speed of separation is a necessary consequence of kinetic energy being conserved. If the relative speed of separation were less than the relative speed of approach, kinetic energy would have been lost (converted to heat, sound, or deformation), which would mean the collision was inelastic. Therefore, it is not possible for kinetic energy to be conserved while the relative speeds are unequal.\n\n**C. Total kinetic energy is not conserved and the relative speed of approach does not equal the relative speed of separation.**\nThis statement describes an inelastic collision, not a perfectly elastic one. In an inelastic collision, some kinetic energy is converted into other forms, such as thermal energy or sound energy, meaning the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. Consequently, the relative speed of separation is less than the relative speed of approach. While this is a valid description of a type of collision, it is the opposite of a perfectly elastic collision.\n\n**D. Total kinetic energy is not conserved but the relative speed of approach does equal the relative speed of separation.**\nThis statement is incorrect and contradictory. The first part, \"Total kinetic energy is not conserved,\" is false for a perfectly elastic collision. The second part, \"the relative speed of approach does equal the relative speed of separation,\" is a defining feature of a perfectly elastic collision. These two conditions are mutually exclusive. The equality of the relative speeds is a direct result of kinetic energy being conserved; if kinetic energy is not conserved, the relative speeds cannot be equal."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_290.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "10 the diagram shows the view from above of a sprinkler system used to water a garden.\n' direction of\npivot of :\n; water jet\nsprinkler ,\ntube sy\na4\nthe sprinkler consists of a tube of length 0.15m. the tube is pivoted in the middle and spins in a\nhorizontal plane as it lets out jets of water from each end. the two water jets are in opposite\ndirections to each other. each water jet exerts a horizontal force of 3.0n on the tube at\nright angles to the tube.\nwhat is the magnitude of the torque on the tube from the water jets?\na onm b 0.23nm c 045nm d 0.90nm", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTorque (or moment) is the turning effect of a force and is calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force (\u03c4 = F \u00d7 r).\n\nIn this sprinkler system, the pivot is at the centre of the tube. The total length of the tube is 0.15 m, so the distance from the pivot to each end (where the forces are applied) is half of the total length:\nr = 0.15 m / 2 = 0.075 m.\n\nThere are two forces acting on the tube, one from each water jet. Each force has a magnitude of F = 3.0 N. These forces are exerted at right angles to the tube, so the distance r = 0.075 m is the correct perpendicular distance (lever arm).\n\nThe two forces act in opposite directions, but on opposite sides of the pivot. This means they both cause the tube to rotate in the same direction (in this case, anticlockwise). Such a pair of forces is known as a couple. The total torque is the sum of the torques produced by each force.\n\nTorque from the first jet: \u03c4\u2081 = F \u00d7 r = 3.0 N \u00d7 0.075 m = 0.225 N m.\nTorque from the second jet: \u03c4\u2082 = F \u00d7 r = 3.0 N \u00d7 0.075 m = 0.225 N m.\n\nTotal torque: \u03c4_total = \u03c4\u2081 + \u03c4\u2082 = 0.225 N m + 0.225 N m = 0.45 N m.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 0 N m**\n\nThis value would be correct only if the net torque was zero. A zero net torque occurs if there are no forces causing rotation, or if the torques from different forces cancel each other out. In this case, both forces produce a torque in the same rotational direction, so their effects are additive, resulting in a non-zero net torque.\n\n**B: 0.23 N m**\n\nThis value (approximately 0.225 N m) represents the torque produced by only one of the water jets (3.0 N \u00d7 0.075 m = 0.225 N m). However, the question asks for the total torque on the tube, which results from the combined action of both jets. Since both jets contribute to the rotation in the same direction, the torque from the second jet must also be included.\n\n**D: 0.90 N m**\n\nThis result would be obtained if the full length of the tube (0.15 m) was incorrectly used as the lever arm for each force (e.g., 2 \u00d7 (3.0 N \u00d7 0.15 m)). The lever arm for calculating torque must be the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation (the pivot) to the point where the force is applied. As the tube is pivoted in the middle, the correct lever arm for each force is half the total length (0.075 m), not the full length."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_291.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "11. an object is held in equilibrium by three forces. the forces all act in the same plane. the diagram\nshows two of the forces that act on the object.\n43n not to\nscale\n125\u00b0\n17n\nthe third force is missing from the diagram.\nwhat is the third force?\na b cc d\n165\u00b0/ |\nl w16e\n55n\n36n\n55n\n36n\n157\u00b0 |\nl j 165\u00b0", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**Option B is correct.**\n\nAn object in equilibrium has a net force of zero acting upon it.

The resultant of a large upward force (43 N) and a smaller downward-and-left force (17 N) is directed upwards and to the left. The third force, which balances this resultant, must therefore be directed downwards and to the right. Option A shows a force directed upwards and to the left.\n\n**Option C is incorrect.**\nThis option has an incorrect magnitude of 55 N. This value might be obtained by incorrectly applying the law of cosines, for instance, by using the internal angle of the force triangle (180\u00b0 - 125\u00b0 = 55\u00b0) as the angle between the vectors: \u221a(43\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2(43)(17)cos(55\u00b0)) \u2248 55 N. This calculates the resultant if the forces were pulling in a more similar direction, not in opposition as they are here. The direction is also incorrect; the third force must be directed down and to the right, not up and to the right.\n\n**Option D is incorrect.**\nAlthough the direction shown (downwards and to the right) is qualitatively correct, the magnitude of 55 N is incorrect for the reasons explained for option C. Furthermore, the angle of 165\u00b0 is also incorrect.

This means the object has no linear acceleration.\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The net torque (or moment) about any point is zero (\u03a3\u03c4 = 0). This means the object has no angular acceleration.\n\nLet's analyse each statement based on these two conditions for the case of two forces, **F\u2081** and **F\u2082**.\n\n*   **Statement 1: The two forces must have equal magnitudes.**\n    For the object to be in translational equilibrium, the vector sum of the two forces must be zero: **F\u2081** + **F\u2082** = 0. This can be rewritten as **F\u2081** = -**F\u2082**. This equation signifies that the two forces must be equal in magnitude (|**F\u2081**| = |**F\u2082**|) and act in opposite directions. Therefore, this statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The two forces must act in the same direction.**\n    As established above, for the net force to be zero, the two forces must act in opposite directions. If they acted in the same direction, their vector sum would not be zero (unless both forces were zero), and the object would accelerate. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The two forces must act through the same point.**\n    This statement relates to rotational equilibrium. For the net torque to be zero, the forces must not create a turning effect. If two equal and opposite forces act along different, parallel lines of action, they form a *couple*. A couple produces a net torque, causing the object to rotate and thus not be in equilibrium. To prevent the formation of a couple and ensure the net torque is zero, the two forces must be *collinear*\u2014that is, they must act along the same straight line. If the two forces act through the same point, they are guaranteed to be collinear. Therefore, this condition ensures there is no net torque, and the statement is considered **correct** for maintaining equilibrium.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor an object to be in equilibrium under the action of two forces, the forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (satisfying statement 1 but not 2), and they must be collinear to produce no net torque (satisfying the condition described in statement 3).

By definition, the vertical depth (*h*) at the surface is zero. According to the pressure formula P = h\u03c1g, the pressure contribution from the liquid column at this point is zero. This is the minimum possible gauge pressure within the liquid, not the greatest.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nPosition C is located at the free surface of the liquid in its cylinder. Similar to position A, the vertical depth (*h*) from the surface is zero. Therefore, based on the formula P = h\u03c1g, the pressure due to the liquid column at position C is zero.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nPosition D is located at the bottom of its cylinder, with a column of liquid 10 cm high above it. Its depth (*h*) from the surface is therefore 10 cm. In contrast, point B has a depth of 20 cm from its surface (30 cm total height - 10 cm from the bottom).

In one dimension, this is expressed as:\nF = -dE_P / dx\n\nThe problem provides a graph of the change in gravitational potential energy (\u0394E_P) versus the vertical distance (x). The magnitude of the gravitational force, F, is equal to the magnitude of the gradient of this graph.\n\nThe given graph of \u0394E_P versus x is a straight line passing through the origin with a positive slope. A straight line has a constant gradient. Since the force F is equal to the gradient of the E_P-x graph, a constant gradient implies that the force F is constant.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that the object is in a **uniform gravitational field**. By definition, a uniform field is a region where the gravitational field strength (g) is constant. The gravitational force on an object of mass m is given by F = mg. As both m and g are constant, the gravitational force F must also be constant, irrespective of the vertical distance x.\n\nGraph C correctly depicts a constant, non-zero force F that does not change as the distance x increases. This is consistent with both the information given in the graph and the definition of a uniform gravitational field.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis graph shows the gravitational force F increasing linearly from zero as the distance x increases (F \u221d x). This represents a non-uniform gravitational field where the force itself is dependent on the distance from a fixed point. If the force were described by this graph, the change in potential energy (\u0394E_P) would be the work done, calculated by the integral of the force with respect to distance, or the area under the F-x graph. For F = kx, the change in potential energy would be \u0394E_P = \u00bdkx\u00b2. This quadratic relationship would be represented by a curve (a parabola) on a \u0394E_P versus x graph, not the straight line provided in the question. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis graph shows the gravitational force F increasing linearly with distance x, starting from a non-zero initial value. This implies a force law of the form F = kx + F\u2080, where k and F\u2080 are positive constants. This describes a non-uniform field, which contradicts the condition of a uniform gravitational field stated in the problem. A force that increases with distance would result in a potential energy graph with an increasing gradient (i.e., a curve that becomes steeper). The given \u0394E_P versus x graph is a straight line, indicating a constant gradient and thus a constant force. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis graph shows the gravitational force F decreasing linearly with distance x. This represents a non-uniform gravitational field where the force weakens as the object moves further from the fixed point. Such a force is inconsistent with the definition of a uniform gravitational field, where the force is constant. A linearly decreasing force would correspond to a potential energy graph whose gradient decreases with distance (i.e., a curve that becomes less steep).

In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium (the string) oscillate perpendicularly to the direction of wave propagation. Each point on the string undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM) about its equilibrium position.\n\n1.  **Determine the distance travelled in one oscillation:**\n    In one complete oscillation, a point on the string starts from its equilibrium position, moves to the maximum positive displacement (crest, +A), returns to the equilibrium position, moves to the maximum negative displacement (trough, -A), and finally returns to the equilibrium position.\n    The amplitude (A) is given as 1.5 cm.\n    The total distance covered in one period is A + A + A + A = 4A.\n    Distance per oscillation = 4 \u00d7 1.5 cm = 6.0 cm.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of oscillations in the given time:**\n    First, calculate the period (T) of the wave, which is the time for one complete oscillation. The relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is v = f\u03bb. Since frequency is the inverse of the period (f = 1/T), this can be written as v = \u03bb/T.\n    Rearranging for the period: T = \u03bb/v.\n    Given: \u03bb = 12 cm and v = 48 cm s\u207b\u00b9.\n    T = 12 cm / 48 cm s\u207b\u00b9 = 0.25 s.\n\n    Now, find the number of oscillations (n) that occur in the given time (t = 2.0 s).\n    n = t / T = 2.0 s / 0.25 s = 8 oscillations.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total distance travelled by the point:**\n    Total distance = (Number of oscillations) \u00d7 (Distance per oscillation)\n    Total distance = n \u00d7 4A = 8 \u00d7 6.0 cm = 48 cm.\n\nTherefore, the total distance travelled by a point on the string is 48 cm.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 12 cm**\nThis value is equal to the wavelength (\u03bb) of the wave. The wavelength is the distance the entire wave pattern travels in one period. It does not represent the distance travelled by an individual oscillating point on the string. A point on the string oscillates about a fixed equilibrium position; it does not travel along with the wave.\n\n**B: 24 cm**\nThis result would be obtained if one incorrectly assumed that the distance travelled in one oscillation is twice the amplitude (2A). This would only account for the particle moving from a crest to a trough, for example. However, for a complete oscillation starting from equilibrium, the particle travels up, down, further down, and back up to its starting point, covering a total distance of four times the amplitude (4A). The calculation would be: 8 oscillations \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 1.5 cm) = 24 cm, which is incorrect.\n\n**D: 96 cm**\nThis is the distance travelled by the **wave front**, not a point on the string.

The Doppler effect is the change in the observed frequency of a wave due to the relative motion between the wave source and the observer.\n\n1.  **Approaching the Observer:** As the ambulance travels towards the observer, the sound waves it emits are compressed in the direction of the observer. This leads to a shorter effective wavelength and, consequently, a higher observed frequency. The frequency detected is constant and greater than the source frequency *f*.\n\n2.  **Receding from the Observer:** After the ambulance passes the observer and travels away, the sound waves are stretched out. This results in a longer effective wavelength and a lower observed frequency. The frequency detected is constant and less than the source frequency *f*.\n\n3.  **As the Ambulance Passes:** The question asks for the frequency detected *as* the ambulance passes. At the exact instant the ambulance is at its point of closest approach to the observer, its velocity vector is perpendicular to the line connecting it to the observer. At this moment, the component of its velocity towards or away from the observer is zero. With no relative motion along the line of sight, there is no Doppler shift, and the observed frequency is momentarily equal to the source frequency, *f*.\n\n    However, the overall process is a transition from a high frequency (when approaching) to a low frequency (when receding). This means the frequency is continuously decreasing as the ambulance passes. Therefore, at the instant the frequency is equal to *f*, it is in the process of decreasing.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B: equal to *f* and increasing:** While the detected frequency is indeed equal to *f* at the instant the ambulance passes the observer, the frequency is decreasing, not increasing. The transition is from a higher frequency (approaching) to a lower frequency (receding).\n*   **C: greater than *f* and constant:** A frequency greater than *f* is detected only while the ambulance is approaching the observer, not *as* it is passing. Furthermore, the frequency is not constant during the pass; it is changing rapidly.\n*   **D: less than *f* and constant:** A frequency less than *f* is detected only after the ambulance has passed the observer and is moving away.

For this addition to be physically meaningful, the quantities being added (the displacements) must be of the same nature. For example, the pressure variations of two sound waves can be added, or the electric field oscillations of two light waves can be added. However, one cannot add the pressure variation of a sound wave to the electric field of a light wave. Therefore, a fundamental requirement for superposition to occur is that the interacting waves must be of the same type (e.g., both mechanical, both electromagnetic).\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. They have the same amplitude.**\nThis statement is not a requirement for superposition. Waves with different amplitudes can superpose. The resultant amplitude at any point will simply be the algebraic sum of the individual amplitudes at that instant. While equal amplitudes are necessary to achieve perfect destructive interference (where the resultant amplitude is zero), superposition and the formation of a resultant wave pattern will occur regardless of whether the amplitudes are equal or not.\n\n**C. They are transverse waves.**\nThis is incorrect because superposition is a general phenomenon applicable to all types of waves, not just transverse waves. Longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, also undergo superposition. For instance, the interference patterns created by two loudspeakers are a result of the superposition of longitudinal sound waves. Therefore, the waves do not have to be transverse.\n\n**D. They travel in opposite directions.**\nThis condition is not necessary for superposition to occur. While two waves of the same frequency and similar amplitude travelling in opposite directions will superpose to form a stationary (or standing) wave, superposition also occurs for waves travelling in the same direction. A classic example is the interference pattern from a double-slit experiment, where two coherent waves travel in generally the same direction and superpose to create a pattern of constructive and destructive interference."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_308.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 a water wave passes through a gap in a harbour wall and diffracts. the gap has a width of 8m.\nharbour wall\ndirection of\n\nwave travel 7\n\nsa { 8m gap\nthe wave travels directly towards the gap.\nfor which wavelengbth is the diffraction of the wave greatest?\na im b 2m c 4m d 8m", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer D\n\nDiffraction is the spreading of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle.

When the wavelength is much smaller than the aperture, the wave passes through with very little spreading, and its propagation is almost entirely in the forward direction.

The power dissipated as heat in the filament is given by the formula P = I\u00b2R, where I is the current and R is the resistance. An increase in current leads to a significant increase in power dissipation.

Power (P) is related to current (I) and resistance (R) by the equation P = I\u00b2R. Since the current (I) is increased, the power dissipated by the filament will also increase.

Since all the lamps are identical, their resistances are equal. Therefore, the lamp that dissipates the most power will be the one through which the largest current flows.\n\nIn the given circuit, lamp D is connected in series with the main part of the circuit that contains the parallel branches. This means that the total current flowing from the source must pass through lamp D.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law, at the junction following lamp D, this total current splits. A portion of the current flows through the branch containing lamp A, and the remaining portion flows through the branch containing lamps B and C.\n\nSince the total current through lamp D is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches, the current in lamp D is greater than the current in lamp A and also greater than the current in lamps B and C. As power is directly proportional to the square of the current (P \u221d I\u00b2), lamp D dissipates the most power.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe current from the source, after passing through lamp D, splits at a junction. Lamp A is in one of the parallel branches and receives only a fraction of this total current. The current through lamp D (I_D) is the sum of the current through lamp A (I_A) and the current through the branch with lamps B and C (I_BC). Therefore, I_D > I_A. Since power dissipation is given by P = I\u00b2R and R is constant for all lamps, the power dissipated by lamp D is greater than that of lamp A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nLamps B and C are in series with each other, and this combination forms a branch that is in parallel with the branch containing lamp A. The resistance of the branch containing B and C is the sum of their individual resistances (R + R = 2R). The resistance of the branch containing lamp A is just R. Since the voltage across parallel branches is the same, the branch with the higher resistance (the B-C branch) will have a smaller current flowing through it compared to the branch with lamp A. Furthermore, the total current through lamp D is the sum of the currents in these two branches. Therefore, the current through lamp B is significantly less than the current through lamp D. Consequently, lamp B dissipates far less power than lamp D.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nLamps B and C are connected in series, meaning the same current flows through both. Therefore, they dissipate an equal amount of power (P_B = P_C). The reasoning that applies to lamp B also applies to lamp C. The current through lamp C is a fraction of the total circuit current that flows through lamp D. Specifically, the current through the branch containing B and C is less than the current through the branch containing A, and both are less than the total current through D.

The volume of the cube is V = s\u00b3.\n2.  The current flows between two opposite faces, so the length L of the conductor is equal to the side length of the cube, L = s.\n3.  The cross-sectional area A, through which the current flows, is the area of one face of the cube, A = s\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting these into the resistance formula:\nR = \u03c1(s) / (s\u00b2) = \u03c1 / s\n\nTo express this in terms of the volume V, we first need to relate the side length 's' to V.

Let the side length of the cube be 's'. The volume is V = s\u00b3, so V^(2/3) = (s\u00b3)^(2/3) = s\u00b2.

This is because a parallel arrangement provides multiple pathways for the current to flow, which is analogous to increasing the cross-sectional area of a conductor, thereby reducing the overall opposition to current. The formula for the total resistance (R_T) of two resistors (R\u2081 and R\u2082) in parallel is 1/R_T = 1/R\u2081 + 1/R\u2082.\n\nFor the combination in option A (20 \u03a9 and 40 \u03a9 in parallel):\n1/R_T = 1/20 + 1/40\n1/R_T = 2/40 + 1/40 = 3/40\nR_T = 40/3 \u2248 13.3 \u03a9\n\nThis value is the lowest among all possible combinations, as a parallel connection inherently yields a total resistance lower than the smallest individual resistor in the combination.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option uses a parallel combination, which is the correct type of connection to achieve a low resistance. However, the values of the resistors (40 \u03a9 and 100 \u03a9) are higher than those in option A. The total resistance for resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest individual resistance, but the overall value is still dependent on the magnitudes of the individual resistors.\n\nFor the combination in option B (40 \u03a9 and 100 \u03a9 in parallel):\n1/R_T = 1/40 + 1/100\n1/R_T = 5/200 + 2/200 = 7/200\nR_T = 200/7 \u2248 28.6 \u03a9\n\nWhile this is a low resistance, it is greater than the 13.3 \u03a9 produced by option A. Therefore, it is not the combination that produces the *least* resistance.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option connects the resistors in series. When resistors are connected in series, their individual resistances add up to give the total equivalent resistance (R_T = R\u2081 + R\u2082). This type of connection always results in a total resistance that is greater than any of the individual resistances.\n\nFor the combination in option C (20 \u03a9 and 40 \u03a9 in series):\nR_T = 20 \u03a9 + 40 \u03a9 = 60 \u03a9\n\nThis value is significantly higher than the resistance of a parallel combination and cannot be the least resistance.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option connects the resistors in series.

Adding a resistor in parallel always decreases the total equivalent resistance of the parallel combination. Consequently, the total resistance of the entire circuit (which is the sum of the internal resistance, `r`, and the external equivalent resistance, `R_ext`) decreases.\n    According to Ohm's law for the whole circuit, the total current `I\u2081` is given by `I\u2081 = E / R_total`, where `E` is the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell and `R_total` is the total circuit resistance. Since `R_total` decreases, the total current `I\u2081` drawn from the cell must **increase**.\n\n2.  **Effect on Terminal Potential Difference and Current I\u2082:**\n    The current `I\u2082` flows through the top parallel branch. The potential difference (p.d.) across this branch is equal to the terminal p.d. of the cell, `V_T`. The terminal p.d. is the e.m.f. minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance (the \"lost volts\"), given by the equation: `V_T = E - I\u2081r`.\n    As established, closing the switch causes the total current `I\u2081` to increase. This means the term `I\u2081r` (the lost volts) also increases. As a result, the terminal p.d., `V_T`, across the parallel branches must **decrease**.\n    Applying Ohm's law to the top branch, `I\u2082 = V_T / R\u2082`, where `R\u2082` is the resistance of that branch. Since `V_T` decreases and `R\u2082` is a constant resistance, the current `I\u2082` must **decrease**.\n\nTherefore, closing the switch causes `I\u2081` to increase and `I\u2082` to decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A: decreases, decreases**\n    This is incorrect because the total current `I\u2081` increases. Closing the switch reduces the total circuit resistance, which causes a larger current to be drawn from the source, not a smaller one.\n\n*   **B: decreases, stays the same**\n    This is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, `I\u2081` increases, as explained above. Secondly, `I\u2082` does not stay the same. If the cell were ideal (with zero internal resistance), the terminal p.d. would remain constant at `E`, and `I\u2082` would not change. However, the presence of internal resistance means that an increase in the total current `I\u2081` causes a decrease in the terminal p.d., which in turn causes `I\u2082` to decrease.\n\n*   **D: increases, stays the same**\n    This is incorrect because `I\u2082` does not stay the same. While it correctly identifies that `I\u2081` increases, it fails to account for the effect of the internal resistance. The increase in `I\u2081` leads to a greater voltage drop across the internal resistance (`I\u2081r`), reducing the terminal p.d. available to the external circuit. Since the current `I\u2082` is directly proportional to this terminal p.d.

To find the resistance of R\u2082, we must first determine the potential difference across R\u2082 (V\u2082) and the current through R\u2082 (I\u2082).\n\n1.  **Determine the current through R\u2082 (I\u2082):**\n    According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current entering a junction must equal the total current leaving it. The total current from the cell (0.64 A) splits between the two parallel branches. The current through the bottom branch (containing R\u2083) is given as 0.32 A. Therefore, the current through the top branch (containing R\u2081 and R\u2082 in series) is:\n    I_top = I_total - I_bottom\n    I_top = 0.64 A - 0.32 A = 0.32 A.\n    Since R\u2081 and R\u2082 are in series, the same current flows through both. Thus, I\u2082 = I\u2081 = 0.32 A.\n\n2.  **Determine the potential difference across R\u2082 (V\u2082):**\n    The cell has a negligible internal resistance, so the terminal potential difference across the parallel combination of resistors is equal to the cell's electromotive force (e.m.f.), which is 1.60 V. Components in parallel have the same potential difference across them. Therefore, the total potential difference across the series combination of R\u2081 and R\u2082 is 1.60 V.\n    For resistors in series, the total potential difference is the sum of the individual potential differences:\n    V_top = V\u2081 + V\u2082\n    1.60 V = 0.48 V + V\u2082\n    V\u2082 = 1.60 V - 0.48 V = 1.12 V.\n\n3.  **Calculate the resistance of R\u2082:**\n    Now, using Ohm's Law for R\u2082:\n    R\u2082 = V\u2082 / I\u2082\n    R\u2082 = 1.12 V / 0.32 A\n    R\u2082 = 3.5 \u03a9.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A) 1.5 \u03a9:** This value is the resistance of R\u2081, not R\u2082. It is calculated by dividing the potential difference across R\u2081 (0.48 V) by the current through it (0.32 A): R\u2081 = V\u2081 / I\u2081 = 0.48 V / 0.32 A = 1.5 \u03a9.\n\n*   **B) 2.5 \u03a9:** This value is a result of incorrect calculations. It does not correspond to any valid physical quantity in the circuit based on the given values and circuit laws. For R\u2082 to be 2.5 \u03a9, with a current of 0.32 A, the voltage V\u2082 would need to be 0.8 V (V = IR = 0.32 A \u00d7 2.5 \u03a9), which contradicts the circuit's parameters.\n\n*   **D) 5.0 \u03a9:** This value is the resistance of R\u2083. The potential difference across the R\u2083 branch is equal to the e.m.f. of the cell (1.60 V). Dividing this by the current through R\u2083 (0.32 A) gives R\u2083 = 1.60 V / 0.32 A = 5.0 \u03a9.

This is because no current flows through the galvanometer, so there is no potential drop across the internal resistance of cell E\u2082.\n\nThe potential difference across the wire segment XP is given by V_XP = I \u00d7 R_XP, where I is the current flowing through the primary circuit (from E\u2081) and R_XP is the resistance of the wire segment XP.\n\nThe balance condition is E\u2082 = V_XP.\n\nThe potential gradient along the wire is the potential difference per unit length. A new balance point to the left of P means that the balance length (the length of XP) has decreased. For a shorter length of wire to provide the same potential difference E\u2082, the potential gradient along the wire must have increased.\n\nThe potential gradient is determined by the p.d. across the entire wire XY. This p.d. is given by V_XY = I \u00d7 R_XY, where R_XY is the resistance of the entire wire. The current I in the primary circuit is given by Ohm's law: I = E\u2081 / (R + R_XY), where R is the fixed resistor.\n\nIf R is decreased, the total resistance of the primary circuit (R + R_XY) decreases. According to Ohm's law, this causes the current I in the primary circuit to increase. A larger current I results in a larger potential difference across the wire XY (V_XY = I \u00d7 R_XY) and therefore a larger potential gradient. With a larger potential gradient, a shorter length of wire is required to produce a p.d. equal to E\u2082, so the balance point shifts to the left.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. The wire XY was replaced with one of lower resistance.**\n\nIf the resistance of the wire XY (R_XY) is decreased, the potential difference across it, V_XY, will also decrease. V_XY is the portion of the total e.m.f. E\u2081 that is dropped across the wire, given by the potential divider rule: V_XY = E\u2081 \u00d7 [R_XY / (R + R_XY)]. Decreasing R_XY reduces this fraction, thus lowering V_XY. A lower V_XY means a smaller potential gradient along the wire. To balance the e.m.f. E\u2082, a greater length of the wire would be required, causing the balance point to shift to the right of P.\n\n**B. E\u2082 was increased.**\n\nThe balance condition is E\u2082 = V_XP. If the e.m.f. of the secondary cell, E\u2082, is increased, a larger potential difference from the potentiometer wire is required to balance it. Assuming the primary circuit is unchanged, the potential gradient remains the same. Therefore, a greater length of wire (XP) would be needed to provide this larger potential difference. This would shift the balance point to the right of P.\n\n**C. E\u2081 was decreased.**\n\nIf the e.m.f. of the primary cell, E\u2081, is decreased, the current flowing in the primary circuit (I = E\u2081 / (R + R_XY)) will also decrease. This leads to a smaller potential difference across the wire XY (V_XY = I \u00d7 R_XY) and hence a smaller potential gradient. To balance the same e.m.f. E\u2082, a greater length of the wire would be required.

To find the final nucleus R, we must track the changes in the number of protons and neutrons at each step.\n\n1.  **Initial Nucleus (P):**\n    The problem states that nucleus P has 93 protons and 144 neutrons. This is represented by the coordinates (93, 144) on the graph.\n\n2.  **First Decay: P \u2192 Q (\u03b1-decay)**\n    Nucleus P undergoes alpha (\u03b1) decay to form nucleus Q. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When a nucleus emits an alpha particle, its proton number (atomic number, Z) decreases by 2, and its neutron number (N) also decreases by 2.\n    *   Change in protons: 93 - 2 = 91\n    *   Change in neutrons: 144 - 2 = 142\n    So, the intermediate nucleus Q has 91 protons and 142 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Second Decay: Q \u2192 R (\u03b2\u207b-decay)**\n    Nucleus Q undergoes beta-minus (\u03b2\u207b) decay to form nucleus R. In \u03b2\u207b decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron (the \u03b2\u207b particle) is emitted. This causes the proton number to increase by 1 and the neutron number to decrease by 1.\n    *   Change in protons: 91 + 1 = 92\n    *   Change in neutrons: 142 - 1 = 141\n    Therefore, the final nucleus R has 92 protons and 141 neutrons.\n\nLooking at the graph, point A is located at the coordinates (proton number = 92, number of neutrons = 141). This matches the calculated composition of nucleus R.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nThis point represents a nucleus with 91 protons and 142 neutrons. This is the composition of the intermediate nucleus Q, which is formed after the initial alpha decay from nucleus P. However, the question asks for the final nucleus R, which is formed after nucleus Q undergoes a subsequent beta-minus decay. Thus, point B represents a step in the process but not the final product.\n\n#### C\nThis point represents a nucleus with 94 protons and 143 neutrons. To get from nucleus P (93 protons, 144 neutrons) to this point would require an increase of 1 proton and a decrease of 1 neutron. This corresponds to a single beta-minus decay directly from P. The process described is an alpha decay followed by a beta-minus decay, which results in a different final nucleus.\n\n#### D\nThis point represents a nucleus with 94 protons and 141 neutrons. The decay chain described (one alpha decay and one beta-minus decay) leads to a final nucleus with 92 protons and 141 neutrons (point A). To arrive at point D from the initial nucleus P (93 protons, 144 neutrons) would require a net increase of 1 proton and a net decrease of 3 neutrons, which does not match the specified decay sequence."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_319.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "39 the diagrams show the quark composition of four different hadrons. one of the hadrons is a\n>\" particle. it has a charge of +e, where e is the elementary charge.\nwhich hadron could be the >* particle?\na b cc d\nkey\nu = up quark\n@) g) @) g) \u00a9) (s) \u00a9) g) d = down quark\n@) gs) gs) @) s = strange quark", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe total electric charge of a hadron is determined by the sum of the charges of its constituent quarks.

Identifying the Type of Error**\n\n*   **Random errors** are unpredictable variations in measurements that result in a spread of data points around an average value. They can be caused by factors like fluctuations in reaction time, misreading a scale, or electronic noise. The effect of random errors can be reduced by taking multiple readings and calculating an average.\n*   **Systematic errors** are consistent, repeatable errors that are inherent to the experimental setup, instrument, or procedure. They cause all measurements to be shifted in the same direction from the true value. Averaging multiple readings does not reduce systematic errors. Examples include a zero error on a measuring instrument or neglecting a consistent factor like air resistance.\n\nIn this experiment, the issue arises from using the distance PQ, measured between the electromagnet and the trapdoor, without accounting for the fact that the falling object (the metal ball) has a non-zero diameter. This is a flaw in the experimental procedure, not a random fluctuation. Therefore, it is a **systematic error**. This understanding immediately eliminates options **A** and **B**, which incorrectly classify the error as random.\n\n**2. Determining the Correction**\n\nThe choice between options **C** and **D** depends on whether the measured distance PQ is an overestimate or an underestimate of the true distance the ball falls during the timed interval. This requires a careful interpretation of the experimental process.\n\nThe calculation for the acceleration of free fall, *g*, uses the equation *s = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2*. With the initial velocity *u* = 0, this becomes *g = 2s/t\u00b2*, where *s* is the true distance of fall and *t* is the time of fall.\n\nLet's consider a plausible, though specific, interpretation of the start and stop events for the timer that would lead to option D:\n\n*   **Timer Starts:** Assume the timer is triggered to start not at the instant the ball is released, but when the **bottom** of the ball has cleared the electromagnet at point P.\n*   **Timer Stops:** Assume the timer is triggered to stop not when the bottom of the ball hits the trapdoor, but when the **top** of the ball reaches the level of the trapdoor at point Q.\n\nUnder this specific set of assumptions, the distance travelled by the ball *during the timed interval* can be determined by tracking a single point, for example, the top of the ball.\n*   Initial position of the top of the ball (when the timer starts): The bottom is at P, so the top is a full diameter (*d*) above P. Its position is (P + *d*).\n*   Final position of the top of the ball (when the timer stops): The top is at Q.\n*   True distance fallen, *s*: The displacement of the top of the ball is from (P + *d*) to Q. So, *s* = Q - (P + *d*) = PQ - *d*.\n\nThe student measures the distance between the two pieces of apparatus, which is PQ. To find the correct value for *g*, the student must use the true distance fallen, *s*, in the equation. According to this interpretation, the student must calculate *s* by taking their measured distance PQ and subtracting the diameter of the ball (*d*).\n\nTherefore, the systematic error introduced by using the measured distance PQ instead of the true fall distance *s* can be reduced by subtracting the diameter of the ball from the distance PQ.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n*   **A and B:** The error is systematic, not random. Random errors are unpredictable and are reduced by averaging, not by a fixed correction based on the ball's diameter.\n*   **C:** This option would be correct if the measured distance PQ were an *underestimate* of the true fall distance. This would happen, for instance, if the timer started when the top of the ball was at P and stopped when the bottom of the ball hit Q. In that case, the true distance fallen would be PQ + *d*.

In graphical terms, the acceleration at any given time is equal to the gradient (slope) of the velocity-time graph at that time.\n\n1.  **Interval 0 to P:** The velocity-time graph starts at the origin (v=0, t=0) and curves upwards. The gradient is positive (velocity is increasing) but its value decreases with time (the curve becomes less steep). This signifies an initial maximum positive acceleration that diminishes over time, becoming zero at time P. This occurs as the increasing speed leads to increasing air resistance, which opposes the force of gravity, reducing the net force and thus the acceleration. Graph B correctly shows acceleration starting at a maximum positive value and decreasing to zero at P.\n\n2.  **Interval P to Q:** The velocity-time graph is a horizontal line, indicating that the velocity is constant (this is the first terminal velocity). The gradient of a horizontal line is zero. Therefore, the acceleration of the parachutist is zero during this interval. Graph B correctly shows zero acceleration from P to Q.\n\n3.  **Interval Q to R:** At time Q, the parachute is opened. The velocity-time graph shows a very steep, negative gradient, indicating a rapid decrease in velocity. This corresponds to a large negative acceleration (or deceleration). The magnitude of this deceleration is significantly large because the parachute drastically increases air resistance. As the parachutist slows down, the air resistance decreases, so the magnitude of the negative acceleration also decreases, eventually becoming zero at time R. Graph B accurately represents this with a large negative spike at Q, which then returns to zero at R. The magnitude of this negative acceleration is correctly shown as being greater than the initial positive acceleration.\n\n4.  **Interval R to S:** The velocity-time graph is again a horizontal line, but at a lower velocity value. This represents the new, lower terminal velocity. Since the velocity is constant, the gradient is zero, and thus the acceleration is zero. Graph B correctly shows zero acceleration from R to S.\n\nIn summary, Graph B is the only option that correctly translates the changing gradient of the given velocity-time graph into an acceleration-time graph for all sections of the motion.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A:** This graph correctly shows the general shape of the acceleration changes. However, it incorrectly depicts the magnitude of the deceleration when the parachute opens (at Q). The negative acceleration spike is shown to have a smaller magnitude than the initial acceleration at t=0. Physically, opening a parachute creates a very large drag force, causing a net upward force and a deceleration often much greater in magnitude than the initial acceleration due to gravity (g). Therefore, this graph is quantitatively incorrect.\n\n*   **C:** This graph is incorrect from the beginning. In the interval 0 to P, the parachutist's velocity is increasing, which requires a positive acceleration. This graph incorrectly shows a negative acceleration that increases to zero. An initial negative acceleration would imply the parachutist was initially moving upwards and slowing down, or moving downwards and speeding up in the negative direction, neither of which matches the problem description.\n\n*   **D:** This graph is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, like option C, it incorrectly shows a negative acceleration in the interval 0 to P, whereas the velocity is increasing. Secondly, at time Q, it shows a large positive acceleration. A positive acceleration would mean a rapid increase in velocity, but the velocity-time graph clearly shows a rapid decrease in velocity at Q."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_326.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "6 a projectile is fired from point p with velocity v at an angle @ to the horizontal. it lands at point q,\na horizontal distance r from p, after time t.\npath of projectile\nan na\n0\noes ne. re earnrrele aelhigtiniied\n\nr\nthe acceleration of free fall is g. air resistance is negligible.\nwhich equation is correct?\na r=vtcos@\u00e9\nb r=vtsin@g\nc r=vtcos6-19t?\nd r=vtsino-1gt?", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**A. R = VT cos \u03b8**\n\nThis equation is correct. The motion of a projectile can be analyzed by considering its horizontal and vertical components independently.\n\n1.  **Horizontal Motion:** The initial velocity V has a horizontal component, *V*\u2093, given by *V*\u2093 = *V* cos *\u03b8*. Since air resistance is negligible, there are no forces acting in the horizontal direction. According to Newton's first law, this means there is no horizontal acceleration (*a*\u2093 = 0). The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the flight.\n2.  **Calculating Horizontal Distance (Range):** For motion with constant velocity, the distance travelled is the product of the velocity and the time elapsed. The horizontal distance, or range *R*, is therefore calculated as:\n    Range = Horizontal Velocity \u00d7 Time of Flight\n    *R* = (*V* cos *\u03b8*) \u00d7 *T*\n    *R* = *VT* cos *\u03b8*\n\n### Explanation of Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. R = VT sin \u03b8**\n\nThis equation is incorrect. The term *V* sin *\u03b8* represents the initial *vertical* component of the velocity (*V*\u1d67). The horizontal range *R* is determined by the horizontal component of motion, not the vertical one. This equation incorrectly uses the initial vertical velocity to calculate the horizontal distance.\n\n**C. R = VT cos \u03b8 - \u00bd gT\u00b2**\n\nThis equation is incorrect. It incorrectly combines elements of horizontal and vertical motion. The first term, *VT* cos *\u03b8*, correctly represents the distance that would be covered horizontally with constant velocity *V* cos *\u03b8*. However, the second term, -\u00bd *gT*\u00b2, represents the displacement due to constant vertical acceleration *g*. The acceleration due to gravity, *g*, acts exclusively in the vertical direction. There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction (as air resistance is negligible), so the -\u00bd *gT*\u00b2 term should not be included in the equation for horizontal range.\n\n**D. R = VT sin \u03b8 - \u00bd gT\u00b2**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because it describes the *vertical* displacement of the projectile, not the horizontal range *R*. The equation for vertical displacement (*s*\u1d67) under constant acceleration *g* is *s*\u1d67 = *u*\u1d67*t* + \u00bd *a*\u1d67*t*\u00b2, where *u*\u1d67 is the initial vertical velocity (*V* sin *\u03b8*) and *a*\u1d67 is the vertical acceleration (-*g*). Thus, the vertical displacement after time *T* is *s*\u1d67 = (*V* sin *\u03b8*)*T* - \u00bd *gT*\u00b2.

There are two vertical forces: his weight (W), acting downwards, and the normal reaction force from the floor (R), acting upwards. The man's weight is given by W = mg, where m is his mass and g is the acceleration of free fall.\n\nAccording to Newton's Second Law, the net force on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration (F_net = ma). Since the man is accelerating downwards with acceleration 'a', there must be a net downward force acting on him.\n\nLet's define the downward direction as positive. The net force on the man is the difference between his weight and the upward normal reaction force:\nF_net = W - R\n\nSubstituting F_net = ma and W = mg into the equation:\nma = mg - R\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the normal reaction force, R:\nR = mg - ma\nR = m(g - a)\n\nSince the lift is accelerating downwards, a > 0. Therefore, the term (g - a) is less than g. This means that the normal reaction force (R) is less than the man's weight (mg).\n\nBy Newton's Third Law, the force exerted by the man on the floor is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal reaction force exerted by the floor on the man. Therefore, the force exerted by the man on the floor is also equal to R.\n\nSince R is less than the man's weight (W), the force exerted by the man on the floor is less than his weight.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: It is equal to the weight of the man.**\nThis statement would be true only if the net force on the man were zero. If the force exerted by the man on the floor were equal to his weight, then by Newton's Third Law, the normal reaction force from the floor on the man would also be equal to his weight (R = W). In this case, the net force would be F_net = W - R = 0. According to Newton's Second Law, this would mean the man's acceleration is zero. This contradicts the condition given in the problem, which states that the lift is accelerating.\n\n**B: It is greater than the force exerted by the floor on the man.**\nThis statement violates Newton's Third Law of Motion. The force exerted by the man on the floor and the force exerted by the floor on the man constitute an action-reaction pair.

Specifically, if the change in velocity is calculated by subtracting the magnitudes of the speeds (20 m s\u207b\u00b9 - 10 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 10 m s\u207b\u00b9), rather than accounting for the change in direction. This would lead to an incorrect change in momentum of \u0394p = 0.20 kg * 10 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 2.0 kg m s\u207b\u00b9, and a force of F = 2.0 / 0.10 = 20 N. This is incorrect because momentum is a vector, and the change in direction must be included in the calculation.\n\n**C: 20 kN**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the numerical value of 20 is incorrect, as explained for option A. Secondly, the unit prefix 'k' (kilo) means 1000, making the value 20,000 N. This is a significant overestimation of the force and results from both a calculation error and a unit error.\n\n**D: 60 kN**\nWhile the numerical value of 60 is correct, the unit prefix 'k' (kilo) indicates a force of 60,000 N. This is 1000 times larger than the correctly calculated force. Such an error might arise from a mistake in unit conversion, for instance, by not converting the mass from grams to kilograms and misinterpreting the resulting units.

For a ball falling in a viscous liquid, this occurs when the downward force (weight) is exactly balanced by the sum of the upward forces (upthrust and viscous drag).\n\nThe equation for this equilibrium is:\nWeight = Upthrust + Viscous Drag\n\nLet's analyze the factors that determine these forces:\n*   **Weight (W):** This is the gravitational force on the ball (W = mg). It is determined by the ball's mass, which is a product of its volume (V) and its density (\u03c1_ball). Thus, **W \u221d \u03c1_ball**.\n*   **Upthrust (U):** This is the buoyant force, equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the ball. It is determined by the liquid's density (\u03c1_liquid) and the ball's volume (U = \u03c1_liquid * V * g). Thus, **U \u221d \u03c1_liquid**.\n*   **Viscous Drag (F_d):** This is the resistive force from the liquid. It depends on the liquid's viscosity, the ball's size and shape, and critically, the ball's velocity (v). For a sphere, Stokes' Law gives F_d = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv.\n\nAt terminal velocity (v_t), the equation becomes:\n(\u03c1_ball * V * g) = (\u03c1_liquid * V * g) + F_d(v_t)\n\nFrom this relationship, we can see:\n1.  **The density of the metal of the ball (\u03c1_ball):** Changing the density of the ball changes its weight. A denser ball has a greater weight for the same volume. To re-establish equilibrium, a larger upward viscous drag force is required, which is only achieved at a higher velocity. Therefore, the density of the ball directly affects its terminal velocity.\n3.  **The density of the liquid (\u03c1_liquid):** Changing the density of the liquid changes the upthrust. A denser liquid exerts a greater upthrust. This reduces the net downward force (Weight - Upthrust) that the viscous drag must counteract. To achieve equilibrium with a smaller net downward force, a smaller viscous drag is needed, which occurs at a lower velocity. Therefore, the density of the liquid directly affects the terminal velocity.\n\nSince both the density of the ball and the density of the liquid are fundamental to the force balance that defines terminal velocity, they both affect its value.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **Change 2: The height from which the ball is dropped**\n    This parameter determines the velocity at which the ball *enters* the liquid, but it does not change the value of the terminal velocity itself. Terminal velocity is a characteristic property of the object-fluid system, determined by the balance of forces within the fluid. If the ball enters the liquid at a speed lower than the terminal velocity, it will accelerate until it reaches it. If it enters at a higher speed, it will decelerate. In either case, the final constant velocity it settles at (the terminal velocity) remains the same.\n\n*   **Change 4: The depth of the liquid**\n    This parameter determines *whether* the ball has sufficient distance to reach its terminal velocity before hitting the bottom of the container. It does not, however, affect the *value* of the terminal velocity. The theoretical terminal velocity is determined by the properties of the ball and the liquid, not the dimensions of the container (assuming the container is large enough to neglect wall effects). If the liquid is too shallow, the terminal velocity may not be reached, but its calculated value remains unchanged.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **Option A (1 and 2)** is incorrect because the height of the drop does not affect the terminal velocity.\n*   **Option C (2 and 4)** is incorrect because neither the height of the drop nor the depth of the liquid affects the value of the terminal velocity.\n*   **Option D (3 and 4)** is incorrect because the depth of the liquid does not affect the terminal velocity."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_330.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "10 two objects move towards each other along the same straight line.\nafter colliding, the two objects stick together and are stationary.\nwhich statement must be correct?\na the total kinetic energy of the two objects does not change during the collision.\nb_ the total momentum of the two objects before the collision is zero.\nc_ the two objects have equal mass.\nd_ the two objects have the same speed before the collision.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe principle of conservation of linear momentum states that for a closed system (one with no external forces), the total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.\n\n1.  **Momentum after the collision:** The problem states that after the collision, the two objects stick together and are stationary. This means their final velocity (v_final) is 0 m/s. The total momentum of an object is its mass multiplied by its velocity (p = mv). Therefore, the total momentum of the combined mass after the collision is:\n    p_final = (m\u2081 + m\u2082) \u00d7 v_final = (m\u2081 + m\u2082) \u00d7 0 = 0.\n\n2.  **Momentum before the collision:** According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision (p_initial) must be equal to the total momentum after the collision (p_final).\n    p_initial = p_final\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the total final momentum is zero, the total initial momentum must also have been zero.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The total kinetic energy of the two objects does not change during the collision.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Before the collision, both objects are moving, so each has kinetic energy (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2). The total initial kinetic energy is the sum of their individual kinetic energies and is therefore a positive value. After the collision, the combined object is stationary (v = 0), so the final total kinetic energy is zero. Since the kinetic energy changes from a positive value to zero, it is not conserved. This type of collision, where the objects stick together, is a perfectly inelastic collision, which is defined by the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy is converted into other forms, such as heat and sound.\n\n**C: The two objects have equal mass.**\nThis statement is not necessarily correct. From the correct deduction that the total initial momentum is zero, we can write the equation: p_initial = m\u2081u\u2081 + m\u2082u\u2082 = 0, where m and u represent mass and velocity, respectively. Since the objects move towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions. This leads to the relationship m\u2081u\u2081 = -m\u2082u\u2082. Considering only the magnitudes of the velocities (speeds, s), this becomes m\u2081s\u2081 = m\u2082s\u2082. This equation can be satisfied without the masses being equal. For example, if one object has a mass of 2 kg and a speed of 1 m/s, its momentum has a magnitude of 2 kg\u22c5m/s. The second object could have a mass of 1 kg and a speed of 2 m/s, giving it a momentum of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, resulting in a total initial momentum of zero. Therefore, the masses do not have to be equal.\n\n**D: The two objects have the same speed before the collision.**\nThis statement is not necessarily correct. As derived from the conservation of momentum, the relationship between the masses and speeds of the two objects must be m\u2081s\u2081 = m\u2082s\u2082. This equation shows that the speeds (s\u2081 and s\u2082) are only equal if the masses (m\u2081 and m\u2082) are also equal. As explained for option C, the masses are not necessarily equal. If the masses are different, the speeds must be different in an inverse proportion to ensure the initial momentum is zero.

The radius must be converted to SI units (meters) to be consistent with the units of torque (Newton-meters).\nGiven:\n\u03c4_total = 20 N m\nr = 4.0 cm = 0.040 m\n\nTo find the minimum force F on each side, the formula is rearranged:\nF = \u03c4_total / (2r)\n\nSubstituting the values:\nF = 20 N m / (2 \u00d7 0.040 m)\nF = 20 N m / 0.080 m\nF = 250 N\n\nTherefore, the minimum force that must be applied to each side of the lid is 250 N.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 2.5 N\nThis answer is incorrect because it results from a unit conversion error. The calculation for the force F requires the radius to be in meters to be consistent with the torque given in Newton-meters. This answer is obtained if the radius is incorrectly used as 4.0 cm instead of 0.040 m:\nF = 20 / (2 \u00d7 4.0) = 2.5 N.\nPhysical quantities must be in consistent SI units (meters for distance, Newtons for force, Newton-meters for torque) before being used in calculations.\n\n#### B: 5.0 N\nThis answer is incorrect because it results from two conceptual errors. Firstly, it fails to account for the fact that two forces contribute to the total torque, meaning the formula \u03c4_total = 2Fr should be used, not \u03c4_total = Fr. Secondly, it involves a unit conversion error, using the radius in centimeters instead of meters. The calculation leading to this answer would be:\nF = 20 / 4.0 = 5.0 N.\nThis incorrectly calculates the force as if only one force were acting and as if the radius were 4.0 meters.\n\n#### D: 500 N\nThis answer is incorrect because it fails to account for the torque produced by the second force. The calculation for this value assumes the entire 20 N m of torque is generated by only one of the forces (\u03c4_total = F \u00d7 r), rather than the couple (\u03c4_total = 2Fr).\nUsing the incorrect formula:\nF = \u03c4_total / r = 20 N m / 0.040 m = 500 N.\nSince two forces are acting together, the required force on each side is half of this value."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_332.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "12 auniform bar of length l and weight w rests horizontally on two supports x and y.\nib rx ry\ni 6\nsupport x support y\nww\nsupport x exerts a vertical force rx at a distance of 2 from one end of the bar.\nsupport y exerts a vertical force ry at the other end of the bar.\nthe bar is in equilibrium.\nwhat is the ratio reo\nry\n\na 4 p 2 e 4 p =\n\n2 3 5 5", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nFor the bar to be in static equilibrium, two conditions must be satisfied: the net force must be zero, and the net torque (or moment) about any point must be zero. We can use the principle of moments to find the relationship between the two reaction forces, *R<sub>X</sub>* and *R<sub>Y</sub>*.\n\nThe principle of moments states that for an object in rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any pivot point is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same point.\n\nLet's choose the center of mass of the uniform bar as the pivot point. Since the bar is uniform, its weight *W* acts at its geometric center, which is at a distance of *L*/2 from either end. By choosing the center of mass as the pivot, the moment produced by the weight *W* is zero (as its lever arm is zero), which simplifies the calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify the forces and their lever arms relative to the center of mass (at *L*/2):**\n    *   The support force *R<sub>X</sub>* acts at a distance of *L*/6 from the left end. Its lever arm is the distance from the pivot to the point of application: (*L*/2) - (*L*/6) = (3*L*/6) - (*L*/6) = 2*L*/6 = *L*/3.

This means the object has no linear acceleration.\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The sum of all torques about any point (the resultant torque) must be zero. This means the object has no angular acceleration.\n\nLet's analyze the forces and torques acting on the firework system:\n\n*   **Forces:**\n    *   The weight **W** acts downwards through the pivot.\n    *   The pivot exerts an upward force **R** that is equal and opposite to **W**. Therefore, the net force from **W** and **R** is zero.\n    *   The two rockets exert forces of magnitude **F**. The problem states these forces are in opposite directions. For example, one acts upwards and the other acts downwards. Their vector sum is also zero (F - F = 0).\n    *   Therefore, the total resultant force on the system is zero (R - W + F - F = 0). The condition for translational equilibrium is met.\n\n*   **Torques (Moments) about the pivot:**\n    *   Torque is calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot (Torque = Force \u00d7 distance).\n    *   The forces **W** and **R** act at the pivot, so their distance from the pivot is zero. They produce zero torque.\n    *   The two rocket forces **F** act at a distance **d** from the pivot. Since they are in opposite directions (e.g., one up, one down), they both cause rotation in the same direction (in this case, they would form a couple, causing the rod to spin).\n    *   The total torque is the sum of the torques from each rocket force: Total Torque = (F \u00d7 d) + (F \u00d7 d) = 2Fd.\n    *   Since F and d are non-zero, the resultant torque (2Fd) is not zero. The condition for rotational equilibrium is not met.\n\nBecause the resultant torque is not zero, the firework will experience an angular acceleration and begin to rotate. Therefore, the firework is not in equilibrium. Option D correctly states that the firework is not in equilibrium and provides the correct reason: the resultant torque is not zero.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: The firework is in equilibrium because the resultant force acting on it is zero.**\n    This statement is incorrect. While it is true that the resultant force is zero, this is only one of the two conditions required for equilibrium. Since the resultant torque is non-zero, the object is not in rotational equilibrium and therefore not in overall equilibrium.\n\n*   **B: The firework is in equilibrium because the resultant torque acting on it is zero.**\n    This statement is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, the firework is not in equilibrium. Secondly, the reason provided is false; the two rocket forces create a couple, which produces a non-zero resultant torque (2Fd) about the pivot, causing the firework to rotate.\n\n*   **C: The firework is not in equilibrium because the resultant force acting on it is not zero.**\n    This statement is incorrect because the reason provided is false. The conclusion that the firework is not in equilibrium is correct, but the resultant force *is* zero. The upward pivot force R cancels the downward weight W, and the two oppositely directed rocket forces F cancel each other out.

Address the Contradiction and Calculate the Young Modulus:**\nThe problem states that the unstretched length (L\u2080) is 16.0 cm. This would mean the extension e = L - L\u2080 = 16.0 cm - 16.0 cm = 0. A zero extension under a non-zero force is physically impossible for an elastic cord and would imply an infinite Young modulus. This indicates there is a typographical error in the value given for the unstretched length.\n\nTo find the intended answer, we can work backwards using the correct value for the Young modulus from option C.\n*   Let E = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\n*   Tensile stress, \u03c3 = F / A = 2.265 N / (2.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2) = 1.1325 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\n*   Tensile strain, \u03b5 = \u03c3 / E = (1.1325 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa) / (2.3 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa) \u2248 0.4924.\n*   We also know that strain \u03b5 = (L - L\u2080) / L\u2080.\n*   0.4924 = (0.160 m - L\u2080) / L\u2080\n*   0.4924 \u22c5 L\u2080 = 0.160 - L\u2080\n*   1.4924 \u22c5 L\u2080 = 0.160\n*   L\u2080 = 0.160 / 1.4924 \u2248 0.107 m = 10.7 cm.\n\nThis calculation shows that if the original unstretched length had been 10.7 cm instead of 16.0 cm, the correct Young modulus would be 2.3 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa. This confirms that C is the intended answer despite the error in the problem statement.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n**A: 5.7 \u00d7 10\u2075 Pa**\nThis value is approximately half of the value in option B. An error of a factor of 2 would be required. For instance, if the tension was calculated correctly (F \u2248 2.27 N) and the strain was assumed to be 1.0 (by taking L\u2080 = 8.0 cm), but the stress was incorrectly halved, this might lead to such an answer. This would involve multiple conceptual errors.\n\n**B: 1.1 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa**\nThis answer is obtained if one assumes the contradictory information in the text (L\u2080 = 16.0 cm) is incorrect and instead assumes the unstretched length (L\u2080) is 8.0 cm.\n*   Under this assumption, the extension e = L - L\u2080 = 16.0 cm - 8.0 cm = 8.0 cm.\n*   The strain \u03b5 = e / L\u2080 = 8.0 cm / 8.0 cm = 1.0.\n*   The stress \u03c3 = F / A = 2.265 N / (2.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2) = 1.13 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\n*   The Young modulus E = \u03c3 / \u03b5 = (1.13 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa) / 1.0 = 1.13 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\nWhile this calculation is arithmetically sound based on the assumption L\u2080 = 8.0 cm, it ignores the explicit value for L\u2080 given in the problem's text.\n\n**D: 3.9 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa**\nThis answer would likely result from making multiple errors. For example, if one were to incorrectly assume that the tension in the cord is equal to the full weight of the load (F = W = 3.924 N) and also used the intended strain of approximately 0.5 (which arises from an unstretched length of about 10.7 cm).\n*   Incorrect stress: \u03c3 = F / A = 3.924 N / (2.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2) = 1.962 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\n*   Young's modulus: E = \u03c3 / \u03b5 = (1.962 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa) / 0.5 \u2248 3.9 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\nThis path relies on two significant conceptual errors in physics."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_339.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "19 which force\u2014extension graph shows plastic deformation of a sample of material?\na b\nforce force\na l.\n0 extension 0 extension\ncc d\nforce force\nez va\n0 extension 0 extension", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Option\n\nThis graph accurately illustrates plastic deformation. The process begins with the material being stretched, as indicated by the initial upward curve. During this loading phase, the material first undergoes elastic deformation (the initial straight-line portion where Hooke's law is obeyed) and is then stretched beyond its elastic limit. The crucial part of the graph is the unloading phase. As the force is decreased, the material contracts, but it does not return along the original path. When the force is completely removed (F=0), the extension does not return to zero. The material is left with a permanent extension, which is the defining characteristic of plastic deformation.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**A**\nThis graph shows a linear relationship between force and extension, passing through the origin. This represents a material that obeys Hooke's Law. Behaviour described by Hooke's Law is characteristic of elastic deformation, where the material returns to its original length after the force is removed. The graph only shows the loading phase within the elastic region and does not depict any permanent deformation, which is a necessary feature of plasticity.\n\n**B**\nThis graph shows a non-linear relationship between force and extension during loading. While this indicates the material does not obey Hooke's law beyond a certain point, the graph only depicts the application of the force (loading). It does not show what happens when the force is removed (unloading). Without the unloading curve, it is impossible to determine if the deformation is elastic (returns to the origin) or plastic (results in permanent extension). Therefore, this graph does not provide sufficient information to show plastic deformation.\n\n**C**\nThis graph illustrates a loading and unloading cycle where the material returns to its original length (zero extension) when the force is removed. The fact that the unloading path is different from the loading path forms a loop, which indicates that energy has been dissipated as heat during the cycle. This phenomenon is known as elastic hysteresis. However, because the material ultimately returns to its original dimensions, the deformation is elastic, not plastic.

It can be calculated using the time lag (\u0394t) between the waves and their common period (T).\n\n1.  **Determine the Period (T):** The period is the time taken for one complete oscillation. For the wave starting at the origin (s=0, t=0), one full cycle is completed when it returns to s=0 with a positive slope. From the graph, this occurs at t = 8 s. Thus, the period T = 8 s. We can verify this with the other wave: its trough is at t=3 s and its peak is at t=7 s. The time for half a cycle is 7 s - 3 s = 4 s, so the full period is T = 2 \u00d7 4 s = 8 s.\n\n2.  **Determine the Time Lag (\u0394t):** The time lag is the time difference between corresponding points on the two waves. A simpler, though less rigorous, method often used is to find the time difference between the first zero-crossings of each wave. The first wave crosses the time axis at t = 0 s. The second wave crosses the time axis at t = 1 s. Taking the difference gives a time lag of \u0394t = 1 s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Phase Difference (\u03c6):** The relationship between phase difference, time lag, and period is given by the formula:\n    \u03c6 = (\u0394t / T) \u00d7 360\u00b0\n\n    Substituting the values:\n    \u03c6 = (1 s / 8 s) \u00d7 360\u00b0\n    \u03c6 = (1/8) \u00d7 360\u00b0\n    \u03c6 = 45\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the phase difference between the two waves is 45\u00b0.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. 0\u00b0**\n\nA phase difference of 0\u00b0 would mean the two waves are 'in phase'. This implies that their peaks, troughs, and zero-crossings would all occur at the same moments in time. The graph clearly shows that the two waves are shifted relative to one another; for instance, one wave starts at zero displacement while the other starts at a positive displacement. Thus, they are not in phase.\n\n**C. 90\u00b0**\n\nA phase difference of 90\u00b0 (or \u03c0/2 radians) is also known as being in 'quadrature'. This corresponds to a time lag of one-quarter of a period (\u0394t = T/4). Since the period is T = 8 s, a 90\u00b0 phase difference would require a time lag of \u0394t = 8 s / 4 = 2 s. This would mean, for example, that the peak of one wave aligns with the zero-crossing of the other. The wave starting at the origin has its peak at t = 2 s. At this time, the other wave is not at a zero-crossing (its zero-crossings are at t=1 s and t=5 s). Therefore, the phase difference is not 90\u00b0.\n\n**D. 180\u00b0**\n\nA phase difference of 180\u00b0 (or \u03c0 radians) means the waves are in 'antiphase'. This would mean that the peak of one wave occurs at the same time as the trough of the other. On the graph, the wave starting at the origin has a peak at t = 2 s. The other wave is not at a trough at t = 2 s; its trough occurs at t = 3 s.

This property is exclusive to transverse waves.\n*   **Longitudinal waves contain compressions and rarefactions:** In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of energy transfer.

This is the characteristic structure of a longitudinal wave, such as a sound wave.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:**\nThe property listed for transverse waves is incorrect. Compressions and rarefactions are characteristic of longitudinal waves. Transverse waves are characterised by crests and troughs, which are points of maximum positive and negative displacement, respectively. Furthermore, the property listed for longitudinal waves is also incorrect; as mechanical waves, they require a medium to propagate and cannot travel in a vacuum.\n\n**C:**\nWhile the description for transverse waves is correct (it is their definition), the statement for longitudinal waves is incorrect.

According to the Doppler effect, if the sound source moves away from the observer, the observed frequency will be lower than the source frequency.

The direction is incorrect because moving away from the observer would result in a lower observed frequency, whereas the observed frequency is higher.

On the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared (IR) radiation is located before visible light when ordered by increasing frequency.

The resulting equation for the displacement `y` at a position `x` and time `t` can be represented as `y(x, t) = (2A sin(kx)) cos(\u03c9t)`.\n\nIn this equation, the term `(2A sin(kx))` represents the amplitude of oscillation at a specific position `x`, while the term `cos(\u03c9t)` describes the oscillation in time for all points on the string.\n\nAll points on the string (except for the nodes, where the amplitude is always zero) oscillate in simple harmonic motion with the same angular frequency `\u03c9`. A key characteristic of this collective motion is that all oscillating points pass through their equilibrium position (`y = 0`) at the same instants. This occurs when the time-dependent part of the equation is zero, i.e., when `cos(\u03c9t) = 0`. This condition is met twice during each period of oscillation. At these specific times, the displacement of every point along the string is zero, causing the entire string to become momentarily horizontal.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. Each point on the string between two antinodes has an oscillation of the same amplitude.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining feature of a stationary wave, which distinguishes it from a progressive wave, is that the amplitude of oscillation varies with position along the string. The amplitude is zero at points called nodes and reaches a maximum value at points called antinodes. For any segment of the string, such as the one between two antinodes, the amplitude of oscillation is different for each point. The amplitude is maximum at the antinodes and decreases to zero at the node located midway between them.\n\n**C. The number of nodes is equal to the number of antinodes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for a string fixed at both ends. Since the string is fixed, its ends cannot oscillate and must therefore be nodes.\n*   In the fundamental mode (first harmonic), the string has one loop, with two nodes (at the ends) and one antinode in the middle.\n*   In the second harmonic, there are two loops, resulting in three nodes and two antinodes.\n*   In the third harmonic, there are three loops, resulting in four nodes and three antinodes.\nFor any mode of vibration `n` on a string fixed at both ends, there will always be `n+1` nodes and `n` antinodes. Therefore, the number of nodes is always one greater than the number of antinodes.\n\n**D. Two adjacent antinodes oscillate in phase.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The phase of oscillation is constant for all points within a single loop (i.e., between two adjacent nodes), but it is opposite for points in adjacent loops. This means that all points in one loop move in the same direction at any given time, while the points in the neighbouring loop move in the opposite direction. Since adjacent antinodes are the points of maximum displacement in adjacent loops, they are always moving in opposite directions.

The boundary conditions for such a pipe require a displacement node (a point of minimum displacement) at the closed end and a displacement antinode (a point of maximum displacement) at the open end.\n\nThe simplest standing wave pattern that satisfies these conditions is one where the length of the pipe, *L*, is equal to one-quarter of the wavelength, *\u03bb*.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n*L* = *\u03bb* / 4\n\nFrom this, we can determine the wavelength of the fundamental frequency:\n*\u03bb* = 4 * *L*\n\nGiven that the length of the pipe *L* = 10 m:\n*\u03bb* = 4 * 10 m = 40 m\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (*v*), frequency (*f*), and wavelength (*\u03bb*) is given by the wave equation:\n*v* = *f* *\u03bb*\n\nTo find the frequency, we rearrange the equation:\n*f* = *v* / *\u03bb*\n\nSubstituting the given speed of sound *v* = 320 m s\u207b\u00b9 and the calculated wavelength *\u03bb* = 40 m:\n*f* = 320 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 40 m = 8 Hz\n\nTherefore, the lowest frequency of sound produced by the pipe is 8 Hz.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. 4 Hz**\nA frequency of 4 Hz would correspond to a wavelength of *\u03bb* = *v* / *f* = 320 / 4 = 80 m. For a standing wave to form in a pipe closed at one end, its length *L* must be related to the wavelength *\u03bb* by the formula *L* = *n\u03bb*/4, where *n* is an odd integer (1, 3, 5, ...). In this case, 10 m = *n* * (80 m) / 4, which gives *n* = 0.5. Since *n* must be an odd integer, a frequency of 4 Hz is not a resonant frequency for this pipe. This answer might result from a calculation error, such as dividing the correct answer by two.\n\n**C. 16 Hz**\nThis frequency is incorrect because it represents the fundamental frequency for a pipe that is **open at both ends**. For a pipe open at both ends, the fundamental mode has antinodes at both ends, meaning the length of the pipe is equal to half a wavelength (*L* = *\u03bb*/2). For a 10 m pipe, this would give a wavelength of *\u03bb* = 2 * *L* = 20 m, and a frequency of *f* = *v* / *\u03bb* = 320 / 20 = 16 Hz. This calculation incorrectly applies the boundary conditions for an open-open pipe to the given closed-open pipe scenario.\n\n**D. 32 Hz**\nThis frequency corresponds to a wavelength of *\u03bb* = *v* / *f* = 320 / 32 = 10 m. For a standing wave to be produced in the given closed-open pipe, the condition *L* = *n\u03bb*/4 must be met, where *n* is an odd integer. Substituting the values, we get 10 m = *n* * (10 m) / 4, which yields *n* = 4. Since *n* is not an odd integer, 32 Hz is not a resonant frequency for this pipe. This frequency would, however, be the first overtone (or second harmonic) for a pipe of the same length that is open at both ends (*L* = *\u03bb*)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_347.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "27 |n an experiment, water waves in a ripple tank are incident on a gap, as shown.\na\n\u2014-\nal\nsome diffraction of the water waves is observed.\nwhich change to the experiment would provide a better demonstration of diffraction?\na increase the amplitude of the waves.\nb_ increase the frequency of the waves.\nc_ increase the wavelength of the waves.\nd increase the width of the gap.", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C. Increase the wavelength of the waves.**\n\nDiffraction is the phenomenon where waves spread out as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. The extent to which the waves diffract is determined by the ratio of the wavelength (\u03bb) to the size of the aperture (a).\n\nSignificant diffraction occurs when the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the width of the gap (i.e., the ratio \u03bb/a is close to or greater than 1). To achieve a *better* or more pronounced demonstration of diffraction, the amount of spreading must be increased. This is accomplished by increasing the ratio \u03bb/a.\n\nBy increasing the wavelength of the waves while keeping the gap width constant, the ratio \u03bb/a increases. This causes the waves to spread out over a wider angle after passing through the gap, making the diffraction effect more noticeable and thus providing a better demonstration.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Increase the amplitude of the waves.**\n\nThe amplitude of a wave is related to its energy or intensity, not to its diffraction characteristics. Increasing the amplitude would make the water waves higher (and the troughs deeper), but it would not change the angle through which the waves spread out after passing through the gap. The geometric pattern of diffraction is independent of the wave's amplitude. Therefore, this change would not provide a better demonstration of the diffraction phenomenon itself.\n\n**B. Increase the frequency of the waves.**\n\nThe speed of a wave (v), its frequency (f), and its wavelength (\u03bb) are related by the wave equation: v = f\u03bb. For water waves in a ripple tank, the wave speed is determined by the properties of the medium (primarily the depth of the water) and can be considered constant. According to the equation, if the frequency (f) is increased while the speed (v) remains constant, the wavelength (\u03bb) must decrease. A decrease in wavelength would decrease the ratio \u03bb/a, leading to *less* diffraction. The waves would spread out less, making the effect less prominent.\n\n**D. Increase the width of the gap.**\n\nThe degree of diffraction depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the gap width (\u03bb/a). If the width of the gap (a) is increased while the wavelength (\u03bb) remains constant, the ratio \u03bb/a decreases. As this ratio becomes smaller, the diffraction effect becomes less significant. The waves will pass through the wider gap with minimal spreading, behaving more like a beam and showing less of the characteristic wave-spreading property of diffraction. This would result in a *poorer* demonstration of diffraction."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_348.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "28 light of wavelength 2 is emitted from two point sources r and s and falls onto a distant screen.\nscreen\nre not to\nscale\np\nse\nat point p on the screen, the light intensity is zero.\nwhat could explain the zero intensity at p?\na light from the two sources is emitted 180\u00b0 out of phase and the path difference to p is 32.\nb light from the two sources is emitted in phase and the path difference to p is 2.\nc light from the two sources is emitted 90\u00b0 out of phase and the path difference to p is 1.\nd light from the two sources is emitted in phase and the path difference to pis 32.", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**D.

A filament is made of a metallic conductor (typically tungsten), and the resistance of metals increases as their temperature increases.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Voltage, Current, and Power:** When a potential difference (p.d.), V, is applied across the filament lamp, a current, I, flows through it. The electrical power dissipated in the filament is given by the formula P = VI.

This leads to a greater power dissipation (P) in the filament, causing its temperature to rise significantly.\n\n3.  **Temperature and Resistance:** For a metallic conductor like the filament, an increase in temperature causes the metal ions in the lattice to vibrate with greater amplitude.

If A is incorrectly calculated as A = r\u00b2, instead of A = \u03c0r\u00b2, the resistivity would be calculated as \u03c1 = Rr\u00b2/L = (20 \u00d7 (0.010)\u00b2)/0.060 \u2248 0.033 \u03a9 m.

Therefore, the e.m.f. is the total electrical energy provided by the source per unit of charge that passes through it. This definition is always true, regardless of whether the cell is in an open or closed circuit. The S.I. unit for e.m.f. is the volt (V), which is equivalent to a joule per coulomb (J C\u207b\u00b9).\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A. The e.m.f. is the energy converted from electrical to other forms in the cell.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes the opposite energy conversion process. The e.m.f. is the energy converted *to* electrical form from another form (e.g., chemical). The conversion of electrical energy *to* other forms (primarily heat) within the cell is due to the cell's internal resistance. This dissipated energy is often referred to as \"lost volts\" and represents an energy loss, not the total energy supplied by the cell.\n\n**C.

When a current (I) is drawn from the cell, some potential is \"lost\" across the cell's internal resistance (r). The relationship is given by V = \u03b5 - Ir. The terminal potential difference is only equal to the e.m.f. (\u03b5) under the specific condition that no current is flowing (I = 0), which occurs in an open circuit.

They are derived from two of the most basic conservation laws in physics: the conservation of charge and the conservation of energy.\n\n*   **Kirchhoff's First Law (The Junction Rule):** This law states that the sum of the currents entering a junction (a point where multiple wires meet) is equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction. Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge. Therefore, this law is a direct application of the **principle of conservation of charge**. It ensures that charge does not accumulate at or disappear from any point in the circuit; the amount of charge flowing into a junction per unit time must be the same as the amount flowing out.\n\n*   **Kirchhoff's Second Law (The Loop Rule):** This law states that for any closed loop in a circuit, the algebraic sum of the electromotive forces (e.m.f.s) is equal to the algebraic sum of the potential drops (p.d.s) across the components. An e.m.f. represents the energy supplied to each unit of charge by a source (like a battery), while a potential drop represents the energy converted or dissipated by each unit of charge as it passes through a component (like a resistor). Thus, this law is an expression of the **principle of conservation of energy**. It signifies that the total energy gained by a unit of charge from the sources in a loop must equal the total energy it loses in the components of that same loop.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n*   **charge and resistance:** While Kirchhoff's first law is based on the conservation of charge, his second law is not based on the conservation of resistance. Resistance is a property of a material that describes its opposition to current flow and results in energy dissipation. It is not a fundamental conserved quantity in the context of circuit laws.\n*   **mass and energy:** While Kirchhoff's second law is based on the conservation of energy, the first law is based on the conservation of charge, not mass. Although charge carriers (like electrons) have mass, the principle governing their flow in a circuit is the conservation of their collective charge, not their mass.\n*   **mass and resistance:** Neither of these quantities forms the basis for Kirchhoff's laws.

The e.m.f. of the cell, `E`, is the total energy supplied to each unit of charge.\n2.  As the current `I` flows through the circuit, there are potential drops across the resistors.\n3.  The potential drop across the external resistor `R` is given by `V_R = IR`.\n4.  The potential drop across the internal resistance `r` (also known as \"lost volts\") is `V_r = Ir`.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the total e.m.f. must equal the sum of all potential drops in the circuit:\n`E = IR + Ir`\n\nBy subtracting `Ir` from both sides, we can rearrange this equation to:\n`E - Ir = IR`\n\nThis shows that the terminal potential difference across the cell (`E - Ir`) is equal to the potential difference across the external resistor (`IR`).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### B: `E = Ir - IR`\nThis equation incorrectly relates the e.m.f. to the difference between the potential drops. According to the principle of conservation of energy (as applied by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law), the total energy supplied by the source (`E`) must be equal to the sum of the energy dissipated in the internal resistance (`Ir`) and the external resistance (`IR`). This equation violates this principle by subtracting the potential drops.\n\n#### C: `E + Ir = IR`\nThis equation can be rearranged to `E = IR - Ir`. This is incorrect because it implies that the e.m.f. is less than the potential difference across the external resistor. The potential drop across the internal resistance (`Ir`) represents energy lost within the power source, so it reduces the potential difference available to the external circuit. Therefore, the term `Ir` should be added to `IR` to equal the total e.m.f. `E`, not subtracted from it.\n\n#### D: `E = IR`\nThis equation is a form of Ohm's Law that would only be correct for a circuit with an ideal cell, meaning a cell with zero internal resistance (`r = 0`). Since the circuit contains an internal resistance `r`, this resistance must be included when calculating the total resistance of the circuit. The correct application of Ohm's Law to the entire circuit is `E = I(R + r)`, which expands to `E = IR + Ir`.

The value of Vout is determined by the potential divider formula:\n\nVout = Vin \u00d7 (R\u2081 / (R\u2081 + R\u2082))\n\nTo increase the value of Vout, the ratio R\u2081 / (R\u2081 + R\u2082) must be increased. This can be achieved by increasing the numerator (R\u2081) or by decreasing the denominator (R\u2081 + R\u2082). Decreasing the denominator is primarily achieved by decreasing R\u2082.\n\nIn the case of option **B**, R\u2081 is doubled and R\u2082 is halved.\n*   Increasing R\u2081 makes the numerator larger.\n*   Decreasing R\u2082 makes the denominator smaller.\n\nBoth of these changes contribute to making the fraction R\u2081 / (R\u2081 + R\u2082) larger.

This is the opposite of the desired outcome.\n\n#### Option D: R\u2081 is halved and R\u2082 is halved\n\nIf both R\u2081 and R\u2082 are halved, the new resistances are R\u2081/2 and R\u2082/2. The new output voltage, Vout', is:\n\nVout' = Vin \u00d7 ((R\u2081/2) / ((R\u2081/2) + (R\u2082/2)))\nVout' = Vin \u00d7 ((R\u2081/2) / (1/2)(R\u2081 + R\u2082))\nVout' = Vin \u00d7 (R\u2081 / (R\u2081 + R\u2082)) = Vout\n\nThe ratio of the resistances remains unchanged, so the output voltage Vout does not change."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_358.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "38 two alpha-particles with the same kinetic energy are moving towards, and are then deflected by,\na gold nucleus.\ngold nucleus\nalpha-particles \\\nas\nwhich diagram could show the paths of the two alpha-particles?\na b\n@\n\u2014_\n\u00a9 \u2014\\\ncc d\n@\n_ 3\nfe", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThis diagram accurately represents the scattering of alpha-particles by a nucleus.

The electrostatic repulsive force between the alpha-particle and the nucleus increases significantly as the distance between them decreases.

Therefore, 10 m s\u207b\u00b9 is a reasonable estimate for a container ship's maximum speed.\n\n**C. racing car: 9000 cm s\u207b\u00b9**\nFirst, convert the speed to metres per second (m s\u207b\u00b9):\n9000 cm s\u207b\u00b9 = 9000 / 100 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 90 m s\u207b\u00b9\nTo better assess this value, convert it to kilometres per hour (km h\u207b\u00b9):\n90 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 90 \u00d7 3.6 km h\u207b\u00b9 = 324 km h\u207b\u00b9\nHigh-performance racing cars, such as those in Formula 1, can reach maximum speeds well over 300 km h\u207b\u00b9. Thus, an estimate of 324 km h\u207b\u00b9 is perfectly reasonable for a racing car.\n\n**D. snail: 0.01 km h\u207b\u00b9**\nThis speed is very low, as expected for a snail. To evaluate it, we can convert it to more suitable units, like millimetres per second (mm s\u207b\u00b9):\n0.01 km h\u207b\u00b9 = (0.01 \u00d7 1000) m / 3600 s = 10 m / 3600 s \u2248 0.0028 m s\u207b\u00b9\nConverting to millimetres per second:\n0.0028 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 2.8 mm s\u207b\u00b9\nA typical garden snail moves at a speed of a few millimetres per second. Therefore, an estimate of 0.01 km h\u207b\u00b9 is a reasonable value for the maximum speed of a snail."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_362.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 which quantity is an si base quantity?\na force\nb- newton\nc second\nd_ time", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe International System of Units (SI) is founded upon seven fundamental physical quantities, known as **base quantities**.

Mass is an SI base quantity, but acceleration is itself a derived quantity (change in velocity / time). Velocity is also derived (distance / time).

Crucially, because the time variable (t) is squared in the formula for acceleration (a = 2s/t\u00b2), its fractional uncertainty must be multiplied by 2.\n    Correct calculation: \u0394a/a = \u0394s/s + 2(\u0394t/t) \u2248 (0.1/16.5) + 2(1.0/15.0) \u2248 0.139.

According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object moving at a constant velocity (which includes constant speed in a straight line) is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. This means the net force acting on the object is zero.\n\nTo analyze the forces, it is convenient to resolve them into components parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion. The direction of motion is at an angle \u03b8 to the horizontal.\n\n1.  **Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion:**\n    *   The lift force (L) acts upwards, perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n    *   The weight (W) acts vertically downwards. We need to find the component of the weight that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion. By resolving the weight vector, this component is found to be W cos \u03b8.\n    *   For the net force in this perpendicular direction to be zero, the upward force must balance the downward force:\n        *   L = W cos \u03b8\n\n2.  **Forces parallel to the direction of motion:**\n    *   The thrust force (T) acts forward, in the direction of motion.\n    *   The resistive force (R) acts backward, opposing the motion.\n    *   The component of the weight (W) that acts parallel to the direction of motion also opposes the forward motion (it acts down the slope). This component is W sin \u03b8.\n    *   For the net force in this parallel direction to be zero, the total forward force must balance the total backward force:\n        *   T = R + W sin \u03b8\n\nBoth of these derived equations match the equations presented in option A.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (B)\n\nThis option incorrectly resolves the components of the weight vector.\n*   The equation **L = W sin \u03b8** is incorrect. The lift force (L) acts perpendicular to the direction of motion. It must balance the component of the weight that is also perpendicular to the direction of motion. This component is correctly given by W cos \u03b8.\n*   The equation **T = R + W cos \u03b8** is also incorrect. The thrust (T) acts parallel to the direction of motion. It must balance the resistive force (R) and the component of weight parallel to the motion. This weight component is correctly given by W sin \u03b8.\nTherefore, this option uses the wrong trigonometric functions for both components of the weight.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (C)\n\nThis option correctly resolves the forces perpendicular to the motion but incorrectly formulates the equation for the forces parallel to the motion.\n*   The equation **L = W cos \u03b8** is correct, as explained for the correct answer A.\n*   However, the equation **T = R - W sin \u03b8** is incorrect. The thrust (T) acts in the forward direction of motion. Both the resistive force (R) and the component of weight parallel to the motion (W sin \u03b8) act in the opposite direction, opposing the thrust. For the aeroplane to be in equilibrium, the forward force must equal the sum of the backward forces. The correct relationship is T = R + W sin \u03b8. Subtracting the weight component implies it assists the thrust, which is physically incorrect in this scenario.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (D)\n\nThis option contains two errors, combining the mistakes from options B and C.\n*   First, it incorrectly resolves the weight vector's components, similar to option B. The equation **L = W sin \u03b8** is incorrect; the correct relationship is L = W cos \u03b8.\n*   Second, it incorrectly formulates the equilibrium equation for forces parallel to the motion, similar to option C. The equation **T = R - W cos \u03b8** is incorrect for two reasons: it uses the wrong trigonometric function (cos \u03b8 instead of sin \u03b8) for the weight component, and it incorrectly subtracts this component instead of adding it to the resistive force R.

The term \"rate of change\" indicates how much the velocity changes per unit of time. This can be a change in speed, a change in direction, or both, as velocity is a vector quantity. The standard formula for average acceleration is a = \u0394v / \u0394t, where \u0394v is the change in velocity and \u0394t is the time interval over which the change occurs.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. the rate of change of displacement**\nThis is the definition of velocity. Velocity describes how an object's position (displacement) changes over time. It is calculated as v = \u0394s / \u0394t, where \u0394s is the change in displacement. Acceleration is the rate of change of this velocity, not the rate of change of displacement.\n\n**B. the rate of change of kinetic energy**\nThis is the definition of power. Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. According to the work-energy theorem, the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy (W = \u0394KE). Therefore, power (P) is the rate at which kinetic energy changes: P = \u0394KE / \u0394t. While acceleration leads to a change in kinetic energy, the rate of this change is power, not acceleration.\n\n**C. the rate of change of momentum**\nThis is the definition of the resultant (or net) force acting on an object, as stated by Newton's Second Law of Motion. Momentum (p) is the product of mass and velocity (p = mv). Newton's Second Law can be expressed as F_net = \u0394p / \u0394t. Since a = \u0394v/\u0394t, for a constant mass, F_net = m(\u0394v/\u0394t) = ma.

It states that the resultant force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate of change of its momentum, and this change in momentum occurs in the direction of the force. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n*   **F = \u0394p / \u0394t**\n\nWhere:\n*   **F** is the resultant force.\n*   **\u0394p** is the change in momentum.\n*   **\u0394t** is the change in time.\n\nMomentum (**p**) is the product of an object's mass (**m**) and velocity (**v**), so **p = mv**. Therefore, the change in momentum is **\u0394p = \u0394(mv)**. For an object with constant mass, this simplifies to **\u0394p = m\u0394v**.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for force:\n\n*   **F = m(\u0394v / \u0394t)**\n\nSince acceleration (**a**) is defined as the rate of change of velocity (**a = \u0394v / \u0394t**), the equation becomes the more familiar form **F = ma**.\n\nTherefore, the resultant force is fundamentally equal to the change in momentum of the object per unit time.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the acceleration of the object per unit mass**\nThis statement describes the quantity **a / m**. According to Newton's Second Law, **F = ma**. If we rearrange this equation to find **a / m**, we get **a / m = F / m\u00b2**. This is not equal to the resultant force **F**.\n\n**B: the change in kinetic energy of the object per unit time**\nThe change in kinetic energy of an object per unit time (**\u0394E\u2096 / \u0394t**) is the definition of power, not force. According to the work-energy theorem, the work done (**W**) on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy (**W = \u0394E\u2096**). Power (**P**) is the rate at which work is done (**P = W / \u0394t**). Since **W = Fd** (force times distance), power can also be expressed as **P = Fv** (force times velocity). Power and force are different physical quantities.\n\n**D: the change in velocity of the object per unit time**\nThe change in velocity per unit time (**\u0394v / \u0394t**) is the definition of acceleration (**a**). While the resultant force is directly proportional to the acceleration (**F \u221d a**), they are not equal. The mass of the object is the constant of proportionality, as given by Newton's Second Law, **F = ma**. Thus, the resultant force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, not just acceleration alone."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_369.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "9 an object falls from a stationary helicopter and reaches terminal velocity.\nwhat happens to the acceleration of the object between leaving the helicopter and reaching\nterminal velocity?\na_ it decreases to 9.81ms\u201d.\nb_ it decreases to zero.\nc itincreases to 9.81ms\u201d.\nd_ it remains constant at 9.81 ms\u201d.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nWhen an object falls from rest, two primary vertical forces act upon it:\n1.  **Weight (W):** The force of gravity acting downwards. This force is constant and is calculated as the product of the object's mass (m) and the acceleration due to gravity (g), so W = mg.\n2.  **Air Resistance (R):** A drag force acting upwards, opposing the motion. This force is not constant; it increases as the speed of the object increases.\n\n**Analysis of the motion:**\n\n*   **Initial State (t=0):** At the moment the object is released, its speed is zero. Therefore, the force of air resistance is also zero. The only force acting on the object is its weight. The net force is F_net = W = mg. According to Newton's Second Law (F_net = ma), the initial acceleration of the object is a = mg/m = g, which is 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2.\n\n*   **During the fall:** As the object falls, it gains speed. The increasing speed causes the upward force of air resistance (R) to increase. The net downward force on the object is the difference between its weight and the air resistance: F_net = W - R. Since R is increasing, the net force is decreasing. Consequently, the acceleration (a = F_net/m) also decreases.\n\n*   **Terminal Velocity:** The object continues to accelerate, but at a progressively smaller rate. Eventually, its speed becomes high enough that the upward force of air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the downward force of weight (R = W). At this point, the net force on the object is zero (F_net = W - R = 0). According to Newton's Second Law, if the net force is zero, the acceleration must also be zero. The object stops accelerating and falls at a constant maximum velocity, known as terminal velocity.\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the object decreases from its initial value of 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 to zero when it reaches terminal velocity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: It decreases to 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2.**\nThis is incorrect. The acceleration *starts* at 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 (the acceleration due to gravity, g) because the initial velocity and thus initial air resistance are zero. As the object falls, air resistance increases, causing the net force and acceleration to decrease *from* 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2, not *to* it.\n\n**C: It increases to 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2.**\nThis is incorrect. The acceleration is at its maximum value of 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 at the very beginning of the fall. As the object's speed increases, the opposing force of air resistance also increases. This reduces the net downward force, which in turn causes the acceleration to decrease, not increase.\n\n**D: It remains constant at 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2.**\nThis would only be true if the object were falling in a vacuum, where there is no air resistance. In a vacuum, the only force acting on the object would be its weight, resulting in a constant acceleration of g. However, the problem states that the object reaches terminal velocity, which is a phenomenon caused by the presence of air resistance balancing the force of gravity. Therefore, air resistance cannot be ignored, and the acceleration is not constant."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_370.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "10 two balls, of masses m and 2m, travelling in a vacuum with initial velocities 2v and v\nrespectively, collide with each other head-on, as shown.\n(m)}\u2014- 2v v \u2014(e\")\nafter the collision, the ball of mass m rebounds to the left with velocity v.\nwhat is the loss of kinetic energy in the collision?\na 3mv b 3m/ cc 3mvv d &mvv", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe loss of kinetic energy in a collision is the difference between the total kinetic energy of the system before the collision and the total kinetic energy after the collision.

The force is `F`.\n2.  **Determine the angle:** The lever arm (handle) is horizontal. The force `F` is applied at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the vertical. The angle between the horizontal handle and the vertical is 90\u00b0. Therefore, the angle between the force vector `F` and the handle is 90\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 = 45\u00b0.\n3.  **Find the perpendicular component of the force:** The component of the force `F` that is perpendicular to the handle is given by `F_\u22a5 = F sin(\u03b8)`, where `\u03b8` is the angle between the force and the lever arm.\n    `F_\u22a5 = F sin(45\u00b0)`\n4.  **Calculate the moment:** Substitute the values into the moment formula:\n    \u03c4 = d \u00d7 F_\u22a5\n    \u03c4 = d \u00d7 F sin(45\u00b0)\n5.  **Evaluate the trigonometric function:** The value of sin(45\u00b0) is 1/\u221a2.\n    \u03c4 = Fd (1/\u221a2) = Fd/\u221a2\n\nThus, the moment of the force about the pivot is `Fd/\u221a2`.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **B: Fd**\n    This expression represents the moment only if the entire force `F` is applied perpendicularly (at 90\u00b0) to the lever arm `d`.

This option incorrectly uses the full magnitude of the force instead of its perpendicular component.\n\n*   **C: Fd\u221a2**\n    This result is dimensionally correct but physically incorrect.

The tension in the string (**T**), acting along the string at an angle of 30\u00b0 to the vertical.\n\nTo maintain equilibrium, the vector sum of these three forces must be zero. This condition can be analysed by resolving the forces into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet's resolve the tension **T** into its vertical (T_y) and horizontal (T_x) components. Using the angle with the vertical (\u03b8 = 30\u00b0):\n*   Vertical component: T_y = T cos(30\u00b0)\n*   Horizontal component: T_x = T sin(30\u00b0)\n\nFor vertical equilibrium, the upward vertical component of tension must balance the downward force of weight:\nT_y = W\nT cos(30\u00b0) = 0.15 N  (Equation 1)\n\nFor horizontal equilibrium, the horizontal component of tension must balance the force from the air flow:\nT_x = F_air\nT sin(30\u00b0) = F_air  (Equation 2)\n\nTo find F_air, we can divide Equation 2 by Equation 1 to eliminate T:\n(T sin(30\u00b0)) / (T cos(30\u00b0)) = F_air / 0.15 N\n\nThis simplifies to:\ntan(30\u00b0) = F_air / 0.15 N\n\nNow, solve for F_air:\nF_air = 0.15 N \u00d7 tan(30\u00b0)\nF_air = 0.15 N \u00d7 0.5774\nF_air \u2248 0.0866 N\n\nRounding to two significant figures (consistent with the provided data) gives 0.087 N.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 0.075 N\nThis answer is obtained by incorrectly assuming that the tension in the string (T) is equal to the weight of the ball (W = 0.15 N) and then calculating the horizontal force as F_air = T sin(30\u00b0). This would give F_air = 0.15 N \u00d7 sin(30\u00b0) = 0.15 N \u00d7 0.5 = 0.075 N. This is incorrect because the tension must be greater than the weight to support the ball and also provide a horizontal force to counteract the air flow. The vertical component of tension alone (T cos(30\u00b0)) is equal to the weight.\n\n#### C: 0.26 N\nThis answer results from an incorrect trigonometric relationship, F_air = W / tan(30\u00b0). This calculation gives F_air = 0.15 N / tan(30\u00b0) \u2248 0.26 N. This error arises from incorrectly relating the forces, for example, by swapping the opposite and adjacent sides in the trigonometric definition of tangent (tan(\u03b8) = opposite/adjacent). The correct relationship is F_air = W tan(30\u00b0), as the air force is opposite and the weight is adjacent to the 30\u00b0 angle in the force vector triangle.\n\n#### D: 0.30 N\nThis answer is obtained from the incorrect calculation F_air = W / sin(30\u00b0), which gives F_air = 0.15 N / 0.5 = 0.30 N.

The formula for upthrust (U) is given by:\n\nU = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 g \u00d7 V_submerged\n\nwhere:\n*   \u03c1_fluid is the density of the fluid.\n*   g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n*   V_submerged is the volume of the object that is submerged in the fluid.\n\nIn this scenario, both objects X and Y are fully submerged in the same liquid. This means:\n1.  The density of the fluid (\u03c1_fluid) is the same for both objects.\n2.  The volume of fluid displaced is equal to the total volume of each object.\nThe problem states that objects X and Y have the same volume. Therefore, V_submerged is identical for both X and Y.\n\nSince \u03c1_fluid, g, and V_submerged are all the same for both objects, the upthrust acting on X must be equal to the upthrust acting on Y.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: The force due to the liquid acting on the top surface of X is greater than that acting on the top surface of Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The force on a surface due to fluid pressure is calculated as F = P \u00d7 A, where P is the pressure and A is the area of the surface. The pressure in a liquid increases with depth (h) according to the formula P = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 g \u00d7 h.\n\nFrom the diagram, the top surface of object X is at a greater depth than the top surface of object Y, so the pressure on the top surface of X is indeed greater than that on Y. However, the objects have the same volume but different shapes. Object X is taller and thinner, while object Y is shorter and wider. This implies that the cross-sectional area of X (A_X) is smaller than that of Y (A_Y).\n\nSince the force is the product of pressure and area (F = P \u00d7 A), we are comparing (larger P) \u00d7 (smaller A) for object X with (smaller P) \u00d7 (larger A) for object Y. Without specific values for the depths and dimensions, it is not possible to conclude that the force on the top surface of X is greater than that on Y.\n\n**B: The pressure difference due to the liquid between the top and bottom surfaces of X is the same as that for Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The upthrust on an object is a result of the pressure difference between its bottom and top surfaces. The pressure difference (\u0394P) between the top and bottom of a submerged cylindrical object is given by \u0394P = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 g \u00d7 L, where L is the vertical height of the cylinder.\n\nAs depicted, object X is taller than object Y (L_X > L_Y). Since both are in the same liquid, the pressure difference for X (\u0394P_X = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 g \u00d7 L_X) will be greater than the pressure difference for Y (\u0394P_Y = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 g \u00d7 L_Y).\n\n**D: The weight of X is the same as the weight of Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The weight (W) of an object is given by W = m \u00d7 g, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Mass can be expressed as the product of density and volume (m = \u03c1_object \u00d7 V). Therefore, W = \u03c1_object \u00d7 V \u00d7 g.\n\nThe problem states that the objects have the same volume (V_X = V_Y). However, it also states that the density of the material of Y is twice the density of the material of X (\u03c1_Y = 2\u03c1_X).\n\nCalculating the weights:\n*   Weight of X: W_X = \u03c1_X \u00d7 V \u00d7 g\n*   Weight of Y: W_Y = \u03c1_Y \u00d7 V \u00d7 g = (2\u03c1_X) \u00d7 V \u00d7 g = 2 \u00d7 (\u03c1_X \u00d7 V \u00d7 g)\n\nThis shows that W_Y = 2W_X. The weight of object Y is twice the weight of object X; they are not the same."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_375.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 an electric car travels at a constant speed of 70kmh\u201c for 80km on a straight horizontal road and\nuses energy e from its battery.\nthe total resistive force acting on the car is proportional to (speed)*. assume that the electric\nmotor is 100% efficient.\nhow much energy is used from the battery when the car travels at a constant speed of 60kmh\nfor 80 km on the straight horizontal road?\na 0.73e b 0.86e \u00a9 12e d 1.4e", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe energy used by the car is equal to the work done by the motor to overcome the total resistive force. The work done (W) by a constant force (F) over a distance (d) is given by the equation:\n*   W = F \u00d7 d\n\nSince the electric motor is 100% efficient, the energy used from the battery (E_battery) is equal to the work done by the motor.\n*   E_battery = W = F \u00d7 d\n\nThe car travels at a constant speed, which means the net force is zero. Therefore, the driving force (F) provided by the motor must be equal in magnitude to the total resistive force (F_r).\n*   F = F_r\n\nThe problem states that the total resistive force is proportional to the square of the speed (v). We can write this as:\n*   F_r = k * v\u00b2\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nCombining these relationships, we find that the energy used from the battery is:\n*   E_battery = (k * v\u00b2) \u00d7 d\n\nThis shows that for a fixed distance (d), the energy used is directly proportional to the square of the speed (E_battery \u221d v\u00b2).\n\nLet E\u2081 be the energy used at speed v\u2081 = 70 km h\u207b\u00b9, and E\u2082 be the energy used at speed v\u2082 = 60 km h\u207b\u00b9. The distance (d = 80 km) is the same in both cases.\n\nWe can set up a ratio:\n*   E\u2082 / E\u2081 = (k * v\u2082\u00b2 * d) / (k * v\u2081\u00b2 * d)\n\nThe constants k and d cancel out:\n*   E\u2082 / E\u2081 = v\u2082\u00b2 / v\u2081\u00b2 = (v\u2082 / v\u2081)\u00b2\n\nSubstituting the given values (and noting that the units cancel):\n*   E\u2082 / E = (60 / 70)\u00b2 = (6 / 7)\u00b2\n*   E\u2082 / E = 36 / 49 \u2248 0.7347\n\nTherefore, the new energy used, E\u2082, is approximately 0.73 times the original energy E.\n*   E\u2082 \u2248 0.73E\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B: 0.86E\nThis result would be obtained if the energy used was directly proportional to the speed (E \u221d v), rather than the square of the speed. In that incorrect scenario, the ratio would be E\u2082/E = v\u2082/v\u2081 = 60/70 \u2248 0.86. However, the energy used is equal to the work done (Force \u00d7 Distance). Since the force is proportional to v\u00b2, the energy used over a fixed distance must also be proportional to v\u00b2.\n\n#### C: 1.2E\nThis answer is incorrect as it implies that travelling at a lower speed uses more energy over the same distance. This contradicts the physical principles involved. A lower speed results in a smaller resistive force (F \u221d v\u00b2), which in turn requires a smaller driving force from the motor. Consequently, less work is done, and less energy is consumed over the same distance. This value is numerically close to the inverse ratio of the speeds (70/60 \u2248 1.17), which has no physical basis in this context.\n\n#### D: 1.4E\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly inverting the correct ratio, calculating (70/60)\u00b2 \u2248 1.36. This suggests that the energy used at the lower speed is significantly greater than the energy used at the higher speed. As explained above, a lower speed leads to a lower resistive force and therefore lower energy consumption for the same distance travelled.

According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy input must equal the sum of the useful energy output and the energy wasted (dissipated), usually as heat.

While the acceleration of free fall, 'g', is a component of the potential energy equation, the fundamental definition of acceleration itself is not used to derive the relationship between force, distance, and energy. The derivation uses the concept of force (which can be defined using acceleration via F=ma), but the crucial step is equating the energy gained to the product of force and distance, which is the definition of work done.\n\n**B) momentum:** Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity (p = mv). It is a measure of an object's quantity of motion. Gravitational potential energy is a form of stored energy related to an object's position in a gravitational field, not its motion. The derivation of potential energy does not involve the object's velocity, so the definition of momentum is not required.\n\n**C) power:** Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred (P = W/t).

Wave X's wavelength (5.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m) is far too short to be a radio wave, which typically has wavelengths longer than 1 meter. Wave Y's frequency (9.4 GHz = 9.4 \u00d7 10\u2079 Hz) is much too low to be ultraviolet, which has frequencies in the range of approximately 8 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz to 3 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 Hz.\n\n**B: ultraviolet, visible**\nThis option is incorrect.

Malus's Law states that the intensity of a plane-polarised light wave after passing through a polarising filter is given by I = I_in * cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where I_in is the incident intensity and \u03b8 is the angle between the initial plane of polarisation and the transmission axis of the filter.\n\n1.  **Initial Setup Analysis:**\n    The problem states that a plane-polarised light wave of intensity I\u2080 is incident on a first polarising filter, and the initial transmitted intensity is 0. This implies that the transmission axis of the first filter is perpendicular (at 90\u00b0) to the plane of polarisation of the incident light. Let's assume, for reference, that the incident light is polarised horizontally. This means the transmission axis of the first filter must be vertical.\n\n2.  **Passage through the Second Filter:**\n    A second filter is inserted between the source and the first filter. The incident light (intensity I\u2080, horizontally polarised) first encounters this second filter.\n    The transmission axis of the second filter is at 45\u00b0 to the transmission axis of the first filter. Since the first filter's axis is vertical, the second filter's axis is at 45\u00b0 to the vertical. This also means it is at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal polarisation of the incident light.\n    Using Malus's Law for the light passing through the second filter:\n    I\u2082 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0)\n    Since cos(45\u00b0) = 1/\u221a2, we have cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = (1/\u221a2)\u00b2 = 1/2.\n    So, the intensity after the second filter is I\u2082 = I\u2080 * (1/2) = I\u2080/2.\n    The light emerging from the second filter is now polarised along its transmission axis (at 45\u00b0 to the vertical).\n\n3.  **Passage through the First Filter:**\n    This light, with intensity I\u2082 = I\u2080/2 and polarised at 45\u00b0 to the vertical, is now incident on the first filter, which has a vertical transmission axis. The angle between the light's new plane of polarisation and the first filter's transmission axis is 45\u00b0.\n    Applying Malus's Law again for the light passing through the first filter:\n    I_final = I\u2082 * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0)\n    I_final = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2)\n    I_final = I\u2080/4\n\nTherefore, the final intensity of the transmitted wave from the filter combination is I\u2080/4.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A) 0:** This would be the intensity if the second polarising filter was not inserted. The incident polarised light and the first filter's transmission axis are perpendicular (90\u00b0), so according to Malus's Law (I = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(90\u00b0)), the transmitted intensity would be zero. The insertion of the second filter at 45\u00b0 changes the polarisation of the light before it reaches the first filter, allowing a component of the light to be transmitted.\n\n*   **B) I\u2080/8:** This result would stem from an incorrect calculation. A common mistake might be to apply the reduction factor of cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = 1/2 twice to an already halved intensity, such as I_final = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/8. However, the intensity is only reduced at each stage of polarisation based on the intensity incident upon that stage. The correct calculation is a two-step process: I\u2082 = I\u2080 * (1/2), and then I_final = I\u2082 * (1/2) = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4.\n\n*   **D) I\u2080/2:** This is the intensity of the light after passing through the second filter but before passing through the first filter. The question asks for the final intensity after the light has passed through the entire filter combination, which includes the first filter. Therefore, the effect of the first filter must also be accounted for, which further reduces the intensity from I\u2080/2 to I\u2080/4."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_385.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 what can explain how stationary waves are formed from progressive waves?\na diffraction\nb polarisation\nc superposition\nd_ the doppler effect", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nA stationary wave, also known as a standing wave, is formed by the **superposition** of two progressive waves of the same frequency, wavelength, and amplitude, travelling in opposite directions. The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point and at any instant is the vector sum of the displacements that each individual wave would cause at that point and instant.\n\nIn the formation of a stationary wave, this principle leads to specific patterns of interference. At certain points, called **nodes**, the two waves are always in antiphase (phase difference of \u03c0 radians or 180\u00b0), resulting in destructive interference and zero amplitude. At other points, called **antinodes**, the waves are always in phase, resulting in constructive interference and maximum (double the individual) amplitude. The energy in a stationary wave is localised between nodes, oscillating between kinetic and potential forms, rather than being propagated along the medium like in a progressive wave. Therefore, superposition is the fundamental principle that explains this phenomenon.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: diffraction**\n**Explanation:**\nDiffraction is the phenomenon where waves bend or spread out as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. While diffraction is a key wave property, it is not the mechanism by which stationary waves are formed. The formation of a stationary wave is due to the interference of two waves. Although the waves that interfere might have been produced by diffraction (for example, waves passing through two slits), the act of forming the stationary pattern itself is explained by superposition, not diffraction.\n\n**B: polarisation**\n**Explanation:**\nPolarisation is a property of transverse waves that describes the orientation of their oscillations. A polarised wave has its oscillations confined to a single plane. While the two progressive waves that form a stationary wave must have the same polarisation to interfere effectively, polarisation itself is not the process of their combination. It is a characteristic of the individual waves, not the principle explaining their interaction to form a stationary wave.\n\n**D: the Doppler effect**\n**Explanation:**\nThe Doppler effect describes the change in the observed frequency and wavelength of a wave due to relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. For a stationary wave to be formed, the two interfering progressive waves must have the same frequency. The Doppler effect, which involves a shift in frequency, is therefore not the principle that explains the formation of a stationary wave."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_386.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 a pipe has a length of 2.0m. it is open at one end and closed at the other end.\na stationary sound wave is set up within the pipe. there are four nodes (n) and four\nantinodes (a) within the length of the pipe.\nn a n a n a n a\n1 1\n\u2018 2.0m\nwhat is the wavelength of the sound wave?\na 0.57m b 1.1m cc 1.3m d 1.6m", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer: B\n\nA stationary wave in a pipe closed at one end and open at the other must have a displacement node (N) at the closed end and a displacement antinode (A) at the open end. The fundamental properties of stationary waves dictate the distances between these points in terms of the wavelength (\u03bb):\n*   The distance between a node and an adjacent antinode is \u03bb/4.\n*   The distance between two consecutive nodes or two consecutive antinodes is \u03bb/2.\n\nThe pattern of nodes and antinodes shown within the pipe is N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A. This pattern consists of a series of segments. We can determine the total length of the pipe by summing the lengths of these segments.\n\nCounting the number of quarter-wavelength (\u03bb/4) segments between adjacent nodes and antinodes:\n*   From the first N to the first A: \u03bb/4\n*   From the first A to the second N: \u03bb/4\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe full pattern N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A contains seven such \u03bb/4 segments. Therefore, the total length of the pipe, L, is equal to seven times this distance:\nL = 7 \u00d7 (\u03bb/4)\n\nGiven that the length of the pipe is L = 2.0 m, we can set up the equation:\n2.0 m = 7\u03bb / 4\n\nTo find the wavelength \u03bb, we rearrange the equation:\n\u03bb = (4 \u00d7 2.0 m) / 7\n\u03bb = 8.0 m / 7\n\u03bb \u2248 1.14 m\n\nThis value is closest to 1.1 m.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 0.57 m**\nThis answer is incorrect. It likely results from a misunderstanding of the distance between nodes and antinodes. If one incorrectly assumes that the distance between an adjacent node and antinode is \u03bb/2, the total length would be considered 7 \u00d7 (\u03bb/2) = 3.5\u03bb. This would lead to a calculation of \u03bb = 2.0 m / 3.5 \u2248 0.57 m. However, the distance between an adjacent node and antinode is correctly defined as \u03bb/4.\n\n**C: 1.3 m**\nThis answer is incorrect. For the wavelength to be 1.3 m, given the relationship L = 7\u03bb/4, the pipe's length would need to be L = 7 \u00d7 (1.3 m) / 4 = 2.275 m. This contradicts the given length of 2.0 m. This value might arise from miscounting the number of \u03bb/4 segments. For instance, counting only six segments would lead to the relationship L = 6\u03bb/4 = 1.5\u03bb, giving \u03bb = 2.0 m / 1.5 \u2248 1.33 m.\n\n**D: 1.6 m**\nThis answer is incorrect. For a wavelength of 1.6 m, the length of the pipe supporting the given wave pattern (L = 7\u03bb/4) would be L = 7 \u00d7 (1.6 m) / 4 = 2.8 m. This is not the given length of 2.0 m. This answer would be correct if the stationary wave pattern had only three nodes and three antinodes, corresponding to a length of L = 5\u03bb/4. In that case, \u03bb = (4 \u00d7 2.0 m) / 5 = 1.6 m.

It consists of a shallow tray of water, a wave generator (vibrator), a light source, and a screen. The vibrator creates continuous plane wavefronts on the water's surface. When a barrier with a gap (an aperture) is placed in the path of these waves, the light projected onto the screen below clearly shows the waves spreading out in a semi-circular pattern after passing through the gap. This spreading is the phenomenon of diffraction. The ripple tank allows for easy visualisation of the two-dimensional wavefronts and demonstrates how the extent of diffraction depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the aperture.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a long spring**\n\nA long spring (often a Slinky) is an excellent tool for demonstrating wave properties in a one-dimensional medium. It can be used to show the propagation of both transverse and longitudinal waves, as well as phenomena like reflection and the formation of standing waves. However, diffraction is the spreading of waves as they pass through an opening or around an obstacle, a phenomenon that is inherently two or three-dimensional. Since a wave on a spring is confined to travel along its one-dimensional length, it is not possible to observe the characteristic spreading of a wavefront that defines diffraction.\n\n**C. a rope**\n\nA rope is used to demonstrate basic properties of transverse waves in a one-dimensional medium. By flicking one end, one can generate a pulse or a continuous wave that travels along its length. It is useful for illustrating concepts such as wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and reflection from a boundary. However, like a spring, a rope is a one-dimensional system. Diffraction involves the bending and spreading of a wavefront into the region behind an obstacle, which requires the wave to be propagating in at least two dimensions. Therefore, a rope is unsuitable for demonstrating diffraction.\n\n**D. a stretched string**\n\nA stretched string, similar to a rope, is a classic apparatus for studying waves in one dimension. It is particularly useful for investigating standing waves, harmonics, and the relationship between wave speed, tension, and linear density. While it effectively demonstrates superposition and resonance, it is not appropriate for demonstrating diffraction. Diffraction is the characteristic spreading of waves in two or three dimensions as they encounter an aperture or obstacle.

This means that any observable electric charge on an object must be an integer multiple of the elementary charge, *e*. The elementary charge is the magnitude of the charge on a single electron (or proton), and its value is approximately 1.60 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C. Therefore, any possible charge *q* must satisfy the equation *q = ne*, where *n* is an integer (n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...).\n\nTo determine which of the given values is not possible, we must divide each charge by the elementary charge *e* and see if the result is an integer.\n\nFor the value 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C:\n*n* = *q* / *e* = (1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C) / (1.60 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C) = 0.625\n\nSince *n* = 0.625 is not an integer, it is impossible for an oil droplet (or any object) to have this amount of charge.

An object with zero net charge is electrically neutral. This corresponds to the case where the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons.

According to the power dissipation formula, P = I\u00b2R, power is directly proportional to the square of the current for a fixed resistor. A decrease in current would necessarily lead to a decrease in the power dissipated. However, the problem states that the power dissipated in resistor X *increases*. Therefore, the new current must be greater than the initial current, making this option incorrect.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis answer, 4.5 A, is obtained by making an incorrect assumption about the relationship between power and current. If one assumes a linear relationship (P \u221d I), a 50% increase in power (multiplication by 1.5) would imply a 50% increase in current. This would lead to a calculation of I\u2082 = 1.5 \u00d7 I\u2081 = 1.5 \u00d7 3.0 A = 4.5 A. However, the correct physical relationship is P = I\u00b2R, meaning power is proportional to the *square* of the current. The relationship is not linear, and this reasoning is fundamentally flawed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThe calculated correct value for the new current is approximately 3.7 A. A value of 14 A is significantly different and cannot be reached through correct application of the relevant physics principles (P = I\u00b2R).

Since the potential difference (V) is kept constant, the current (I) is inversely proportional to the resistance (R).\nI \u221d 1/R\n\nThe resistance (R) of a wire is determined by its material properties and dimensions, according to the formula:\nR = \u03c1l/A\nwhere \u03c1 (rho) is the resistivity of the material, l is the length of the wire, and A is its cross-sectional area.\n\nThe problem states that the type of metal is kept the same, so the resistivity (\u03c1) is constant. Therefore, the resistance is directly proportional to the length (l) and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (A).\nR \u221d l/A\n\nThe wire is cylindrical, so its cross-sectional area (A) is given by the formula for the area of a circle, A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. The diameter (d) is twice the radius (r = d/2). Substituting this into the area formula gives:\nA = \u03c0(d/2)\u00b2 = (\u03c0/4)d\u00b2\nThis shows that the cross-sectional area (A) is directly proportional to the square of the diameter (d\u00b2).\nA \u221d d\u00b2\n\nNow we can combine these relationships.\nSince I \u221d 1/R and R \u221d l/A, it follows that:\nI \u221d 1 / (l/A)\nI \u221d A/l\n\nSubstituting the relationship for area (A \u221d d\u00b2):\nI \u221d d\u00b2/l\n\nTherefore, the current (I) is inversely proportional to the length (l) and directly proportional to the square of the diameter (d\u00b2).\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A: It is directly proportional to l and inversely proportional to d.**\nThis is incorrect. Current (I) is inversely proportional to resistance (R). Since resistance is directly proportional to length (R \u221d l), current must be inversely proportional to length (I \u221d 1/l). Furthermore, resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (R \u221d 1/A), and area is proportional to the square of the diameter (A \u221d d\u00b2). This means resistance is inversely proportional to d\u00b2 (R \u221d 1/d\u00b2), and consequently, current is directly proportional to d\u00b2 (I \u221d d\u00b2), not inversely proportional to d.\n\n**B: It is directly proportional to l and inversely proportional to d\u00b2.**\nThis is incorrect. As established from Ohm's Law (I = V/R) and the resistance formula (R = \u03c1l/A), current is inversely proportional to resistance. Because resistance is directly proportional to length (R \u221d l), the current must be inversely proportional to the length (I \u221d 1/l), not directly proportional. While it correctly identifies an inverse relationship with a squared term of the diameter, it incorrectly applies it; current is directly proportional to d\u00b2.\n\n**C: It is inversely proportional to l and directly proportional to d.**\nThis is partially correct but ultimately flawed. The statement that the current is inversely proportional to the length (l) is correct. However, the relationship with the diameter is incorrect. Current is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area (A), and the area is proportional to the square of the diameter (d\u00b2). Therefore, the current is directly proportional to d\u00b2, not just d.

The voltmeter measures the potential difference (p.d.) between the midpoints of the two parallel branches. Let the potential at the midpoint of the left branch be V_L and the potential at the midpoint of the right branch be V_R. The voltmeter reading, V, is given by V = V_L - V_R, because its positive terminal is connected to the left branch and its negative terminal to the right.\n\nThe problem states that the initial reading is positive, which means V_L > V_R. To cause the voltmeter reading to decrease, we must either decrease V_L, increase V_R, or a combination of both, thereby reducing the difference between them.\n\n1.  **Analysing the left branch:** This branch is a potential divider consisting of a fixed resistor and a thermistor (specifically, a Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC thermistor, as is standard). The potential V_L is the p.d. across the thermistor. According to the potential divider principle, V_L is proportional to the resistance of the thermistor (R_th). To decrease V_L, the resistance of the thermistor must decrease. For an NTC thermistor, resistance decreases as temperature **increases**.\n\n2.  **Analysing the right branch:** This branch is a potential divider consisting of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a fixed resistor. The potential V_R is the p.d. across the bottom fixed resistor. According to the potential divider principle, V_R will increase if the resistance of the LDR (R_LDR) decreases (as this increases the share of the total voltage across the fixed resistor). The resistance of an LDR decreases as light intensity **increases**.\n\nTherefore, increasing the temperature decreases V_L, and increasing the light intensity increases V_R. Both of these changes cause the potential difference V = V_L - V_R to decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### B: no change in temperature, decrease in light intensity\n\nA decrease in light intensity causes the resistance of the LDR to increase. In the right-hand potential divider, this means the LDR takes a larger share of the supply voltage, and the fixed resistor's share (V_R) decreases. With no change in temperature, V_L remains constant. Since V = V_L - V_R, and V_R is decreasing while V_L is constant, the voltmeter reading V will **increase**.\n\n#### C: decrease in temperature, no change in light intensity\n\nA decrease in temperature causes the resistance of the NTC thermistor to increase. In the left-hand potential divider, this means the thermistor takes a larger share of the supply voltage, so V_L increases. With no change in light intensity, V_R remains constant. Since V = V_L - V_R, and V_L is increasing while V_R is constant, the voltmeter reading V will **increase**.\n\n#### D: decrease in temperature, decrease in light intensity\n\nThis option combines the effects described for B and C. A decrease in temperature causes V_L to increase, and a decrease in light intensity causes V_R to decrease. Both effects contribute to increasing the potential difference V = V_L - V_R.

This e.m.f. represents the total energy supplied to each unit of charge by the battery. As this charge moves through the circuit, it loses potential energy as it passes through each resistor. The potential difference across a resistor is the measure of this energy loss per unit charge.\n\nAccording to the conservation of energy, the total energy gained per unit charge (the e.m.f.) must equal the total energy lost per unit charge (the sum of the p.d.s across all the resistors). Therefore, the sum of the potential differences across all the series resistors is equal to the e.m.f., E, of the battery.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The e.m.f. across each resistor equals the potential difference across the battery.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect due to a fundamental misuse of terminology. Resistors are passive components that dissipate electrical energy; they do not generate an electromotive force. An e.m.f. is associated with sources of energy, such as batteries, that convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. A potential difference exists across a resistor, but not an e.m.f.\n\n**B: The potential difference across each resistor equals the e.m.f. E of the battery.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for a series circuit containing more than one resistor. In a series circuit, the total e.m.f. supplied by the battery is divided among the components in the circuit. Each resistor will have a potential difference across it that is proportional to its resistance (V = IR). The sum of these individual potential differences equals the total e.m.f. (E). Therefore, the potential difference across a single resistor is only a fraction of the total e.m.f., not equal to it, unless it is the only resistor in the circuit.\n\n**C: The sum of the e.m.f.s across the resistors equals the potential difference across the battery.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for the same reason as option A. It wrongly attributes an electromotive force to the resistors. Resistors cause a potential drop (a potential difference) as they convert electrical energy into other forms (mainly heat).

This law states that the sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) in any closed loop of a circuit is equal to the sum of the potential drops (p.d.s) across the components in that same loop.

If one calculates the equivalent resistance of the middle group (6 resistors in parallel) as 6.0 \u03a9 / 6 = 1.0 \u03a9 and then incorrectly assumes that all three series groups have this same resistance, the total would be calculated as 1.0 \u03a9 + 1.0 \u03a9 + 1.0 \u03a9 = 3.0 \u03a9. This is incorrect because the left and right groups have only three resistors each, so their equivalent resistance is 6.0 \u03a9 / 3 = 2.0 \u03a9, not 1.0 \u03a9.\n\n#### C: 7.2 \u03a9\n\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly applying the rules for series and parallel resistors. A common mistake is to calculate the resistance of a parallel group by multiplying the individual resistance by the number of resistors (as if they were in series).\n*   Incorrect resistance of the left group: 3 \u00d7 6.0 \u03a9 = 18 \u03a9.\n*   Incorrect resistance of the middle group: 6 \u00d7 6.0 \u03a9 = 36 \u03a9.\n*   Incorrect resistance of the right group: 3 \u00d7 6.0 \u03a9 = 18 \u03a9.\nIf these incorrect values are then combined using the formula for parallel resistors (1/R_total = 1/R\u2081 + 1/R\u2082 + 1/R\u2083), the result is:\n1/R_total = 1/18 + 1/36 + 1/18 = 2/36 + 1/36 + 2/36 = 5/36.\nR_total = 36/5 = 7.2 \u03a9.\nThis procedure confuses the application of series and parallel formulas. The groups are in series, not parallel, and the resistors within each group are in parallel, so their equivalent resistance is found by division (R/n), not multiplication.\n\n#### D: 18 \u03a9\n\nThis answer results from oversimplifying the circuit. If one assumes that the current follows a single path through one resistor from each of the three groups, the circuit would be treated as three 6.0 \u03a9 resistors connected in series. The total resistance would then be calculated as R_total = 6.0 \u03a9 + 6.0 \u03a9 + 6.0 \u03a9 = 18 \u03a9. This is incorrect because it ignores the effect of the parallel resistors in each group, which provide multiple paths for the current and thus reduce the overall resistance of each group."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_397.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "37 in the circuit shown, a battery of negligible internal resistance is connected in series with a pair of\nfixed resistors r; and ro.\nr,} |60q\n=\n6.0v |\n\u2014_l_. \u00bb.4\nr,} }20q\ny\nthe circuit is to be used to test whether the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a particular cell is 1.5v.\nthe cell is connected between terminals x and y in parallel with r2 and in series with a\ngalvanometer.\nwhich statement about the test is correct?\na_ any non-zero reading on the galvanometer means the cell has an e.m.f. of 1.5v.\nb_ the battery does not need to have an e.m.f. of 6.0v.\nc_ the cell may be connected either way round between x and y.\nd_ the galvanometer does not need a scale calibrated in amperes.", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**D. The galvanometer does not need a scale calibrated in amperes.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The circuit shown is a type of potentiometer or null-balance circuit. Its purpose is to compare an unknown electromotive force (e.m.f.) with a known potential difference (p.d.). The measurement is taken when the galvanometer reading is zero, a condition known as the 'null point' or 'balance point'.\n\nAt the balance point, there is no current flowing through the galvanometer and the test cell. This occurs when the e.m.f. of the test cell is exactly equal and opposite to the p.d. across resistor R\u2082. Since the objective is simply to find the condition of zero current, the galvanometer only needs to act as a sensitive current detector to indicate whether a current is present and, perhaps, its direction. The actual magnitude of the current when the circuit is unbalanced is irrelevant to the final measurement. Therefore, a calibrated scale in amperes is not required; a central-zero galvanometer that shows the presence and direction of a small current is sufficient.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Any non-zero reading on the galvanometer means the cell has an e.m.f. of 1.5 V.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The circuit is designed to produce a specific potential difference across resistor R\u2082. Using the potential divider principle, the p.d. across R\u2082 is:\n\nV_R\u2082 = (R\u2082 / (R\u2081 + R\u2082)) * V_battery\nV_R\u2082 = (20 \u03a9 / (60 \u03a9 + 20 \u03a9)) * 6.0 V\nV_R\u2082 = (20 / 80) * 6.0 V = 0.25 * 6.0 V = 1.5 V\n\nA zero reading (null deflection) on the galvanometer indicates that no current is flowing through the test cell. This happens only when the e.m.f. of the test cell is exactly equal to the 1.5 V potential difference across R\u2082. Conversely, any non-zero reading on the galvanometer signifies that there is a net potential difference in that branch of the circuit, meaning the e.m.f. of the cell is *not* equal to 1.5 V.\n\n**B. The battery does not need to have an e.m.f. of 6.0 V.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The potential difference across R\u2082, which is used as the reference voltage to test the cell, is directly proportional to the e.m.f. of the main battery. As calculated above, for the p.d. across R\u2082 to be precisely 1.5 V (the value being tested), the battery's e.m.f. must be 6.0 V. If the battery had a different e.m.f., the p.d. across R\u2082 would also be different, and the circuit would test for a different cell e.m.f. For example, if the battery were 8.0 V, the p.d. across R\u2082 would be 2.0 V. Therefore, the 6.0 V e.m.f. of the battery is essential for this specific test.\n\n**C. The cell may be connected either way round between X and Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. For a null balance to be achieved, the e.m.f. of the test cell must oppose the potential difference across R\u2082. In the main circuit, the top of R\u2081 is connected to the positive terminal of the 6.0 V battery, making the potential at the junction between R\u2081 and R\u2082 higher than the potential at the bottom wire. This means the p.d. across R\u2082 is such that the upper end is positive relative to the lower end. To oppose this, the positive terminal of the test cell must be connected to the point of higher potential (terminal X) and its negative terminal to the point of lower potential (terminal Y). If the cell were connected in the reverse direction, its e.m.f. would add to the p.d. across R\u2082, causing a large current to flow through the galvanometer, and it would be impossible to achieve a balance."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_398.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "38 two nuclides are different isotopes of the same element.\nwhich statement about the nuclides is correct?\na_ neutral atoms of the nuclides have the same number of electrons.\nb_ nuclei of the nuclides have different numbers of protons.\nc_ nuclei of the nuclides have the same number of nucleons.\nd_ nuclei of the nuclides have the same number of neutrons.", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nBy definition, isotopes are different forms of the same element.

The \u03b1-particle has twice the charge of a proton (+2*e* vs +*e*) but approximately four times the mass (\u22484*m*\u209a vs *m*\u209a). This results in the \u03b1-particle's charge-to-mass ratio (proportional to 2/4 = 0.5) being half that of the proton (proportional to 1/1 = 1).

They can be caused by factors such as slight variations in experimental conditions, limitations in reading an instrument, or inherent instability in the system being measured. These errors cause the measurements to be scattered around a central value, with some readings being slightly higher and others slightly lower. When a large number of measurements are averaged, these positive and negative deviations tend to cancel each other out. This makes the calculated average a more reliable estimate of the true value than any single measurement, thus reducing the effect of random error.\n\n*   **Systematic Error:** Systematic errors are consistent, repeatable errors that cause all measurements to be shifted in the same direction away from the true value. These errors are typically due to a flaw in the experimental apparatus (e.g., a zero error on a measuring device) or the experimental procedure. Since every measurement is affected by this error in the same way (e.g., every reading is 0.5 cm too long), taking the average of these measurements will not eliminate or reduce the error. The resulting average will simply be shifted from the true value by the same systematic amount. Therefore, systematic error is unaffected by averaging.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect because averaging does not reduce systematic error. A systematic error represents a constant bias that affects all measurements equally and in the same direction. When measurements containing a systematic error are averaged, the resulting mean value will also carry this same bias. The process of averaging only mitigates the effect of unpredictable random fluctuations, not consistent offsets.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect because averaging has a direct and important effect on random error. Random errors cause individual measurements to vary unpredictably. By taking the average of multiple readings, the positive and negative random deviations tend to cancel each other out, leading to a mean value that is more precise and a better estimate of the expected value. Therefore, the effect of random error is reduced, not unaffected.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement incorrectly reverses the effects of averaging on the two types of errors. The effect of random error is reduced through averaging because the unpredictable positive and negative fluctuations tend to cancel out.

In the vector addition triangle, `v` and `v_w` form the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, and the velocity of the boat in still water, `v_b`, must be the hypotenuse.\n\nThe angle `\u03b8` is defined as the angle between the direction of the boat in still water (`v_b`) and the direction of the resultant velocity (`v`). In our right-angled vector triangle, this corresponds to the angle between the hypotenuse and the side representing `v`.\n\nTo find the value of `\u03b8`, we can use trigonometry:\nsin(\u03b8) = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse) = `v_w` / `v_b`\nsin(\u03b8) = 4.0 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 6.0 m s\u207b\u00b9 = 2/3\n\u03b8 = arcsin(2/3) \u2248 41.8\u00b0\n\nTo two significant figures, `\u03b8` is 42\u00b0.\n\nTo find the magnitude of the resultant velocity `v`, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to the vector triangle:\n`v_b`\u00b2 = `v_w`\u00b2 + `v`\u00b2\n`v`\u00b2 = `v_b`\u00b2 - `v_w`\u00b2\n`v`\u00b2 = (6.0)\u00b2 - (4.0)\u00b2 = 36 - 16 = 20\n`v` = \u221a20 \u2248 4.47 m s\u207b\u00b9\n\nTo two significant figures, `v` is 4.5 m s\u207b\u00b9.\nTherefore, the correct values are `\u03b8` = 42\u00b0 and `v` = 4.5 m s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly identifies the angle `\u03b8` as 42\u00b0 but provides an incorrect value for the resultant velocity `v`. The value `v` = 7.2 m s\u207b\u00b9 would be obtained by incorrectly applying the Pythagorean theorem, assuming that the resultant velocity `v` is the hypotenuse of the vector triangle:\nIncorrect calculation: `v`\u00b2 = `v_b`\u00b2 + `v_w`\u00b2 = (6.0)\u00b2 + (4.0)\u00b2 = 36 + 16 = 52, which gives `v` = \u221a52 \u2248 7.2 m s\u207b\u00b9.\n\nThis is conceptually incorrect. The resultant velocity `v` is a component of the motion, not the overall velocity of the boat relative to the water. The velocity of the boat in still water, `v_b` (6.0 m s\u207b\u00b9), represents the total effort of the boat's engine and must be the longest side (hypotenuse) of the vector triangle, as it is composed of both the forward motion across the river (`v`) and the motion against the current.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option correctly identifies the resultant velocity `v` as 4.5 m s\u207b\u00b9 but provides an incorrect value for the angle `\u03b8`. The value `\u03b8` = 48\u00b0 is approximately 90\u00b0 - 42\u00b0. This error arises from incorrectly defining the trigonometric relationship. It is the result of calculating `\u03b8` using the cosine function instead of the sine function:\nIncorrect calculation: cos(\u03b8) = 4.0 / 6.0, which gives \u03b8 \u2248 48.2\u00b0.\n\nThis is incorrect because the angle `\u03b8` is defined with respect to the line perpendicular to the banks (the direction of `v`). In the right-angled vector triangle, the velocity of the water, `v_w` (4.0 m s\u207b\u00b9), is the side *opposite* to the angle `\u03b8`, not adjacent. Therefore, the sine function (sin = opposite/hypotenuse) must be used.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because both the value for the angle `\u03b8` and the resultant velocity `v` are incorrect. It combines the two separate errors explained for options B and C.\n1.  The value for `v` (7.2 m s\u207b\u00b9) is derived from incorrectly treating the resultant velocity `v` as the hypotenuse in the Pythagorean theorem.\n2.  The value for `\u03b8` (48\u00b0) is derived from incorrectly using the cosine function instead of the sine function based on the geometry of the vector triangle.\n\nThis indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how to construct and solve the vector addition problem."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_405.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "5 a student walks at a constant speed for a distance of 50 m in a time of 40s. the student rests for\na time of 10s and then walks back to the starting point at a constant speed in a time of 30s.\nwhat is the distance\u2014time graph for the motion of the student?\n\na b\n1004 see 100 spe seerecmenemecees\ndistance/m distance/m\n2) se tetas 50+4-------- bom anna nnn ne\n0 0\n0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80\ntime/s time/s\nc d\na 00 nil liima\u201d\ndistance/m distance/m\nbo arhes ese ese sorereehee 50 =eeeeeneeess smee\n0 0\n0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80\ntime/s time/s", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\nA distance-time graph plots the total distance travelled (a scalar quantity) against time.

During this period, their speed is zero, and the total distance travelled does not change. This is correctly shown as a horizontal line segment (zero gradient) from t = 40 s to t = 50 s, at a constant distance of 50 m.\n\n3.  **Third phase of motion (50 s to 80 s):** The student walks back to the starting point, covering another 50 m in 30 s. Since distance is a scalar quantity representing the total path length, it continues to accumulate. The total distance travelled increases from 50 m to 100 m (50 m out + 50 m back). This motion takes 30 s, so it occurs between t = 50 s and t = 80 s. As the speed is constant, this is represented by a straight line with a positive gradient, connecting the point (50 s, 50 m) to the point (80 s, 100 m).\n\nGraph D correctly illustrates all three phases of the student's motion.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A**\nThis graph correctly represents the first two phases of motion: travelling 50 m in 40 s and then resting for 10 s. However, the third segment is incorrect. It shows the distance decreasing from 50 m to 0 m. This would represent a displacement-time graph, where displacement is the straight-line distance from the origin. The question asks for a distance-time graph. Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total path covered and can only increase or stay constant; it can never decrease. Therefore, the final segment should show the distance increasing from 50 m to 100 m.\n\n**B**\nThis graph incorrectly represents the timing of the motion. The first segment shows the student travelling 50 m in 30 s, whereas the problem states this journey took 40 s. Consequently, the rest period is also shown with incorrect timing (from t = 30 s to t = 50 s, a duration of 20 s), which contradicts the 10 s rest period specified in the problem.\n\n**C**\nThis graph correctly represents the first phase of motion. However, the second phase, the rest period, is shown to last from t = 40 s to t = 60 s, which is a duration of 20 s. This is incorrect, as the student only rests for 10 s. Furthermore, similar to graph A, the third segment incorrectly plots displacement instead of distance by showing a decrease in the vertical axis value.

The relevant equation relating displacement (`s`), initial velocity (`u`), time (`t`), and acceleration (`a`) is:\n`s = ut + (1/2)at^2`\n\nIn this problem, the object falls from rest, so its initial velocity `u` is 0. The equation simplifies to:\n`s = (1/2)at^2`\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the time taken, `t`:\n`2s = at^2`\n`t^2 = 2s/a`\n`t = \u221a(2s/a)`\n\nThis relationship shows that for a constant distance of fall `s`, the time `t` is inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration `a`. We can write this as `t \u221d 1/\u221aa`.\n\nWe can now form a ratio of the time taken on Mars (`T_M`) to the time taken on Earth (`T_E`):\n`T_M / T_E = \u221a(a_E / a_M)`\n\nHere, `a_M` is the acceleration of free fall on Mars, given as `g_M = 3.71 m/s\u00b2`, and `a_E` is the acceleration of free fall on Earth, which is a standard value of `g_E \u2248 9.81 m/s\u00b2`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio:\n`T_M / T_E = \u221a(9.81 / 3.71)`\n`T_M / T_E = \u221a2.6442...`\n`T_M / T_E \u2248 1.626`\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is 1.63.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. 0.378**\nThis value is obtained by calculating the direct ratio of the accelerations, `g_M / g_E`:\n`3.71 / 9.81 \u2248 0.378`.\nThis is incorrect because the relationship between time and acceleration is not a simple inverse proportion (`t \u221d 1/a`). Instead, time is inversely proportional to the *square root* of the acceleration (`t \u221d 1/\u221aa`).\n\n**B. 0.615**\nThis value is the result of taking the square root of the incorrect ratio `g_M / g_E`:\n`\u221a(3.71 / 9.81) \u2248 \u221a0.378 \u2248 0.615`.\nThis incorrectly inverts the ratio of accelerations within the square root. This calculation finds the ratio `T_E / T_M`, not `T_M / T_E`. Since the acceleration on Mars is less than on Earth, it should take a longer time to fall the same distance, meaning the ratio `T_M / T_E` must be greater than 1.\n\n**D. 2.64**\nThis value is the ratio `g_E / g_M`:\n`9.81 / 3.71 \u2248 2.64`.\nThis is the ratio of the times squared (`T_M\u00b2 / T_E\u00b2`), not the ratio of the times. The derivation `s = (1/2)at^2` leads to `t^2 = 2s/a`. Therefore, `T_M\u00b2 / T_E\u00b2 = g_E / g_M`.

Mass resists changes in motion.**\n\nThis statement is the correct definition of inertial mass. Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to resist any change in its state of motion. Mass is the quantitative measure of this inertia. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force. A larger mass has greater inertia, meaning a greater force is required to produce a given change in its velocity (i.e., a given acceleration). Therefore, stating that mass resists changes in motion is a fundamental and accurate description of this physical property.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n**A. Mass has a magnitude and a direction.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because mass is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. A scalar quantity is fully described by its magnitude (a numerical value and a unit, e.g., 5 kg). A vector quantity, such as force or velocity, requires both a magnitude and a direction to be fully described. Mass has no direction associated with it.\n\n**C. The greater the mass of an object, the greater its acceleration when falling in a vacuum.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. In a vacuum, the only force acting on a falling object is the force of gravity, which is its weight (W). According to Newton's Second Law, the net force on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F_net = ma). For a freely falling object, F_net = W = mg, where 'g' is the acceleration of free fall.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for force:\nmg = ma\n\nThe mass 'm' on both sides of the equation cancels out, leaving:\na = g\n\nThis shows that the acceleration of an object in a vacuum is independent of its mass. All objects, regardless of their mass, fall with the same constant acceleration 'g'.\n\n**D. The mass of an object depends on its location.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It confuses mass with weight. Mass is an intrinsic property of an object, representing the amount of matter it contains. The mass of an object is constant regardless of its location in the universe. In contrast, weight is the force of gravity acting on an object (W = mg). Since the gravitational field strength 'g' varies with location (for example, it is weaker on the Moon than on Earth), the weight of an object changes depending on its location.

The question asks for the magnitude of the average force, which is **7.0 N**.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n#### A) 1.4 N\n\nThis value is obtained by calculating the final momentum of the ball (`p_final = m \u00d7 v`) but using the final speed: `0.200 kg \u00d7 7.0 m/s = 1.4 kg\u00b7m/s`. This result represents the magnitude of the final momentum, not the average force. Force is the *rate of change* of momentum, which requires considering both the initial momentum and the contact time, neither of which is included in this incorrect calculation.\n\n#### B) 2.3 N\n\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly treating velocity as a scalar (speed) and calculating the change in speed instead of the change in velocity.\n*   Incorrect calculation: F = m \u00d7 (change in speed) / \u0394t = 0.200 kg \u00d7 (14.0 m/s - 7.0 m/s) / 0.60 s = (0.200 \u00d7 7.0) / 0.60 \u2248 2.3 N.\nThis approach fails to account for the reversal in the ball's direction. Since velocity is a vector, the change in velocity is `v - u = (-7.0) - (+14.0) = -21.0 m/s`, which has a magnitude of 21.0 m/s, not 7.0 m/s.\n\n#### C) 4.2 N\n\nThis value represents the magnitude of the change in momentum (also known as impulse), not the average force.\n*   Impulse = |\u0394p| = |m(v - u)| = |0.200 kg \u00d7 (-7.0 m/s - 14.0 m/s)| = |-4.2 kg\u00b7m/s| = 4.2 N\u00b7s.\nTo find the average force, this change in momentum must be divided by the time over which it occurs (`\u0394t = 0.60 s`). The calculation `4.2 / 0.60` gives the correct force of 7.0 N.

Air resistance, which is a drag force dependent on the object's velocity, is therefore also zero at the start. As the ball accelerates downwards due to gravity, its velocity increases. This causes the air resistance, which opposes the motion (acting upwards), to increase. The rate of acceleration decreases as the air resistance grows. Eventually, the ball reaches terminal velocity, a constant maximum velocity. At this point, the velocity is no longer changing, so the air resistance becomes constant at its maximum value. The graph for force X shows a value starting at zero, increasing over time with a decreasing slope, and finally approaching a constant value, which perfectly models the behaviour of air resistance.\n\n*   **Force Y as Resultant Force:** The resultant (or net) force on the ball is the vector sum of the forces acting on it: Resultant Force = Weight - Air Resistance (taking the downward direction as positive). At t=0, the velocity is zero, so air resistance is zero. The resultant force is therefore at its maximum value, equal to the weight of the ball. As the ball's velocity and hence the air resistance increase, the resultant force decreases. When the ball reaches terminal velocity, the upward air resistance force becomes equal in magnitude to the downward weight. The resultant force on the ball becomes zero, and according to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), the acceleration is zero, which is why the velocity is constant. The graph for force Y shows a value starting at a maximum, decreasing over time, and approaching zero, which perfectly models the behaviour of the resultant force.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**Option B is incorrect.** While the identification of force X as air resistance is correct, force Y cannot be weight. The weight of the ball is the product of its mass and the gravitational field strength (W=mg). Assuming the fall occurs over a height where the gravitational field is constant, the weight is a constant force acting on the ball throughout its motion. The graph for force Y, however, depicts a force that decreases over time.\n\n**Option C is incorrect.** Force X cannot be upthrust. Upthrust is the buoyant force exerted by the displaced fluid (air, in this case). It is constant as long as the density of the air and the volume of the ball do not change. The graph for force X shows a force that starts at zero and increases with time, which is inconsistent with the constant nature of upthrust.\n\n**Option D is incorrect.** This option incorrectly identifies both forces. As explained for option C, force X cannot be the constant upthrust. As explained for option B, force Y cannot be the constant weight. Both graphs show forces that vary with time, whereas both upthrust and weight are constant forces in this scenario."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_410.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "10 an object x of mass 0.30kg is travelling in a straight line at a constant velocity of 3.0ms\"' ona\nhorizontal frictionless surface. object x collides with a stationary object y of mass 0.50 kg.\nafter the collision, x moves with a velocity of 2.0ms~ at an angle of 60\u00b0 to its direction before the\ncollision. object y moves with a velocity v at an angle of 41\u00b0 to the direction of x before the\ncollision, as shown.\nom\n3.0ms\" @) yar\nx y jeo\"\n0.30kg 0.50kg xq 20ms\"\nbefore collision after collision\nwhat is the value of v?\na 0.80ms\" b 1.2ms* cc 1.6ms\u2122 d 1.8ms*", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe principle of conservation of linear momentum states that in the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant. As the collision occurs on a frictionless surface, momentum is conserved. This principle applies to vector components, so we can analyse the momentum in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions independently. Let the initial direction of object X be the positive x-direction.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum in the Vertical (y) Direction:**\n\nInitially, neither object has any velocity in the y-direction, so the total initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n`p_initial, y = 0`\n\nAfter the collision, object X has a downward (negative) component of momentum, and object Y has an upward (positive) component. For the total final momentum in the y-direction to remain zero, these two components must be equal in magnitude.\n\n`p_final, y = m_Y * v_Yy - m_X * v_Xy = 0`\nwhere `v_Yy` is the y-component of Y's velocity and `v_Xy` is the y-component of X's velocity.\n\nThis gives: `m_Y * v_Yy = m_X * v_Xy`\n\nThe velocity components are found using trigonometry:\n`v_Yy = v * sin(41\u00b0)`\n`v_Xy = (2.0 m/s) * sin(60\u00b0)`\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation:\n`m_Y * v * sin(41\u00b0) = m_X * (2.0) * sin(60\u00b0)`\n\nNow, substitute the known masses and solve for `v`:\n`(0.50 kg) * v * sin(41\u00b0) = (0.30 kg) * (2.0 m/s) * sin(60\u00b0)`\n`v = [(0.30 * 2.0 * sin(60\u00b0)) / (0.50 * sin(41\u00b0))]`\n`v = [(0.60 * 0.866) / (0.50 * 0.656)]`\n`v = 0.5196 / 0.328`\n`v \u2248 1.584 m/s`\n\nTo two significant figures, `v = 1.6 m/s`.\n\nThis result can be verified by applying the conservation of momentum in the horizontal (x) direction, which yields the same value for `v`.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 0.80 ms\u207b\u00b9\nThis answer may arise from a calculation error, specifically by neglecting the mass of object Y when considering its final momentum. If one were to incorrectly set up the conservation of horizontal momentum as `p_initial, x = p_final, x` and omit `m_Y` from the final term for Y, the calculation would be: `(0.30 * 3.0) = (0.30 * 2.0 * cos(60\u00b0)) + v * cos(41\u00b0)`, which leads to `v \u2248 0.80 m/s`. This is incorrect because momentum is the product of mass and velocity (`p=mv`), and the mass of object Y cannot be ignored.\n\n#### B: 1.2 ms\u207b\u00b9\nThis value is obtained if the velocity of object Y is treated as a scalar quantity in the horizontal direction, rather than resolving its vector component. Applying conservation of horizontal momentum: `p_initial, x = p_final, x`. The correct final momentum is `m_X*v_X*cos(60\u00b0) + m_Y*v*cos(41\u00b0)`. If the `cos(41\u00b0)` term is omitted, the equation becomes `(0.30 * 3.0) = (0.30 * 2.0 * cos(60\u00b0)) + (0.50 * v)`. This simplifies to `0.90 = 0.30 + 0.50v`, which gives `v = 1.2 m/s`. This is incorrect because momentum is a vector, and only the component of Y's momentum along the horizontal axis contributes to the conservation in that direction.\n\n#### D: 1.8 ms\u207b\u00b9\nThis answer likely results from a misapplication of the conservation laws, such as confusing the horizontal and vertical components. For instance, if one correctly calculates the horizontal momentum that must be carried by object Y (`p_Yx = p_total_initial - p_Xx = 0.90 - 0.30 = 0.60 kg m/s`), but then incorrectly relates this to its vertical velocity component by dividing by `m_Y * sin(41\u00b0)`, the calculation would be `v = 0.60 / (0.50 * sin(41\u00b0)) \u2248 1.83 m/s`. This is incorrect because the horizontal momentum component must be related to the horizontal velocity component (`v * cos(41\u00b0)`)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_411.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "11. a.uniform rigid beam of length 3.2 m is pivoted at its centre. two children sit at the opposite ends\nof the beam, as shown.\nchild :\nmass 24 kg 3.2m\n4 @)' child\nial mass 36 kg\nivot ee\never f\\ pes\none child has a mass of 24 kg. the other child has a mass of 36 kg. the heavier child causes one\nend of the beam to permanently rest on the ground, so that the beam makes an angle of 20\u00b0 to\nthe horizontal ground.\nwhat is the moment of the weight of the 24 kg child about the pivot?\na 72nm b 130nm c 350nm d 380nm", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe moment of a force about a pivot is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force.\n\n1.  **Calculate the force:** The force is the weight (W) of the 24 kg child.

Second, incorrectly using the horizontal component of tension (*T* cos(40\u00b0)) instead of the vertical component (*T* sin(40\u00b0)) to calculate the opposing moment. This would lead to the incorrect equation: 200 \u00d7 *L* = (*T* cos(40\u00b0)) \u00d7 *L*, which gives *T* \u2248 261 N. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of both the center of mass and the calculation of torque.\n\n#### D: 310 N\nThis incorrect value arises from misidentifying the point where the weight of the boom acts. The calculation leading to this answer assumes the entire weight (200 N) acts at the far end of the boom (at distance *L* from the pivot) instead of at its center of mass (at distance *L*/2). This would lead to the incorrect equation 200 \u00d7 *L* = (*T* sin(40\u00b0)) \u00d7 *L*, resulting in *T* = 200 / sin(40\u00b0) \u2248 311 N.

The standard formula for pressure (P) is P = F/A, where F is the normal force and A is the area over which this force is distributed. This definition explains how a concentrated force can exert a very high pressure (like the point of a nail), while the same force spread over a large area results in low pressure. The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), which is equivalent to one newton per square meter (N/m\u00b2), directly reflecting the definition of force per unit area.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. mass per unit area**\nThis expression describes surface density (or areal density), not pressure. Surface density is a measure of mass distributed over a two-dimensional surface. Pressure is fundamentally about force, which is a vector quantity (specifically, a push or a pull), whereas mass is a scalar quantity representing the amount of matter in an object. While the mass of an object is the source of its weight (a force), mass itself is not a force, and therefore mass per unit area is not pressure.\n\n**C. mass per unit volume**\nThis expression defines density (\u03c1). Density is an intrinsic property of a substance that describes how much matter is packed into a given three-dimensional space (\u03c1 = m/V). It is a measure of compactness, not of force distributed over an area. Although density is used in calculating fluid pressure (e.g., P = h\u03c1g), it is not the definition of pressure itself.\n\n**D. weight per unit volume**\nThis expression defines weight density, also known as specific weight (\u03b3). Weight is a force (W = mg), so weight density is the force of gravity on a substance per unit volume (\u03b3 = W/V). This quantity is distinct from pressure. While there is a relationship between the pressure exerted by a column of fluid and its weight density (P = \u03b3h, where h is the height of the column), the fundamental definition of pressure remains force per unit *area*, not force (or weight) per unit *volume*."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_415.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "15 a wooden cylinder floats partially submerged in a bath of water. a force f is applied to the\ncylinder until it is just fully submerged.\nwooden cylinder\nt\nwater f\nft\n| i)\ni |\ni l\nwhich statement is not correct?\na_ some of the water gains gravitational potential energy.\nb_ the cylinder loses gravitational potential energy.\nc_ work is done by force f on the cylinder.\nd_ work is done by the upthrust on the cylinder.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nWork is done by a force on an object when the object is displaced, and the work is calculated as the product of the force component in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of the displacement (W = Fd cos \u03b8). The upthrust on the cylinder is an upward-acting force. The cylinder, however, is displaced downwards. Since the force of upthrust and the displacement are in opposite directions, the angle \u03b8 between them is 180\u00b0. The cosine of 180\u00b0 is -1. Therefore, the work done *by* the upthrust is negative (W < 0). This means that work is done *against* the upthrust force. The statement \"Work is done by the upthrust\" implies that the upthrust performs positive work, which is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Options Explained:\n\n**A: Some of the water gains gravitational potential energy.**\nAs the cylinder is pushed further into the water, it displaces a greater volume of water. This additional displaced volume causes the overall water level in the bath to rise. The gravitational potential energy of an object is proportional to the height of its centre of mass (GPE = mgh). By raising the water level, the centre of mass of the water is elevated, resulting in an increase in the total gravitational potential energy of the water. Thus, this statement is correct.\n\n**B: The cylinder loses gravitational potential energy.**\nThe cylinder is pushed downwards, which means its vertical position decreases. The gravitational potential energy of the cylinder is dependent on its height (GPE = mgh). As the height (h) of the cylinder's centre of mass decreases, its gravitational potential energy also decreases. Therefore, the cylinder loses gravitational potential energy. This statement is correct.\n\n**C: Work is done by force F on the cylinder.**\nWork is done when a force causes displacement. The applied force F is directed downwards, and it causes the cylinder to be displaced downwards. Since the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work done by force F on the cylinder is positive (W = Fd).

The formula for GPE is *E<sub>p</sub> = mgh*, where *m* is the mass, *g* is the acceleration of free fall, and *h* is the height.\n\nThe rate of change of GPE is given by the change in GPE divided by the time taken, \u0394*t*. The problem states this rate is *R*.\n\n*R* = |\u0394*E<sub>p</sub>* / \u0394*t*| = |\u0394(*mgh*) / \u0394*t*|\n\nSince *m* and *g* are constants for the falling parachutist, we can write:\n\n*R* = *mg* |\u0394*h* / \u0394*t*|\n\nThe term |\u0394*h* / \u0394*t*| represents the magnitude of the rate of change of height, which is the vertical speed, *v*. Therefore, we can substitute *v* into the equation:\n\n*R* = *mgv*\n\nTo find the mass of the parachutist, *m*, we rearrange this equation:\n\n*m* = *R* / (*gv*)\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nAlternatively, consider the energy transformations. Since the parachutist is falling at a constant speed, her kinetic energy is not changing. According to the principle of conservation of energy, the gravitational potential energy being lost must be converted into another form. This conversion is due to the work done against air resistance, which dissipates the energy as heat. The rate of work done against air resistance is equal to the rate of GPE loss, *R*. The power (rate of work done) by the force of gravity is given by *P = Fv*, where *F* is the weight (*mg*) and *v* is the speed. Thus, *R = (mg)v*, which leads to the same result.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: gv / R**\nThis expression is the reciprocal of the correct answer. If we set *m = gv / R*, then by rearranging we get *R = gv / m*. This equation does not represent the rate of change of gravitational potential energy. A dimensional analysis also shows this option is incorrect: the units of *gv / R* would be (m s\u207b\u00b2) \u22c5 (m s\u207b\u00b9) / (J s\u207b\u00b9) = m\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b3 / (kg m\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b3), which simplifies to 1/kg, not kg.\n\n**C: 2R / v\u00b2**\nThis expression is derived from the formula for kinetic energy, *E<sub>k</sub> = \u00bdmv\u00b2*. If we rearrange this for mass, we get *m = 2E<sub>k</sub> / v\u00b2*. This option incorrectly equates the rate of energy loss, *R* (which has units of power, Watts or J/s), with an amount of energy, *E<sub>k</sub>* (which has units of Joules).

However, there is a likely error in the question, and option D actually represents the **potential energy (PE)** of the particle. Assuming this is a typo and the question intended to ask for potential energy, here is the explanation for why D is the correct representation of PE.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Potential Energy and Displacement:** For a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM), its potential energy is proportional to the square of its displacement from the equilibrium position (`PE \u221d x\u00b2`). The equilibrium position is where the displacement is zero.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Displacement-Time Graph:**\n    *   The given graph shows the particle's displacement (`x`) over time (`t`). It is a sinusoidal function, starting at `x = 0` at `t = 0`.\n    *   At `t = 0, T/2, T, 2T, ...`, the displacement `x` is zero. Therefore, the potential energy (`PE \u221d x\u00b2`) must also be zero at these times.\n    *   At `t = T/4, 3T/4, 5T/4, ...`, the displacement `x` is at its maximum value (amplitude). Therefore, the potential energy (`PE \u221d x\u00b2`) must be at its maximum at these times.\n\n3.  **Frequency of Energy Oscillation:**\n    *   Since `PE \u221d x\u00b2` and `x` is a sinusoidal function (like `sin(\u03c9t)`), the PE will be proportional to `sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)`.\n    *   A `sin\u00b2` function completes two full cycles in the same time it takes a `sin` function to complete one cycle. This means the frequency of the potential energy oscillation is double the frequency of the displacement oscillation, and its period is half (`T_PE = T/2`).\n\n4.  **Matching with Graph D:**\n    *   Graph D starts at zero energy at `t = 0`.\n    *   It reaches a maximum at `t = T/4`, returns to zero at `t = T/2`, reaches another maximum at `t = 3T/4`, and is zero again at `t = T`.\n    *   It completes two full cycles in the time interval from 0 to `2T`, meaning its period is `T`. Wait, looking again at the graph, it completes two full cycles between 0 and `T`, so its period is `T/2`. *Correction*: It completes two full cycles from 0 to T. This means its period is T/2.\n    *   This behaviour perfectly matches the derivation for potential energy (`PE \u221d sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)`).\n\nBased on this analysis, graph D correctly shows how the potential energy of the air particle varies with time. Given that D is the intended answer, it is most likely that the question mistakenly asked for kinetic energy instead of potential energy.\n\n### Explanation for Why Other Options are Incorrect\n\n*   **Option A:** This graph shows the energy having a period of `T`, the same as the displacement. The frequency of energy oscillation (both kinetic and potential) must be double the frequency of displacement, so the period should be `T/2`. Therefore, this graph has the incorrect frequency.\n\n*   **Option B:** This graph also shows an incorrect period of `T`. Furthermore, its shape does not correspond to the square of a sinusoidal function, which is characteristic of energy in SHM. The peaks are at `t=T/2` and `t=3T/2`, which does not match the requirements for either kinetic or potential energy for the given displacement.\n\n*   **Option C:** This graph correctly represents the **kinetic energy (KE)** of the particle. Kinetic energy (`KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2`) is maximum when the particle's speed is maximum, which occurs when it passes through the equilibrium position (`x = 0`). This happens at `t = 0, T/2, T, ...`. KE is zero when the particle is momentarily at rest at its maximum displacement (`t = T/4, 3T/4, ...`). Graph C shows maximum energy at `t = 0, T/2, T` and zero energy at `t = T/4, 3T/4`, with the correct period of `T/2`. Since the question asks for kinetic energy but the intended answer is D, option C is considered incorrect in the context of the question's provided solution."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_421.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 awave travels on the surface of water. p, q, r and s are four particles of water on the surface.\nthe diagram shows the positions of the particles at one instant. the direction of travel of the\nwave is from left to right.\n\ndirection of wave travel\noo\np\nq\nss\nwhich two particles are about to move upwards?\na pandr b pands c rands d qands", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis question assesses the understanding of particle motion in a transverse wave.

The magnitude of the Doppler shift is directly related to the speed of the source relative to the observer.

For all electromagnetic waves travelling in a vacuum, their velocity is a constant value, the speed of light, *c* (approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s). Therefore, the equation becomes *c* = *f\u03bb*. Since *c* is constant, if the frequency (*f*) increases, the wavelength (*\u03bb*) must decrease to keep their product constant, and vice versa. This relationship, where one variable decreases as the other increases, is an inverse proportionality. This can be expressed as *f* \u221d 1/*\u03bb*.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe velocity of all electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is the speed of light, *c*, which is a universal constant. The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement or disturbance of the medium from its equilibrium position; for an electromagnetic wave, it represents the maximum strength of the electric or magnetic field. The amplitude is related to the energy and intensity of the wave, not its velocity. A change in amplitude does not cause a change in the wave's velocity in a vacuum. Therefore, amplitude and velocity are independent quantities, not inversely proportional.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe intensity of a wave is defined as the power transmitted per unit area. For any wave, including electromagnetic waves, the intensity (*I*) is proportional to the square of its amplitude (*A*). This relationship is expressed as *I* \u221d *A*\u00b2. This means that if the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave is doubled, its intensity increases by a factor of four. The statement that intensity is directly proportional to amplitude (*I* \u221d *A*) is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nA key postulate of special relativity and a fundamental property of electromagnetism is that the speed of all electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is constant, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. This constant velocity is the speed of light, *c*. This means that all electromagnetic waves, from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency gamma rays, travel at the same speed in a vacuum.

It passes through the first filter, whose transmission axis is at 30\u00b0 to the vertical.\n*   Incident intensity, I_in = I\u2080\n*   Angle, \u03b8\u2081 = 30\u00b0\n\nThe intensity after the first filter, I\u2081, is:\nI\u2081 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(30\u00b0)\n\nThe wave emerging from the first filter is now polarised along its transmission axis, i.e., at 30\u00b0 to the vertical.\n\n**Step 2: After the second filter**\n\nThis newly polarised wave, with intensity I\u2081, is now incident on the second filter. The transmission axis of the second filter is at 90\u00b0 to the vertical.\n\nTo apply Malus's Law again, we need the angle between the polarisation of the wave incident on the second filter (30\u00b0 to the vertical) and the transmission axis of the second filter (90\u00b0 to the vertical).\n*   Angle, \u03b8\u2082 = 90\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 = 60\u00b0\n*   Incident intensity, I_in = I\u2081 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(30\u00b0)\n\nThe final intensity after the second filter, I\u2082, is:\nI\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8\u2082)\nI\u2082 = (I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(30\u00b0)) * cos\u00b2(60\u00b0)\n\nNow, we substitute the values for the cosine functions:\n*   cos(30\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2  => cos\u00b2(30\u00b0) = (\u221a3 / 2)\u00b2 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n*   cos(60\u00b0) = 1 / 2   => cos\u00b2(60\u00b0) = (1 / 2)\u00b2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equation for I\u2082:\nI\u2082 = I\u2080 * (0.75) * (0.25)\nI\u2082 = 0.1875 * I\u2080\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the final intensity is 0.19 I\u2080.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: 0\n\nThis answer would be correct if the transmission axis of a filter were perpendicular (at 90\u00b0) to the polarisation direction of the light incident upon it. In this scenario, the angle between the polarisation direction of the incident light and the second filter's transmission axis is 60\u00b0, not 90\u00b0. Therefore, the intensity is reduced but not completely blocked, making the final intensity non-zero.\n\n#### B: 0.063 I\u2080\n\nThis result is obtained if the angle for the first filter is incorrectly taken as 60\u00b0 instead of 30\u00b0. The calculation would be I\u2082 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(60\u00b0) * cos\u00b2(60\u00b0) = I\u2080 * (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625 I\u2080, which rounds to 0.063 I\u2080. This is incorrect because the problem explicitly states the angle between the initial vertical polarisation and the first filter is 30\u00b0.\n\n#### D: 0.56 I\u2080\n\nThis result is obtained from the calculation I\u2082 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(30\u00b0) * cos\u00b2(30\u00b0) = I\u2080 * (0.75) * (0.75) \u2248 0.56 I\u2080.

In a stationary wave, all particles within a single loop (i.e., between two adjacent nodes) oscillate in unison. They all reach their maximum displacement simultaneously, pass through their equilibrium positions at the same instant, and reach their maximum displacement in the opposite direction together. This synchronous motion means that all particles between two adjacent nodes are oscillating in phase with each other. Particles in an adjacent loop, however, will be oscillating in antiphase (180\u00b0 out of phase) with the particles in the first loop.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** A stationary wave results from the constructive and destructive interference of two constituent waves. At the antinodes, where constructive interference is maximum, the amplitude of the stationary wave is the sum of the amplitudes of the two individual waves. If each constituent wave has an amplitude of *A*, the amplitude at the antinodes of the stationary wave will be 2*A*. Therefore, the maximum amplitude of the stationary wave is twice the amplitude of one of the waves creating it, not equal to it.\n\n**C:** Nodes are points on a stationary wave that have zero amplitude. They are formed at locations where destructive interference is complete. The distance between any two consecutive nodes is exactly half a wavelength (\u03bb/2) of the constituent waves, not a full wavelength (\u03bb). A full wavelength is the distance between three consecutive nodes.\n\n**D:** This statement describes a node, not an antinode. An antinode is a point of maximum amplitude on a stationary wave. The particles at the antinodes undergo the largest possible oscillation, moving from a maximum positive displacement to a maximum negative displacement.

Diffraction is the process by which waves spread out as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle. For significant diffraction to occur, the size of the aperture must be comparable to the wavelength of the waves. The problem states the waves pass through a \"small gap,\" implying this condition is met.\n\nWhen plane waves pass through such a gap, they emerge as circular or, in this two-dimensional representation, semicircular waves, spreading out from the gap as if it were a point source.\n\nCrucially, as the waves diffract, their fundamental properties\u2014frequency, speed, and wavelength\u2014remain constant, provided the medium does not change. In this diagram, the spacing between the emergent semicircular wavefronts is the same as the spacing between the incident plane wavefronts, correctly indicating that the wavelength is unchanged.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer B\n\nThis diagram is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, it shows very little diffraction. The wavefronts remain largely planar after passing through the gap, with only slight curving at the edges. This pattern is characteristic of waves passing through a gap that is much *wider* than their wavelength, not a \"small gap\" as specified.\n\nSecondly, the diagram incorrectly shows a decrease in wavelength after the waves pass through the gap (the wavefronts are closer together). The wavelength of a wave is determined by its speed and frequency (\u03bb = v/f). Since the medium (water) does not change, the speed and frequency remain constant, and therefore the wavelength must also remain constant.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nThis diagram incorrectly depicts the effect of diffraction on wavelength. While it shows the waves spreading out, which is an aspect of diffraction, it illustrates a significant increase in the wavelength (the distance between consecutive wavefronts is larger) after the waves have passed through the gap.\n\nThe wavelength of a wave only changes if its speed or frequency changes. When a wave passes through an aperture into the same medium, neither its speed nor its frequency (which is determined by the source) is altered. Therefore, the wavelength must remain constant. This diagram violates this fundamental principle of wave motion.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows both an inaccurate diffraction pattern and an incorrect change in wavelength. The wavefronts are depicted as remaining mostly planar with some distortion, which does not accurately represent the significant spreading expected from a small gap.\n\nMore importantly, the diagram clearly shows an increase in the wavelength of the waves after they pass through the aperture (the wavefronts are spaced further apart). As the wave is propagating in the same medium (the ripple tank), its speed does not change. The frequency of the wave is also constant, as it is determined by the source. Consequently, the wavelength (\u03bb = v/f) must remain unchanged.

This means that if the potential difference across a component is 1 volt, then 1 joule of energy is converted from electrical potential energy into other forms (such as heat or light) for every coulomb of charge that flows through the component. Therefore, \"the energy transferred per unit charge\" is the correct definition of potential difference.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: the energy transferred per unit current**\nThis phrase describes the quantity E/I. Using the relationship for electrical energy, E = VIt (where V is potential difference, I is current, and t is time), the expression E/I simplifies to (VIt)/I = Vt. This quantity is the product of potential difference and time, which is not the definition of potential difference itself.\n\n**C: the power transferred per unit charge**\nThis phrase describes the quantity P/Q. Power (P) is the rate of energy transfer, so P = E/t. The expression P/Q can therefore be written as (E/t)/Q. Since potential difference V = E/Q, we can rearrange this to E = VQ.

While this equation is a valid way to calculate potential difference, it is a derived relationship, not the fundamental definition. The definition of potential difference (V = E/Q) is based on the more fundamental concepts of energy and charge.

The temperature of the filament increases.**\n\nAs the current (I) flowing through the filament increases, the rate at which electrical energy is converted into thermal energy (power dissipated) also increases, according to the formula P = I\u00b2R. This increased power dissipation causes a rapid rise in the temperature of the filament.\n\nFor a metallic conductor, such as the tungsten filament in a lamp, electrical resistance is dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, the positive ions within the metal's crystal lattice vibrate with greater amplitude and frequency. These more vigorous vibrations increase the frequency of collisions between the free-moving charge carriers (electrons) and the lattice ions. These collisions impede the overall flow of charge. Since resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow, this increased rate of collision results in an increase in the filament's resistance.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The charge of each charge carrier increases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The charge carriers in a metal filament are electrons. The charge of a single electron is a fundamental physical constant, known as the elementary charge (e \u2248 1.602 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C). This value does not change under any circumstances within the circuit. The increase in current is due to a greater number of charge carriers passing a point per unit time or an increase in their drift velocity, not an increase in the charge of each individual carrier.\n\n**B. The potential difference across the filament decreases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The relationship between potential difference (V), current (I), and resistance (R) is given by V = IR. The problem states that both the current (I) and the resistance (R) of the filament increase. Therefore, the potential difference (V) across the filament, being the product of two increasing quantities, must also increase. A decrease in potential difference would contradict the observed increase in both current and resistance.\n\n**C. The power dissipated by the filament decreases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The power (P) dissipated by the filament is given by P = I\u00b2R or P = VI. Since both current (I) and resistance (R) are increasing, the power dissipated must also increase.

The analysis involves two steps: first, determining the change in the thermistor's resistance and its relationship to temperature, and second, calculating the new resistance value.\n\n1.  **Temperature Change:** According to Ohm's Law (V = IR), for a constant electromotive force (e.m.f.) of 12 V, the total resistance (R_total) of the circuit is inversely proportional to the current (I). The problem states that the current increases from 0.10 A to 0.12 A. This means the total resistance of the circuit must have decreased. The total resistance is the sum of the fixed resistor (40 \u03a9) and the thermistor's resistance (R_T), as they are in series (R_total = 40 \u03a9 + R_T). Since the 40 \u03a9 resistor is fixed, the decrease in total resistance must be due to a decrease in the thermistor's resistance, R_T. For a standard thermistor (an NTC or Negative Temperature Coefficient type), a decrease in resistance corresponds to an increase in temperature.\n\n2.  **Calculation of New Resistance (R_T):**\n    *   First, calculate the new total resistance of the circuit using Ohm's Law with the new current:\n        R_total_new = V / I_new = 12 V / 0.12 A = 100 \u03a9.\n    *   Next, since the components are in series, subtract the resistance of the fixed resistor from the new total resistance to find the new resistance of the thermistor:\n        R_T_new = R_total_new - R_fixed = 100 \u03a9 - 40 \u03a9 = 60 \u03a9.\n\nThus, the temperature of the thermistor increases, and its new resistance is 60 \u03a9.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis answer is incorrect because a decrease in the temperature of a standard (NTC) thermistor would cause its resistance to increase. An increase in the thermistor's resistance would lead to an increase in the total circuit resistance. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), this would cause the current to decrease, which contradicts the information given that the current increased. While the calculated resistance value of 60 \u03a9 is correct, the associated temperature change is wrong.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis answer is incorrect because the value given for the thermistor's new resistance (R_T) is actually the new total resistance of the entire circuit. Using Ohm's Law with the new current (I = 0.12 A), the new total resistance is indeed R_total = V/I = 12 V / 0.12 A = 100 \u03a9. However, the question asks for the resistance of the thermistor (R_T) alone. To find this, the resistance of the fixed resistor (40 \u03a9) must be subtracted from the total resistance: R_T = 100 \u03a9 - 40 \u03a9 = 60 \u03a9. Although the temperature change is correctly identified as an increase, the resistance value is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis answer is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option B, a decrease in temperature would cause the thermistor's resistance to increase, leading to a decrease in the circuit's current, which is contrary to the problem statement.

It states that for any closed loop in an electrical circuit, the algebraic sum of the electromotive forces (e.m.f.s) is equal to the algebraic sum of the potential drops (p.d.s) around that loop.\n\nIn the given parallel circuit, we can identify several closed loops. Let's consider the loop that includes the cell and resistor R\u2081.\n- The e.m.f. supplied by the cell is V\u2080.\n- The potential drop across resistor R\u2081 is V\u2081.\nAccording to Kirchhoff's second law, for this loop:\nSum of e.m.f.s = Sum of p.d.s\nV\u2080 = V\u2081\n\nSimilarly, for the loop containing the cell and resistor R\u2082:\nV\u2080 = V\u2082\n\nAnd for the loop containing the cell and resistor R\u2083:\nV\u2080 = V\u2083\n\nBy combining these results, we establish that the potential difference across the cell is equal to the potential difference across each of the parallel branches. Therefore, V\u2080 = V\u2081 = V\u2082 = V\u2083. This is a fundamental property of parallel circuits and is derived directly from Kirchhoff's second law.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: I\u2080 = I\u2081 = I\u2082 = I\u2083**\nThis equation is incorrect. It describes the condition for a series circuit, where the same current flows through all components in the path. In a parallel circuit, the total current I\u2080 from the source is divided among the different parallel branches. Therefore, the currents I\u2081, I\u2082, and I\u2083 are generally not equal to each other or to the total current I\u2080 (unless the resistances are such that only one path exists).\n\n**B: I\u2080 = I\u2081 + I\u2082 + I\u2083**\nThis equation is a correct relationship for the given circuit, but it is derived from Kirchhoff's *first* law, not the second. Kirchhoff's first law, also known as the junction rule or current law, states that the sum of currents entering a junction must equal the sum of currents leaving it. At the junction where the main circuit splits into the three parallel branches, the incoming current is I\u2080 and the outgoing currents are I\u2081, I\u2082, and I\u2083. Thus, I\u2080 = I\u2081 + I\u2082 + I\u2083. Since the question specifically asks for an equation obtained from Kirchhoff's second law, this option is not the correct answer.\n\n**D: V\u2080 = V\u2081 + V\u2082 + V\u2083**\nThis equation is incorrect. It describes the relationship for potential differences across components connected in *series*. In a series circuit, the total potential difference across the combination is the sum of the individual potential differences.

In a series connection, the total resistance would be the sum of the three individual resistances: *R_total* = *R* + *R* + *R* = 3*R*. If 3*R* = 8.0 \u03a9, then *R* would be 8.0/3 \u2248 2.67 \u03a9. However, the circuit diagram clearly shows a combination of series and parallel connections, not a simple series circuit.\n\n#### B: 4.0 \u03a9\nThis result arises from considering only the bottom branch and ignoring the top parallel branch. If the total resistance were just the resistance of the two series resistors in the bottom branch, then *R_total* = *R* + *R* = 2*R*. Setting 2*R* = 8.0 \u03a9 would give *R* = 4.0 \u03a9. This is incorrect because the top resistor is in parallel, and its presence reduces the total equivalent resistance of the network.\n\n#### C: 5.3 \u03a9\nThis value is the result of misinterpreting the circuit's configuration. For instance, if one assumed that the top resistor was in series with a parallel combination of the two bottom resistors, the calculation would be incorrect. A parallel combination of two resistors *R* would be *R*/2, and adding the third resistor in series would give a total resistance of *R* + *R*/2 = 3*R*/2. Setting 3*R*/2 = 8.0 \u03a9 would yield *R* = 16/3 \u2248 5.3 \u03a9.

The resistance per unit length of the wire QR must be constant.**\n\nThis is the correct answer. The fundamental principle of a potentiometer is that the potential difference across any segment of the resistance wire is directly proportional to the length of that segment. This principle relies on the wire having a uniform potential gradient.\n\nA uniform potential gradient is established when a constant current flows through a wire of uniform resistivity and uniform cross-sectional area. Such a wire has a constant resistance per unit length. If the resistance per unit length is constant, the potential difference (V) across a length (l) of the wire is given by V = kl, where k is the constant potential gradient.\n\nAt the balance point, the potential difference across the length QP is equal to the e.m.f. of the new cell (E_new). Thus, E_new = k \u00d7 (length QP). If the wire is not uniform (i.e., its resistance per unit length is not constant), the potential gradient will vary along the wire. In this case, the potential difference would not be directly proportional to the length, and the measurement of the e.m.f. based on the balance length would be inaccurate.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The e.m.f. of the driver cell must be less than the e.m.f. of the new cell.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. For a balance point to be found on the wire QR, the potential difference provided by the driver cell across the wire must be capable of matching the e.m.f. of the new cell. The maximum potential difference that can be tapped from the potentiometer wire is the potential difference across its entire length (QR), which is approximately equal to the e.m.f. of the driver cell, E.\n\nIf the e.m.f. of the driver cell (E) were less than the e.m.f. of the new cell, the maximum potential difference across the wire would be insufficient to balance the e.m.f. of the new cell. Consequently, a null point could not be found anywhere along the wire. The essential requirement is the opposite: the e.m.f. of the driver cell must be greater than the e.m.f. of the cell being measured.\n\n**B. The galvanometer must have a large resistance.**\n\nThis is not an essential requirement for accuracy. The function of the galvanometer is to detect the absence of current at the balance point (the null point). The crucial characteristic for this purpose is sensitivity\u2014the ability to detect very small currents. A highly sensitive galvanometer allows for a more precise location of the null point, thereby increasing the accuracy of the measurement. While a large resistance can help protect the galvanometer from damage by limiting the current when the circuit is far from balance, it is the sensitivity, not the magnitude of its resistance, that is essential for an accurate measurement.\n\n**C. The internal resistance of the new cell must be zero.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A key advantage of using a potentiometer to measure e.m.f. is that the measurement is taken at the null point, where no current is drawn from the cell being tested. The terminal potential difference (V) of a cell is given by V = E - Ir, where E is the e.m.f., I is the current, and r is the internal resistance. At the balance point, the current (I) is zero. Therefore, the terminal potential difference becomes equal to the e.m.f. (V = E). Because the measurement method inherently eliminates the effect of the internal resistance, the value of the internal resistance does not affect the accuracy of the measured e.m.f."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_438.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 the table shows the number of nucleons and the total number of particles (protons, neutrons and\nelectrons) in neutral atoms of four nuclides w, x, y and z.\n| a |\nnucleons of particles\n\nwww 19 30\n\nxx 19 31\n\n\u00a5 21 32\n\nz 22 31\nwhich two nuclides are isotopes of each other?\na wandx b wandyy c xandz d yandz", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: B\n\nIsotopes are defined as nuclides of the same chemical element that have the same number of protons (atomic number, Z) but different numbers of neutrons.

A parent nucleus decays into a daughter nucleus and an alpha particle. According to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value) is distributed between these two particles in a fixed and predictable way. Since the masses of the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle are constant, the kinetic energy of the emitted alpha particle will always have a specific, discrete value for a given decay.\n\nBeta-minus (\u03b2\u207b) decay, however, is a three-body process. A neutron in the parent nucleus decays into a proton (which remains in the nucleus), a beta particle (an electron), and an electron antineutrino. The Q-value for this decay is shared among the daughter nucleus, the beta particle, and the antineutrino. The energy can be distributed in a variable manner between the beta particle and the antineutrino. The beta particle can carry away any amount of kinetic energy from nearly zero up to a maximum value (equal to the Q-value, minus the small recoil energy of the nucleus). The antineutrino carries away the remaining energy. Because this energy sharing is variable, the emitted beta particles have a continuous range of energies, not a single discrete energy.\n\nTherefore, the emission of an antineutrino alongside the \u03b2\u207b particle is the correct explanation for its continuous energy spectrum.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: An antineutrino is emitted with an \u03b1-particle but not with a \u03b2\u207b particle.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Antineutrinos are emitted during \u03b2\u207b decay to conserve fundamental physical quantities like lepton number. Alpha decay does not involve the emission of neutrinos or antineutrinos as it is governed by the strong nuclear force, not the weak nuclear force which mediates beta decay.\n\n**C: The \u03b1-particles have much more energy than the \u03b2\u207b particles.**\nWhile it is often the case that alpha particles are emitted with higher energies (typically in the MeV range) than the average energy of beta particles, this is not the reason for the difference in their energy spectra. The question is about why one spectrum is discrete and the other is continuous. The relative magnitude of the energies does not explain the fundamental nature of the energy distribution. The type of spectrum (discrete or continuous) is determined by the number of particles involved in the decay, not by the total energy released.\n\n**D: The \u03b2\u207b particles have much more energy than the \u03b1-particles.**\nThis statement is generally factually incorrect; \u03b1-particles typically carry more kinetic energy than \u03b2\u207b-particles. Furthermore, as with option C, the magnitude of the particles' energy does not explain why the energy spectrum of beta particles is continuous while that of alpha particles is discrete.

Pressure is defined as force per unit area (P = F/A). The SI base units for force are kg m s\u207b\u00b2, and the SI base units for area are m\u00b2.

The spring constant is defined from Hooke's Law as the force per unit extension (k = F/x). The SI base units for force are kg m s\u207b\u00b2, and for extension (a distance) are m.

Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object's mass. As a force, it inherently possesses both a magnitude (measured in Newtons) and a specific direction (acting vertically downwards towards the center of the Earth). Because weight has both these properties, it is correctly classified as a vector quantity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Acceleration of free fall is a vector quantity because it has a constant magnitude.**\nThis statement provides an incorrect reason. While the acceleration of free fall *is* a vector quantity, it is a vector because it has both magnitude (approximately 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2) and direction (downwards). The defining characteristic of a vector is the presence of direction, not the constancy of its magnitude. Many vector quantities, such as the velocity of a car turning a corner, have a changing magnitude or direction. Therefore, the justification that it is a vector *because* its magnitude is constant is incorrect.\n\n**B. Temperature in \u00b0C is a vector quantity because it can be positive or negative.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Temperature is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. The fact that a temperature value can be positive or negative (e.g., 20\u00b0C or -5\u00b0C) simply relates its value to a zero point on a defined scale (the freezing point of water for Celsius). It does not imply a spatial direction, which is a necessary component of a vector quantity.\n\n**C. Time is a vector quantity because it can only go in the forwards direction.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Time is a scalar quantity. It has magnitude (e.g., 30 seconds) but no direction in space. The concept of time moving \"forwards\" (the arrow of time) is not a spatial direction like north, up, or along an x-axis. A vector must have a direction that can be represented within a spatial coordinate system.

It may arise from mistakenly using the absolute uncertainty of one of the length measurements (0.01 cm) as the final uncertainty, without correctly applying the rules for uncertainty propagation. When calculating a value from multiple measurements, the uncertainties of all measurements must be combined. The correct procedure involves summing the fractional uncertainties of all quantities, not just using a single value.\n\n#### B: \u00b1 0.02 g cm\u207b\u00b3\nThis answer is incorrect. It is likely the result of a miscalculation, such as omitting one of the component fractional uncertainties or using an incorrect value.

The correct method requires summing the fractional uncertainties of all four measured quantities (mass, length, width, and height).\n\n#### D: \u00b1 0.13 g cm\u207b\u00b3\nThis answer is incorrect. It results from a common misconception: adding the absolute uncertainties of the measurements (0.1 g + 0.01 cm + 0.01 cm + 0.01 cm = 0.13). This is fundamentally incorrect because absolute uncertainties can only be added when the quantities themselves are being added or subtracted.

The only force acting on the object after projection is the force of gravity, which acts vertically downwards. According to Newton's second law (F=ma), this constant downward force produces a constant downward acceleration, *g* (the acceleration due to free fall).\n\nSince there is a constant vertical acceleration, the vertical component of the velocity changes continuously throughout the flight. The initial vertical velocity is *u*sin*\u03b8*. It decreases as the object rises, becomes zero at the maximum height, and then increases in the downward direction until the object hits the ground. The equation for the vertical velocity *v_y* at a time *\u03c4* is given by *v_y* = *u*sin*\u03b8* - *g\u03c4*. Because *v_y* changes with time, this statement is an incorrect description of the motion.\n\n---\n#### **Incorrect Options**\n\n*   **A: The horizontal component of the object's velocity is constant and has the value *u*cos*\u03b8*.**\n    This statement is a correct description of the motion. Since air resistance is negligible, there are no forces acting in the horizontal direction. With no horizontal force, the horizontal acceleration is zero.

This force always acts vertically downwards from the object's centre of mass. All diagrams correctly depict this force.\n\n2.  **Force from the ground (R):** The problem states the ground is \"icy (frictionless)\". A frictionless surface can only exert a force that is perpendicular to the surface. This is known as the normal reaction force. Since the ground is horizontal, the force R must be purely vertical and directed upwards.\n\n3.  **Force from the wall (P):** The problem states the wall is \"rough\". This means the wall can exert both a normal reaction force and a frictional force.\n    *   The **normal reaction force** component is perpendicular to the wall. As the wall is vertical, this force acts horizontally, pushing the ladder to the right.\n    *   The **frictional force** component opposes the motion or tendency of motion. As the ladder \"begins to slide\", its top end moves downwards along the wall. Therefore, the frictional force exerted by the wall on the ladder is directed upwards.\n    *   The total force P is the vector sum of the horizontal normal force (to the right) and the upward frictional force. The resultant of these two perpendicular vectors is a force directed upwards and to the right.\n\nDiagram B correctly shows the weight (W) acting downwards, the force from the frictionless ground (R) acting vertically upwards, and the total force from the rough wall (P) acting upwards and to the right.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer A\n\nIn this diagram, the force from the wall (P) is shown acting purely horizontally. This would only represent the normal reaction force from the wall. However, the problem specifies that the wall is \"rough\". As the ladder slides, its top end moves downwards against the wall. A rough surface will exert a frictional force opposing this motion, which would be directed upwards. Therefore, the total force P from the wall should be the resultant of the horizontal normal force and the upward frictional force, meaning it should have both a horizontal and a vertical component. This diagram incorrectly omits the upward frictional component of force P.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nThis diagram incorrectly depicts the force from the ground (R). The problem states that the ground is \"icy (frictionless)\". A frictionless surface can only exert a normal reaction force, which is always perpendicular to the surface. For the horizontal ground, this force must be directed vertically upwards. Diagram C shows the force R as a tilted vector, which implies it has both a vertical (normal) component and a horizontal (frictional) component. Since the ground is frictionless, it cannot exert a horizontal frictional force. Therefore, the direction of R is incorrect. Additionally, the force from the wall (P) is shown incorrectly for the same reasons as in option A.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThis diagram incorrectly depicts the force from the ground (R). The ground is stated to be \"frictionless\". A force from a frictionless surface must be a normal reaction force, acting perpendicular to that surface.

Terminal velocity is the constant velocity reached by a falling object when the force of air resistance equals the force of gravity. At this point, the net force on the object is zero, and it no longer accelerates, thus moving at a constant velocity.\n\nOn a distance-time graph, a constant velocity is shown as a straight line with a constant, positive gradient. Region B of the graph is a straight line, indicating that the distance travelled increases linearly with time. This signifies that the parachute is moving at a constant velocity. Therefore, region B represents the period when the parachute is falling at its terminal velocity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A\n\nIn region A, the graph is a curve with an increasing gradient. The gradient of a distance-time graph represents velocity. An increasing gradient means that the velocity of the parachute is increasing. This shows the parachute is accelerating from rest due to gravity, and the opposing force of air resistance has not yet become large enough to balance the gravitational force. This phase of acceleration occurs before terminal velocity is reached.\n\n#### C\n\nThe label C marks a single point in time where the motion of the parachute changes. It is the end of the period of constant velocity (terminal velocity) and the beginning of the period where the parachute comes to rest. Velocity is a measure of motion over an interval of time, so a single point cannot represent the state of moving at terminal velocity.\n\n#### D\n\nIn region D, the graph is a horizontal line. A horizontal line on a distance-time graph has a gradient of zero. Since the gradient represents velocity, a zero gradient indicates that the velocity of the parachute is zero. This means the parachute has stopped moving, which would happen after it has landed on the ground. This is a state of being at rest, not moving at terminal velocity."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_450.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "10 a lift (elevator) consists of a passenger car supported by a cable that runs over a light, frictionless\npulley to a counterbalance. the counterbalance falls as the passenger car rises.\ns pulley\nnot to scale\ncounterbalance p\npassenger car\nq\nfs\ni\nsome masses are shown in the table.\ntass\npassenger car 520\ncounterbalance 640\npassenger 80\nwhat is the magnitude of the acceleration of the car when carrying just one passenger and when\nthe pulley is free to rotate?\na 0.032ms\u201d b 0.32ms\u201d c 0.61ms? d 0.65ms?", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Rationale for the Correct Answer (B)\n\nThis problem can be solved by applying Newton's Second Law of Motion to the elevator system.

This error likely arises from correctly calculating the speed `v` from the conservation of momentum in the y-direction but then mistaking this intermediate value for the final answer, `u`. The question asks for the initial velocity `u` of the first disc, not the final velocity `v` of the second disc.\n\n#### B: 1.4 m s\u207b\u00b9\nThis answer is not obtainable through the correct application of the conservation of momentum. It likely results from an algebraic or conceptual mistake. For example, if one were to incorrectly set the initial momentum `Mu` equal to only the final momentum of the smaller mass, `M(4.0)`, and then multiply by an incorrect trigonometric factor, a wrong answer might be produced. Correctly applying the principle requires summing the momentum components of *both* discs after the collision.\n\n#### C: 3.5 m s\u207b\u00b9\nThis incorrect value arises from a common conceptual error in applying the conservation of momentum in the x-direction. If one forgets to include the mass `4M` for the second disc in the momentum equation and instead uses `M` for both, the equation becomes:\n`M * u = M * (4.0 * cos(45\u00b0)) + M * (v * cos(45\u00b0))`\n`u = (4.0 + v) * cos(45\u00b0)`\nSubstituting `v = 1.0 m s\u207b\u00b9` gives:\n`u = (4.0 + 1.0) * cos(45\u00b0) = 5.0 * cos(45\u00b0) \u2248 3.54 m s\u207b\u00b9`\nThis is incorrect because the momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity (`p = mv`).

Since the object is dropped from rest, the initial speed `u` is zero. The acceleration `a` is the acceleration of free fall `g`, and the displacement `s` is the height `h`. Thus, the equation simplifies to `v\u00b2 = 2gh`, which gives the final speed as `v = \u221a(2gh)`.\n\nLet `v_E`, `g_E`, and `h_E` be the final speed, acceleration of free fall, and height on Earth, respectively.\nLet `v_M`, `g_M`, and `h_M` be the corresponding values for the Moon.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   `h_E = 2.0 m`\n*   `h_M = 2 * h_E`\n*   `g_M = 0.16 * g_E`\n\nThe ratio required is `v_E / v_M`.

The formula for upthrust is U = \u03c1_fluid * V_submerged * g, where \u03c1_fluid is the density of the fluid, V_submerged is the volume of the object submerged in the fluid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n    In this problem, the sphere is initially held *completely immersed* in water. As it rises towards the surface, it remains completely immersed. The volume of the sphere (and thus the volume of water it displaces, V_submerged) is constant. The problem states that the density of the water (\u03c1_fluid) is uniform. Since \u03c1_fluid, V_submerged, and g are all constant, the upthrust on the sphere remains **constant** as long as it is fully submerged.\n\n2.  **Resultant force on the sphere:**\n    The resultant force on the sphere is the vector sum of all forces acting on it. The forces are:\n    *   **Upthrust (U):** Acting upwards (constant, as explained above).\n    *   **Weight (W):** Acting downwards (constant, as the mass of the sphere is constant).\n    *   **Drag Force (D):** A resistive force that opposes motion. Since the sphere is rising, the drag force acts downwards. The magnitude of the drag force increases as the speed of the sphere increases.\n\n    The net or resultant force is given by: F_resultant = U - W - D.\n    Since the sphere is less dense than water, the upthrust (U) is greater than its weight (W). When released from rest, there is an initial upward resultant force (F = U - W, since D=0 at v=0), which causes the sphere to accelerate upwards.\n\n    As the sphere accelerates, its upward speed increases. The increasing speed causes the downward drag force (D) to increase. Since U and W are constant, and the downward drag force D is increasing, the overall upward resultant force (F_resultant = U - W - D) must be **decreasing**. This continues until the sphere reaches terminal velocity, at which point the resultant force becomes zero (U = W + D).\n\nTherefore, the upthrust is constant, and the resultant force is decreasing.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B (constant, increasing):** The upthrust is correctly identified as constant. However, the resultant force is decreasing, not increasing. An increasing resultant force would imply that the sphere's acceleration is increasing, but the presence of a drag force that grows with speed ensures that the net force (and thus acceleration) decreases as the sphere speeds up.\n\n*   **C (decreasing, decreasing):** The resultant force is correctly identified as decreasing. However, the upthrust is constant, not decreasing. The upthrust would only decrease if the sphere started to emerge from the water's surface, reducing the volume of displaced water.

This is known as the principle of moments, which states that for equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about a pivot must equal the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot.\n\nLet's choose the hinge on the wall as the pivot. This choice is strategic because the reaction force at the hinge passes through the pivot, creating zero moment, and thus it does not need to be included in our calculations.\n\n1.  **Clockwise Moment:** The weight of the uniform bar (W = 200 N) acts at its center of mass. For a 4.0 m uniform bar, the center of mass is at a distance of 4.0 m / 2 = 2.0 m from the hinge. This weight creates a clockwise moment.\n    *   Clockwise Moment = Force \u00d7 Perpendicular distance\n    *   Clockwise Moment = W \u00d7 2.0 m = 200 N \u00d7 2.0 m = 400 Nm.\n\n2.  **Anticlockwise Moment:** The tension (T) in the cable pulls at an angle. Only the component of the tension perpendicular to the bar creates a moment. This component is T sin(35\u00b0). The cable is attached at a distance of 0.50 m from the far end, which is 4.0 m - 0.50 m = 3.5 m from the hinge. This creates an anticlockwise moment.\n    *   Anticlockwise Moment = (Perpendicular Force Component) \u00d7 Perpendicular distance\n    *   Anticlockwise Moment = (T sin(35\u00b0)) \u00d7 3.5 m.\n\n3.  **Equating Moments:** According to the principle of moments:\n    *   Sum of anticlockwise moments = Sum of clockwise moments\n    *   (T sin(35\u00b0)) \u00d7 3.5 = 400\n\n4.  **Solving for T:**\n    *   T = 400 / (3.5 \u00d7 sin(35\u00b0))\n    *   T = 400 / (3.5 \u00d7 0.5736)\n    *   T = 400 / 2.0076\n    *   T \u2248 199.2 N\n\nThis value is approximately 200 N.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 140 N**\nThis incorrect answer is obtained by mistakenly using the horizontal component of the tension (T cos(35\u00b0)) instead of the vertical component (T sin(35\u00b0)) when calculating the anticlockwise moment. The moment is produced by the component of the force that is perpendicular to the lever arm (the bar). The horizontal component of the tension is parallel to the bar and thus creates no turning effect (zero moment) about the hinge.\n\n**B: 170 N**\nThis value results from an error in identifying the lever arm for the tension force. It is calculated by assuming the cable is attached at the very end of the bar (4.0 m from the hinge), instead of the correct distance of 3.5 m. The problem states the cable is attached 0.50 m from the other end, so its distance from the hinge is 4.0 m - 0.50 m = 3.5 m. Using the incorrect distance of 4.0 m would give T = 400 / (4.0 \u00d7 sin(35\u00b0)) \u2248 174 N.\n\n**D: 400 N**\nThis incorrect value arises from using the full length of the bar (4.0 m) as the lever arm for the weight, instead of the distance to the center of mass (2.0 m). For a uniform bar, the entire weight is considered to act at its geometric center. Therefore, the clockwise moment is 200 N \u00d7 2.0 m = 400 Nm, not 200 N \u00d7 4.0 m = 800 Nm. Using the incorrect moment of 800 Nm would lead to a tension of T = 800 / (3.5 \u00d7 sin(35\u00b0)) \u2248 398 N."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_457.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "17 the diagrams all show a pair of equal forces acting on a metre rule.\nwhich diagram shows forces that provide a couple and zero resultant force?\na b c d", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA couple is defined as a pair of forces that are equal in magnitude, parallel, but opposite in direction, and act along different lines of action. The effect of a couple is to produce a pure turning moment, or torque, without causing any translational acceleration.\n\nFor the resultant force to be zero, the vector sum of all forces acting on the object must be zero. For a pair of forces, this means they must be equal in magnitude and point in exactly opposite directions.\n\nIn diagram B, the two forces shown are equal in magnitude and act in opposite directions (one upwards, one downwards). This satisfies the condition for a zero resultant force. Furthermore, the forces are parallel and act on different points of the metre rule, meaning they have different lines of action. This configuration precisely matches the definition of a couple. Therefore, these forces provide both a couple and a zero resultant force.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** The two forces are equal in magnitude and parallel, but they act in the same direction (both downwards). Consequently, the resultant force is non-zero; it is the sum of the two forces, directed downwards. Since the forces are not in opposite directions, they do not form a couple.\n\n**C:** The two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so the resultant force is zero. However, they both act along the same line of action. A couple requires the forces to be separated by a perpendicular distance, meaning they must have different lines of action. As these forces are collinear, they cancel each other out completely, producing no turning effect (zero torque). Thus, they do not form a couple.\n\n**D:** The two forces are stated to be equal in magnitude, but they are not parallel and do not act in opposite directions. The vertical components of the forces are not equal, and there is a horizontal component from the angled force that is unopposed. Therefore, the vector sum of these forces is not zero, and there is a non-zero resultant force.

For the gravitational force, which is constant and acts vertically downwards, the work done depends only on the vertical displacement of the object.\n\nThe formula for the work done by gravity (W_g) is given by:\nW_g = -\u0394PE_g = -(PE_f - PE_i)\nwhere \u0394PE_g is the change in gravitational potential energy, PE_f is the final potential energy, and PE_i is the initial potential energy.\n\nIn this scenario, the ball starts at point P and ends at point Q. According to the diagram, points P and Q are at the same horizontal level. This means the initial height and the final height of the ball are the same. If we set the reference level for potential energy at the ground (h=0), then:\n- Initial potential energy at P, PE_i = mg(0) = 0\n- Final potential energy at Q, PE_f = mg(0) = 0\n\nTherefore, the change in potential energy is:\n\u0394PE_g = PE_f - PE_i = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nThe total work done by the gravitational force is:\nW_g = -\u0394PE_g = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can consider the two parts of the flight.\n1.  **From P to the maximum height h:** The displacement is upwards, while the gravitational force (mg) is downwards. The work done by gravity is negative: W_up = -mgh.\n2.  **From the maximum height h to Q:** The displacement is downwards, in the same direction as the gravitational force. The work done by gravity is positive: W_down = +mgh.\n\nThe total work done during the flight from P to Q is the sum of the work done in both parts:\nW_total = W_up + W_down = -mgh + mgh = 0.\n\nSince the net vertical displacement is zero, the total work done by the gravitational force is zero.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: \u00bd*mv*\u00b2**\nThis expression, \u00bd*mv*\u00b2, represents the initial kinetic energy of the ball at point P. The work-energy theorem states that the *net* work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy (\u0394KE). Since the ball starts at P and lands at Q at the same height, and air resistance is negligible, its speed at Q will be the same as its initial speed *v*. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is \u0394KE = KE_final - KE_initial = \u00bd*mv*\u00b2 - \u00bd*mv*\u00b2 = 0. This means the net work done is zero, which is consistent with the correct answer. However, the initial kinetic energy itself is not the work done by the gravitational force over the entire flight.\n\n**C: *mgh***\nThe term *mgh* represents the gravitational potential energy gained by the ball when it moves from its initial level to its maximum height, *h*. It is also equal to the magnitude of the work done by gravity during the ascent (W_up = -*mgh*) and the magnitude of the work done during the descent (W_down = +*mgh*). The question asks for the *total* work done over the entire flight from P to Q. This requires summing the work done during both the upward and downward motions. The negative work done during the ascent is cancelled by the positive work done during the descent, resulting in a total work of zero, not *mgh*.\n\n**D: 2*mgh***\nThis value is incorrect and does not represent a meaningful physical quantity in this context. It might arise from a misunderstanding of how to calculate total work, for instance, by incorrectly adding the magnitudes of the work done during ascent and descent (|*-mgh*| + |*mgh*| = 2*mgh). Work is a scalar quantity but has a sign indicating whether energy is added to or removed from the system by the force. The total work is the algebraic sum of the work done during each phase of the motion (-*mgh* + *mgh*), which equals zero."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_459.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "19 a spring of spring constant 30nm\u201c* is suspended vertically from its top. the spring obeys\nhooke\u2019s law. initially the spring is not compressed and not stretched. a mass of 0.50kg is\nattached to the bottom of the spring. the mass is released from rest and falls.\n\nfrictional effects are negligible.\nin the motion that follows, what is the maximum extension of the spring?\na 0.017m b 0.033m c 0.16m d 0.33m", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThis problem is solved by applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.

This expression is dimensionally incorrect for a length. The units would be kg / (N m\u207b\u00b9) = kg m N\u207b\u00b9 = kg m (kg m s\u207b\u00b2)\u207b\u00b9 = s\u00b2, which is a unit of time squared, not distance. This calculation does not represent a physical principle applicable to this situation.\n\n#### B: 0.033 m\nThis value is twice the value in option A, corresponding to the incorrect calculation of `2m/k = 2 * 0.50 / 30 \u2248 0.033`. Similar to option A, this formula is dimensionally incorrect (units of s\u00b2) and does not correspond to the physical principles governing the motion of a mass on a spring.\n\n#### C: 0.16 m\nThis is a common misconception. This value represents the extension of the spring when the mass is hanging in **static equilibrium**, not the maximum extension after being dropped.\n\nAt equilibrium, the net force on the mass is zero. The upward spring force (`F_s = kx_eq`) balances the downward gravitational force (weight, `W = mg`).\n`kx_eq = mg`\n`x_eq = mg / k = (0.50 kg * 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2) / 30 N m\u207b\u00b9 = 0.1635 m \u2248 0.16 m`.\n\nHowever, when the mass is released from the unstretched position, it accelerates downwards, gaining kinetic energy. It passes through the equilibrium position with maximum speed. Due to its inertia, it continues to move downwards, stretching the spring further, until its kinetic energy is fully converted into potential energy (both elastic and gravitational). The lowest point it reaches corresponds to the maximum extension, which is twice the equilibrium extension (`x_max = 2x_eq`)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_460.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "20 a wire has original length l and cross-sectional area a. a tensile force f is applied to the wire\nwhich causes it to have extension x. the wire obeys hooke\u2019s law.\nwhat is an expression for the young modulus of the material from which the wire is made?\na stress x xx b a cc fxx d strain\nl ax strain axl stress", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe Young modulus (E) is a property of a material that measures its stiffness.

Therefore, this expression is correct.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: (stress \u00d7 x) / L**\nThis expression is incorrect. We know that strain is defined as \u03b5 = x / L. Therefore, the extension x can be written as x = \u03b5 \u00d7 L. Substituting this into the given expression gives: (stress \u00d7 (\u03b5 \u00d7 L)) / L = stress \u00d7 \u03b5.

The graph shows that the relationship between force and extension is linear up to point Q. This point, where the graph deviates from a straight line, is known as the **limit of proportionality**. Beyond this point, Hooke's Law (force is directly proportional to extension) is no longer obeyed.\n\nThe **elastic limit** is the maximum extent to which a solid may be stretched without permanent alteration of size or shape. While for some materials the elastic limit and the limit of proportionality are very close, they are distinct concepts. It is possible for a material to be stretched beyond its limit of proportionality but still be within its elastic limit, meaning it will return to its original length when the force is removed. Therefore, we can only be certain that Q is the limit of proportionality, not the elastic limit.\n\n---\n**B: Point R is the limit of proportionality.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The **limit of proportionality** is the point on a force-extension graph up to which the extension of the material is directly proportional to the applied force. This corresponds to the region where the graph is a straight line passing through the origin.\n\nObserving the graph, the linear relationship holds from the origin (O) up to point Q. After point Q, the graph begins to curve, indicating that force and extension are no longer proportional. Point R lies on this curved section, well beyond the limit of proportionality. Therefore, point Q, not point R, represents the limit of proportionality.\n\n---\n**C: The area under the graph from P to S is the elastic potential energy stored in the wire.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The area under a force-extension graph represents the work done on the wire. This work done is stored as **elastic potential energy** only if the deformation is entirely elastic (i.e., the wire can return to its original length).\n\nThe section of the graph from Q to S is non-linear, which shows the wire has been stretched beyond its limit of proportionality. It is highly likely that it has also been stretched beyond its elastic limit, causing plastic (permanent) deformation. When a material is plastically deformed, some of the work done is converted into internal energy (dissipated as heat) to move atoms to new permanent positions, and is not stored as recoverable elastic potential energy. Therefore, the area under the graph represents the total work done, not purely the elastic potential energy stored.\n\n---\n**D: The area under the graph from P to S is the work done in stretching the wire.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Work is done when a force causes displacement. For a variable force, the work done can be calculated by finding the area under the force-displacement graph. In this context, the y-axis represents force and the x-axis represents extension (which is a displacement).\n\nTherefore, the area under the force-extension graph is a direct measure of the work done on the wire to cause it to stretch. This principle is fundamental and applies to the entire process, regardless of whether the deformation is elastic or plastic. The area under the curve between any two points on the extension axis represents the work done to stretch the wire over that interval.

The wavelength (\u03bb) is the spatial period of the wave, which is the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. By observing the graph, we can see that one complete cycle of the wave, for example, from one crest to the next, occurs over a distance of 4.0 cm. The wave is at a maximum positive displacement near x=0 and at the next maximum positive displacement at x=4.0 cm. Therefore, the wavelength \u03bb = 4.0 cm. To use this in the wave speed equation, it must be converted to standard units (metres): \u03bb = 0.040 m.\n\n2.  **Determine the Frequency (f):** The problem states that the period of the wave (T) is 91 ms. The frequency (f) is the reciprocal of the period. First, convert the period to seconds: T = 91 ms = 91 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 s = 0.091 s. Then, calculate the frequency:\n    f = 1 / T = 1 / 0.091 s \u2248 10.99 Hz, which rounds to 11 Hz.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Wave Velocity (v):** The velocity of a progressive wave is given by the wave equation, v = f\u03bb.

The velocity of 0.55 m s\u207b\u00b9 would be correct if the wavelength were 5.0 cm (v = 11 Hz \u00d7 0.050 m = 0.55 m s\u207b\u00b9), but since the premise (the wavelength) is wrong, the entire statement is incorrect.\n\n*   **C: It is longitudinal and has a frequency of 11 Hz.**\n    While the frequency is correctly calculated as 11 Hz, the type of wave cannot be determined from a displacement-distance graph alone. Such a graph can represent either a transverse wave (where displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation) or a longitudinal wave (where displacement is parallel to the direction of propagation). Since there is no information to distinguish between these two types, it cannot be concluded that the wave is longitudinal. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily correct.\n\n*   **D: It is transverse and has a wavelength of 4.0 cm.**\n    This statement correctly identifies the wavelength as 4.0 cm from the graph. However, for the same reason as in option C, the graph does not provide sufficient information to determine that the wave is transverse. A displacement-distance graph is a general representation and does not specify the orientation of the displacement relative to the direction of wave travel.

The period, calculated as T = 1/f, is 0.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 s. Since the prefix 'nano' (n) represents 10\u207b\u2079, the period in nanoseconds is 0.2 ns. The value 2 ns is ten times larger than the correct period.

The correct period is 0.2 ns (0.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 s). The value 20 ns is one hundred times larger than the correct period.

The phase of a wave changes with time. If two waves have different frequencies, their relative phase will also change continuously with time. This means their interference pattern will not be stable. For a constant phase relationship to exist, the frequencies must be identical.\n*   **Statement 3: The waves are emitted with a constant phase difference.** This is the definition of coherence. A constant phase difference ensures that at any given point, the superposition of the waves results in a predictable and stable interference effect (i.e., the positions of constructive and destructive interference do not change over time).\n\nTherefore, both statements 1 and 3 must be correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: 1, 2 and 3\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes statement 2, which is not a necessary condition for coherence. While statements 1 and 3 are required, two waves do not need to have the same amplitude to be coherent. Coherent waves with different amplitudes will still produce a stable interference pattern. The main effect of having different amplitudes is that the contrast of the interference pattern is reduced; specifically, destructive interference will result in a minimum non-zero intensity, rather than complete cancellation to zero intensity. Coherence is fundamentally about the phase relationship, not the amplitude.\n\n#### B: 1 and 2 only\n\nThis option is incorrect because it omits the essential condition of a constant phase difference (statement 3) and incorrectly includes the non-essential condition of the same amplitude (statement 2). While having the same frequency (statement 1) is a prerequisite for coherence, it is the resulting constant phase difference that defines coherence. Furthermore, as explained for option A, having the same amplitude is not a requirement for two waves to be coherent.\n\n#### D: 2 and 3 only\n\nThis option is incorrect because it omits the fundamental requirement of the same frequency (statement 1). It is impossible for two waves to maintain a constant phase difference (statement 3) if they do not have the same frequency.

So, we can write `I = k(4A\u2080\u00b2)`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n**New situation:**\n*   The amplitude of wave P is doubled, so the new amplitude is `A'_P = 2A\u2080`.\n*   The amplitude of wave Q remains `A'_Q = A\u2080`.\n*   The waves still meet in phase, so the new resultant amplitude, `A_res2`, is `A_res2 = A'_P + A'_Q = 2A\u2080 + A\u2080 = 3A\u2080`.\n*   The new resultant intensity, `I'`, is proportional to the square of the new resultant amplitude: `I' \u221d (A_res2)\u00b2 = (3A\u2080)\u00b2 = 9A\u2080\u00b2`.

The calculated ratio of the new intensity to the old intensity is `9/4`. If this ratio was mistakenly taken as `4/9`, the result would be `(4/9)I \u2248 0.44I`. This is mathematically incorrect.\n\n#### B: 1.5*I*\nThis answer arises from the common misconception that intensity is directly proportional to amplitude (`I \u221d A`), rather than the square of the amplitude (`I \u221d A\u00b2`). The ratio of the new resultant amplitude to the old resultant amplitude is `A_res2 / A_res1 = 3A\u2080 / 2A\u2080 = 1.5`. If one incorrectly assumes `I' / I = A_res2 / A_res1`, the result would be `I' = 1.5I`.

Following the correct method, the new intensity `I'` is `2.25I`. A new intensity of `3.0I` would imply that the square of the new resultant amplitude is 3 times the square of the old resultant amplitude (`I' \u221d A'\u00b2`).

The key to understanding why some waves can be polarised and others cannot lies in the nature of their oscillations relative to their direction of energy propagation.\n\n*   **Transverse Waves:** In a transverse wave, the oscillations (or vibrations) are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. Radio waves, like all electromagnetic waves, are transverse. Their oscillating electric and magnetic fields are at right angles to the direction the wave travels. Because these oscillations occur in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion, they can be oriented in many different directions. A polarising filter works by allowing only the oscillations in one specific plane to pass through, blocking all others. This is why radio waves can be polarised.\n\n*   **Longitudinal Waves:** In a longitudinal wave, the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer. Sound waves are longitudinal; they travel as a series of compressions and rarefactions where the particles of the medium vibrate back and forth along the same line that the wave is travelling. Since the oscillations are already confined to a single direction (the direction of propagation), there are no other planes of oscillation to restrict. Therefore, the concept of polarisation does not apply to longitudinal waves.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental reason radio waves can be polarised while sound waves cannot is that radio waves are transverse and sound waves are longitudinal.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: Radio waves are generally of a higher frequency than sound waves.\nThis statement is factually correct. Radio waves (kHz to GHz range) have much higher frequencies than audible sound waves (20 Hz to 20 kHz). However, the frequency of a wave determines properties like its energy and pitch (for sound), but it does not determine whether the wave can be polarised. Polarisation is a property related to the geometric orientation of the wave's oscillations, not the rate of those oscillations.\n\n#### C: Radio waves can travel through a vacuum, but sound waves cannot travel through a vacuum.\nThis statement is also factually correct. Radio waves are electromagnetic and do not require a medium for propagation, whereas sound waves are mechanical and require a medium (like air, water, or a solid) to travel. This difference explains why we can receive radio signals from space but cannot hear sounds from space. However, this property is not the reason for the difference in polarisability. For example, waves on a rope are transverse and can be polarised, yet they require a medium (the rope) to exist. The ability to be polarised is dependent on being transverse, not on the ability to travel in a vacuum.\n\n#### D: Radio waves travel at a much higher speed than sound waves.\nThis is another factually correct statement. Radio waves travel at the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s in a vacuum), which is nearly a million times faster than the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s). However, the speed of a wave does not influence its ability to be polarised.

It appears to be derived from using an incorrect order for the maximum and an incorrect relationship for the slit separation. For example, if one were to mistakenly use `n=1` (first order) and incorrectly define the slit separation as `d = N/w`, the grating equation `d sin(\u03b8) = n\u03bb` would become `(N/w) sin(\u03b8) = 1\u03bb`, leading to `N = w\u03bb / sin(\u03b8)`. This involves two distinct errors.\n\n**B: `2w\u03bb / sin(\u03b8)`**\nThis expression is incorrect. It arises from using an incorrect relationship for the slit separation `d`. If one correctly identifies the order as `n=2` so that `d sin(\u03b8) = 2\u03bb`, but incorrectly assumes the slit separation is `d = N/w`, then substituting this into the equation would give `(N/w) sin(\u03b8) = 2\u03bb`. Rearranging for `N` would yield `N = 2w\u03bb / sin(\u03b8)`. The correct relationship is `d = w/N`.\n\n**D: `w sin(\u03b8) / \u03bb`**\nThis expression is incorrect because it uses the wrong order for the maximum. Following the correct derivation with `d = w/N`, the equation becomes `(w/N) sin(\u03b8) = n\u03bb`. If one mistakenly uses `n=1` (the first-order maximum) instead of `n=2` as specified in the problem, the equation would be `(w/N) sin(\u03b8) = 1\u03bb`.

Therefore, stating that the sum of e.m.f.s equals the sum of p.d.s in a closed loop is equivalent to stating that the total energy supplied per unit charge is equal to the total energy dissipated per unit charge.

The charge flowing in an electric circuit is conserved.**\nThis statement describes the principle of conservation of charge. This fundamental principle is the basis for Kirchhoff's *first* law (the junction rule), not the second law. The conservation of charge implies that at any junction in a circuit, the total current entering the junction must equal the total current leaving it, as charge cannot be created or destroyed at that point.\n\n**C.

The sum of the potential differences in an electric circuit is equal to the sum of the products of the current and resistance.**\nThis is a mathematical formulation of Kirchhoff's second law (\u03a3V = \u03a3IR) for a circuit containing resistors, applying Ohm's law (V=IR) to calculate the potential differences.

The ammeter is connected between the midpoints of two parallel branches. The problem states that the ammeter reads zero current, which means there is no potential difference across the ammeter. This condition is known as a balanced bridge.\n\nFor a Wheatstone bridge to be balanced, the ratio of the resistances in the two arms must be equal. Let the resistors in the left branch be R\u2081 (10 k\u03a9) and R\u2082 (30 k\u03a9), and the resistors in the right branch be R\u2083 (6.0 k\u03a9) and R_LDR (the resistance of the light-dependent resistor).\n\nThe condition for a balanced bridge is:\nR\u2081 / R\u2082 = R\u2083 / R_LDR\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n10 k\u03a9 / 30 k\u03a9 = 6.0 k\u03a9 / R_LDR\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n1 / 3 = 6.0 k\u03a9 / R_LDR\n\nTo find the resistance of the LDR, rearrange the equation:\nR_LDR = 3 \u00d7 6.0 k\u03a9\nR_LDR = 18 k\u03a9\n\nTherefore, the resistance of the LDR is 18 k\u03a9.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 6.0 k\u03a9\n\nThis answer would be correct only if the ratio of resistances in the left branch (R\u2081/R\u2082) was 1. This would require R\u2081 to be equal to R\u2082. In that specific case, for the bridge to be balanced, the resistance of the LDR would need to be equal to the other resistor in its branch, R\u2083 (6.0 k\u03a9). However, the resistances in the left branch are 10 k\u03a9 and 30 k\u03a9, so their ratio is 10/30 = 1/3, not 1.\n\n#### C: 26 k\u03a9\n\nThis value does not result from the correct application of the balanced Wheatstone bridge principle. A calculation error, such as an incorrect formulation of the resistance ratios or an arithmetic mistake, might lead to such a value. The correct relationship for a balanced bridge is R\u2081/R\u2082 = R\u2083/R_LDR, which, when solved with the given values, yields a resistance of 18 k\u03a9 for the LDR.\n\n#### D: 30 k\u03a9\n\nThis answer would be correct if the resistors in the top part of each branch were equal (i.e., R\u2081 = R\u2083). In that scenario, for the bridge to be balanced, the resistance of the LDR (the bottom-right resistor) would have to be equal to the bottom-left resistor, R\u2082 (30 k\u03a9). However, R\u2081 is 10 k\u03a9 and R\u2083 is 6.0 k\u03a9, so they are not equal.

Since the cell has negligible internal resistance, the potential difference across the parallel combination is equal to the cell's electromotive force (e.m.f.), which is 3.0 V. Therefore, the potential difference across each lamp is 3.0 V.\n    We can rearrange the power formula to solve for the current in one lamp:\n    I = P / V\n    I_lamp = 0.60 W / 3.0 V = 0.20 A\n\n2.  **Total current from the cell:**\n    According to Kirchhoff's First Law, the total current entering a junction is equal to the total current leaving it. In a parallel circuit, the total current from the source is the sum of the currents in each of the parallel branches. Since there are three identical lamps, the total current is three times the current of a single lamp.\n    I_total = 3 \u00d7 I_lamp\n    I_total = 3 \u00d7 0.20 A = 0.60 A\n\n    Alternatively, one could calculate the total power dissipated by the circuit (P_total = 3 \u00d7 0.60 W = 1.80 W) and use the power formula with the total voltage (e.m.f.) to find the total current:\n    I_total = P_total / V_total = 1.80 W / 3.0 V = 0.60 A.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A: 0.067 A**\n    This answer would be obtained if the three lamps were incorrectly assumed to be connected in series. For a single lamp, the resistance is R = V\u00b2/P = (3.0 V)\u00b2 / 0.60 W = 15 \u03a9. If three such lamps were in series, the total resistance would be R_total = 3 \u00d7 15 \u03a9 = 45 \u03a9. The current would then be I = V / R_total = 3.0 V / 45 \u03a9 \u2248 0.067 A. This is incorrect because the problem states the lamps are connected in parallel.\n\n*   **B: 0.20 A**\n    This is the value of the current flowing through a single lamp (I = P/V = 0.60 W / 3.0 V = 0.20 A).

Since R is constant, an increase in the voltmeter reading (V) implies that the current (I) in the circuit must be increasing.\n\nThe terminal potential difference across the cell (V_terminal) is the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell minus the potential difference lost across its internal resistance (r). This is expressed by the equation:\nV_terminal = e.m.f. - Ir\n\nThe e.m.f. and the internal resistance (r) are constant properties of the cell. As the current (I) in the circuit increases, the term 'Ir' (often called the 'lost volts') also increases. Consequently, a larger value is being subtracted from the constant e.m.f., causing the terminal potential difference (V_terminal) to decrease. Therefore, as the voltmeter reading increases, the terminal potential difference across the cell decreases.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. the charge moving through the cell per unit time**\n\nThe quantity \"charge moving through the cell per unit time\" is the definition of electric current (I = \u0394Q/\u0394t). As established in the explanation for the correct answer, for the voltmeter reading (V = IR) to increase, the current (I) must increase. The question asks for a quantity that decreases.\n\n**B. the energy transferred to the fixed resistor per unit charge**\n\nThe quantity \"energy transferred per unit charge\" is the definition of potential difference (V = W/Q). Therefore, this statement refers to the potential difference across the fixed resistor. The problem states that the voltmeter reading increases, and the voltmeter is measuring precisely this quantity. Thus, this quantity increases, it does not decrease.\n\n**C. the intensity of the light incident on the LDR**\n\nFor the current (I) in the circuit to increase, the total resistance of the circuit (R_total = R_LDR + R_fixed + r) must decrease. Since the fixed resistor's resistance and the cell's internal resistance are constant, the resistance of the light-dependent resistor (R_LDR) must decrease. The resistance of an LDR is inversely proportional to the intensity of light incident upon it.

This is the definition of the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell. The problem states that the original cell is replaced with a new cell of the *same electromotive force*. Therefore, the value of *E* remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Effect on V:** The quantity *V* is the potential difference (p.d.) across the external resistor X. This is also known as the terminal potential difference. The relationship between e.m.f. (*E*), terminal p.d. (*V*), current (*I*), and internal resistance (*r*) is given by the equation *V = E - Ir*.\n\n    *   **Initial Condition:** The first cell has negligible internal resistance, so *r* \u2248 0.

A current *I* now flows through this internal resistance, causing a potential drop across it, known as \"lost volts\" (*Ir*). The terminal p.d. is now *V = E - Ir*. Since *I* and *r* are both positive, the term *Ir* is a positive value, meaning *V* is now less than *E*.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the initial potential difference was *V = E* and the final potential difference is *V < E*, the potential difference *V* across the resistor X decreases.\n\nTherefore, *E* shows no change, and *V* decreases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decreases, decreases**\nThis option is incorrect because *E*, the electromotive force, is stated to be the same for the new cell. The e.m.f. is an intrinsic characteristic of the power source and does not change in this scenario. While *V* does decrease, the assertion about *E* is false.\n\n**B: decreases, increases**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, *E* does not decrease. Secondly, *V* does not increase. The introduction of internal resistance increases the total resistance of the circuit. According to Ohm's law for the entire circuit (*I = E / (R + r)*), a higher total resistance leads to a smaller current *I*. Since the potential difference across the external resistor is *V = IR*, a smaller current results in a smaller potential difference *V*.\n\n**D: no change, increases**\nThis option correctly states that *E* shows no change. However, it incorrectly states that *V* increases. The presence of internal resistance means that some of the energy supplied by the cell is dissipated as heat within the cell itself. This results in a \"lost volts\" (*Ir*), so the potential difference available to the external circuit (*V*) is reduced, not increased. The terminal p.d. *V* can only be equal to the e.m.f. *E* when the internal resistance is zero (or when no current is drawn)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_476.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "36 in the circuits shown, the batteries are identical and all have negligible internal resistance. all of\nthe resistors have the same resistance. the diodes have zero resistance when conducting and\ninfinite resistance when not conducting.\n\nin which circuit is the current in the battery greatest?\na b\n= me\ni i\na a\ncc d\nets era\ni i\na _\u2014", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe current drawn from the battery is determined by the battery's voltage (V) and the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit, according to Ohm's Law (I = V/R_eq). Since all batteries have the same voltage, the circuit with the greatest current will be the one with the lowest total equivalent resistance.\n\nIn circuit A, the battery is connected to two parallel branches. For an ideal diode, conventional current flows in the direction of the arrow symbol. In this circuit, the current flows from the positive terminal (top wire) downwards through both branches. Both diodes are oriented to allow this flow, meaning they are **forward-biased**. An ideal forward-biased diode has zero resistance. Therefore, each parallel branch has a total resistance of R. The total equivalent resistance for two identical resistors in parallel is given by:\n1/R_eq = 1/R + 1/R = 2/R\nR_eq = R/2\n\nThis is the lowest equivalent resistance among all four options, resulting in the greatest current from the battery (I = V / (R/2) = 2V/R).\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nIn circuit B, the components are arranged in a single series loop. Conventional current flows from the positive terminal, through the top resistor and the top diode. The top diode is forward-biased and allows current to pass. However, as the current continues around the loop to return to the negative terminal, it encounters the bottom diode. This diode is oriented against the direction of current flow, meaning it is **reverse-biased**. An ideal reverse-biased diode has infinite resistance, which effectively creates an open circuit. Consequently, no current can flow through the circuit. The total resistance is infinite, and the current in the battery is zero. This is the smallest possible current, not the greatest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nIn circuit C, the battery is connected to two parallel branches.\n*   The left branch contains only a resistor of resistance R.\n*   The right branch contains a resistor and a diode. The conventional current attempts to flow downwards, but the diode is oriented upwards, against the direction of flow. This diode is **reverse-biased** and has infinite resistance.\n\nBecause the right branch has infinite resistance, it is an open circuit, and no current flows through it. The entire current from the battery flows only through the left branch. Therefore, the total equivalent resistance of circuit C is simply the resistance of the left branch, which is R. Since R is greater than the equivalent resistance of circuit A (R/2), the current in circuit C (I = V/R) is smaller than the current in circuit A.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nIn circuit D, the battery is connected to two parallel branches.\n*   The left branch contains a resistor and a diode. The conventional current flows downwards, and the diode is oriented in the same direction. Thus, the diode is **forward-biased** and has zero resistance. The total resistance of this branch is R.\n*   The right branch contains a resistor and a diode. The conventional current attempts to flow downwards, but the diode is oriented upwards, against the direction of flow. This diode is **reverse-biased** and has infinite resistance.\n\nSimilar to circuit C, the reverse-biased diode in the right branch creates an open circuit, so no current flows through it. The total current from the battery flows only through the left branch. The total equivalent resistance of circuit D is therefore R.

The atomic number (Z) decreases by 1 because one proton is lost.\n\nApplying this to the decay of \u00b9\u2078\u2089F:\n*   The new mass number A' = 18.\n*   The new atomic number Z' = 9 - 1 = 8.\n\nThe resulting stable isotope has a mass number of 18 and an atomic number of 8. The element with atomic number 8 is oxygen (O), so the product is oxygen-18 (\u00b9\u2078\u2088O).\n\nThe number of neutrons (N) in a nucleus is calculated as the mass number (A) minus the atomic number (Z):\nN = A - Z\nFor the resulting \u00b9\u2078\u2088O isotope:\nNumber of neutrons = 18 - 8 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the nucleus of the stable isotope formed has 10 neutrons.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 7**\nThis value is incorrect. There is no standard nuclear decay process that would lead from fluorine-18 to a daughter nucleus with 7 neutrons. This answer might result from a significant miscalculation of the changes in atomic and mass numbers during \u03b2\u207a decay.\n\n**B: 8**\nThis value represents the atomic number (the number of protons) of the daughter nucleus, \u00b9\u2078\u2088O. The question asks for the number of neutrons, not protons. The number of neutrons is found by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number (18 - 8 = 10).\n\n**C: 9**\nThis is the number of neutrons in the original fluorine-18 nucleus (N = 18 - 9 = 9). The question asks for the number of neutrons in the stable isotope *formed after* the decay.

Let's use a value of 36 km/h, as it converts easily to SI units. To use the kinetic energy formula, the velocity must be in metres per second (m/s).\n    *   Conversion: v = 36 km/h = (36 \u00d7 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 10 m/s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the kinetic energy (KE):** Substitute these estimates into the formula.\n    *   KE = \u00bd \u00d7 1000 kg \u00d7 (10 m/s)\u00b2\n    *   KE = 500 kg \u00d7 100 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n    *   KE = 50,000 J\n    *   In scientific notation, this is 5 \u00d7 10\u2074 J.\n\nThis calculated value matches the option, confirming it is a reasonable estimate for the kinetic energy of a small car in a town.\n\n---\n### Explanation for why B is incorrect\n\nThis value for kinetic energy is too large. To demonstrate this, we can use the kinetic energy formula (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2) to calculate the velocity a car would need to have this much energy. Assuming a mass (m) of 1000 kg for a small car:\n\n*   KE = 5 \u00d7 10\u2077 J\n*   5 \u00d7 10\u2077 J = \u00bd \u00d7 1000 kg \u00d7 v\u00b2\n*   v\u00b2 = (2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10\u2077 J) / 1000 kg = 1 \u00d7 10\u2078 / 10\u00b3 = 10\u2075 m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n*   v = \u221a(100,000) m/s \u2248 316 m/s\n\nA velocity of 316 m/s is equivalent to over 1100 km/h, which is nearly the speed of sound. This is an impossible speed for a car, especially one travelling within a town. Therefore, this estimate is unreasonable.\n\n---\n### Explanation for why C is incorrect\n\nThis value for kinetic energy is physically impossible for a car. We can calculate the required velocity for a 1000 kg car to have a kinetic energy of 5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2070 J using the rearranged formula v = \u221a(2KE / m):\n\n*   v = \u221a( (2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2070 J) / 1000 kg )\n*   v = \u221a( 1 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 / 10\u00b3 ) m/s\n*   v = \u221a(10\u2078) m/s = 10,000 m/s or 10 km/s\n\nA velocity of 10 km/s is in the range of orbital speeds for satellites in low Earth orbit. It is far beyond the capability of any terrestrial vehicle.

An energy of 5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b3 Joules is an immense quantity, comparable to the energy released by the first atomic bombs (the Trinity test released approximately 8.8 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b3 J).

This means the initial gradient of the velocity-time graph must be zero, so the curve must start horizontally.\n    *   As time progresses, the acceleration increases to a maximum value. This means the gradient of the velocity-time graph must increase, causing the curve to become progressively steeper.\n    *   After reaching its peak, the acceleration decreases back to zero. This means the gradient of the velocity-time graph must decrease, causing the curve to become progressively less steep (flattening out).\n3.  **Velocity Change:** The acceleration is always non-negative (a \u2265 0). This indicates that the velocity is always increasing or, at the points where a=0, momentarily constant. The velocity never decreases.\n\nGraph A correctly depicts all these characteristics.

A non-negative acceleration means that the object's velocity is always increasing or staying constant; it can never decrease.\n\nGraph C shows the velocity increasing to a maximum, then decreasing, passing through zero, and becoming negative. A decreasing velocity implies a negative acceleration. Since the provided acceleration is never negative, graph C cannot be correct.

The gradient of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration.

The acceleration of the ball is due to gravity. Since air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the ball throughout its motion is its weight, which acts vertically downwards. According to Newton's second law (F=ma), the acceleration of the ball must also be constant and directed vertically downwards.\n\nThe \"path of the ball\" refers to its trajectory, and the direction of motion at any instant is given by the velocity vector, which is tangent to this path. The ball is thrown horizontally, so at the moment it is thrown (t=0), its velocity is purely horizontal. At this specific instant, the vertical acceleration vector is indeed at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the horizontal velocity vector.\n\nHowever, as the ball falls, it gains a vertical component of velocity. The resultant velocity vector is the vector sum of the constant horizontal velocity and the increasing vertical velocity. This resultant vector points downwards and forwards. The angle between the velocity vector (tangent to the path) and the constant downward acceleration vector becomes progressively smaller than 90\u00b0 as the ball descends. Since the acceleration is not *always* at right angles to the path, this statement is incorrect.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Option B\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The path of a projectile under the influence of a constant gravitational force (with negligible air resistance) is a parabola, not a circle.\n\nWe can demonstrate this by analyzing the horizontal and vertical components of motion:\n*   **Horizontal motion:** There are no horizontal forces, so the horizontal acceleration is zero. The horizontal velocity (v\u2093) is constant. The horizontal distance covered is x = v\u2093t.\n*   **Vertical motion:** The ball is under constant downward acceleration due to gravity (g). The initial vertical velocity is zero. The vertical distance fallen is y = \u00bdgt\u00b2.\n\nBy eliminating the time variable (t) from these two equations (t = x/v\u2093), we get the equation for the trajectory: y = (g / 2v\u2093\u00b2)x\u00b2. This is the mathematical equation for a parabola. A circular path would require a force that always points towards a fixed center, which is not the case in projectile motion.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Option C\n\nThis statement is correct. The problem states that air resistance is negligible. Therefore, the only force acting on the ball after it has been thrown is the gravitational force (its weight). The weight of the ball (W = mg) is constant in magnitude and acts in a constant direction (vertically downwards), assuming the motion occurs near the Earth's surface where the gravitational field strength (g) is uniform.\n\nAccording to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the net force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F_net = ma). Since the net force on the ball is constant (F_net = W) and its mass (m) is constant, its acceleration (a = F_net / m) must also be constant. The acceleration of the ball is equal to the acceleration of free fall, g, and it is directed vertically downwards throughout the entire flight.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Option D\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The time the ball spends in the air (the time of flight) is determined entirely by its vertical motion, which is independent of its horizontal motion.\n\nThe time of flight depends on the initial height of the building and the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is thrown horizontally, so its initial vertical velocity is zero. Let the height of the building be 'h'. We can use the equation of motion for vertical displacement:\ns = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2\n\nHere, s = h (vertical displacement), u = 0 (initial vertical velocity), and a = g (acceleration due to gravity).\nSo, h = (0)t + \u00bdgt\u00b2\nh = \u00bdgt\u00b2\n\nSolving for the time, t:\nt = \u221a(2h/g)\n\nThis equation shows that the time in the air depends only on the height 'h' and the acceleration of free fall 'g'. It is completely independent of the horizontal velocity at which the ball is thrown.

Conservation of Momentum:** The problem states that the two objects form an isolated system. A fundamental principle of physics is the **law of conservation of linear momentum**, which states that for an isolated system, the total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. In option C, the total momentum before the collision is 6 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 and the total momentum after the collision is also 6 kg m s\u207b\u00b9, satisfying this law.\n\n**2.

By definition, an inelastic collision is one in which the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. Specifically, some of the initial kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, and the work done to deform the objects. Therefore, the total kinetic energy after an inelastic collision must be less than the total kinetic energy before the collision. In option C, the total kinetic energy before the collision is 90 J, and the total kinetic energy after is 30 J. Since 30 J < 90 J, kinetic energy is lost, which is consistent with an inelastic collision.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only one that correctly represents both the conservation of momentum and the loss of kinetic energy characteristic of an inelastic collision in an isolated system.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it violates the law of conservation of linear momentum.

Here, the momentum changes from 6 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 to 2 kg m s\u207b\u00b9, which is physically impossible without an external force acting on the system.\n\n**B:** This option correctly shows the conservation of momentum (6 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 before and after). However, it shows the total kinetic energy increasing from 30 J to 90 J. An increase in kinetic energy during a collision of this type would violate the law of conservation of energy. Kinetic energy is lost, not gained, in an inelastic collision.\n\n**D:** This option correctly shows the conservation of momentum (6 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 before and after). However, it shows that the total kinetic energy is also conserved (90 J before and 90 J after). A collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved is known as an **elastic collision**.

X = time, Y = height above surface**\n\nAn object falling at terminal velocity moves at a constant speed. Let this constant terminal velocity be *v<sub>T</sub>*. The distance the object falls is directly proportional to the time elapsed (*distance = v<sub>T</sub> \u00d7 time*).\n\nLet the height of the object above the surface at any time *t* be *h*, and its initial height at *t* = 0 be *h<sub>0</sub>*. As the object falls, its height decreases. The height *h* at time *t* can be expressed as:\n*h* = *h<sub>0</sub>* \u2013 (distance fallen)\n*h* = *h<sub>0</sub>* \u2013 *v<sub>T</sub>*t\n\nThis equation is in the form of a linear equation *y = c + mx*, where:\n*   *y* corresponds to the height *h* (quantity Y).\n*   *x* corresponds to the time *t* (quantity X).\n*   *c* is the y-intercept, corresponding to the initial height *h<sub>0</sub>* (a positive value).\n*   *m* is the gradient, corresponding to \u2013*v<sub>T</sub>* (a negative constant).\n\nThe graph of height versus time is therefore a straight line with a positive y-intercept and a constant negative gradient, which perfectly matches the graph shown.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. X = time, Y = acceleration**\n\nWhen an object reaches terminal velocity, the upward force of air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the downward force of gravity (its weight). According to Newton's first law, the net force on the object is zero. Consequently, its acceleration is also zero (*F<sub>net</sub> = ma = 0*). As the object falls at a constant terminal velocity, its acceleration remains zero. A graph of acceleration (Y) against time (X) would be a horizontal line at Y = 0, which is different from the sloping line shown.\n\n**C. X = distance moved, Y = kinetic energy**\n\nKinetic energy is given by the formula *KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2*, where *m* is the mass and *v* is the velocity of the object. Since the object is falling at its terminal velocity, its velocity *v* is constant. As the mass *m* of the object is also constant, its kinetic energy (*KE*) must be constant throughout its fall. A graph of kinetic energy (Y) against distance moved (X) would be a horizontal line at a constant positive value, not a downward-sloping line.\n\n**D. X = distance moved, Y = velocity**\n\nThe term \"terminal velocity\" signifies the constant velocity that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (like air) through which it is falling prevents further acceleration. By definition, this velocity is constant. Therefore, as the object falls and the distance moved increases, its velocity remains unchanged. A graph of velocity (Y) against distance moved (X) would be a horizontal line at a constant positive value equal to the terminal velocity.

This error arises from correctly calculating the final velocity (0.500 m s\u207b\u00b9) and the final kinetic energy (KE_final = \u00bd(10000 kg)(0.500 m s\u207b\u00b9)\u00b2 = 1250 J) but failing to subtract this from the initial kinetic energy to find the loss.\n\n#### B: 7500 J\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly treating kinetic energy as a vector quantity. It arises from calculating the initial kinetic energy of each carriage separately (KE\u2081 = 10000 J and KE\u2082 = 2500 J) and then subtracting them (10000 J - 2500 J = 7500 J) instead of adding them. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity, so the total energy of a system is the sum of the energies of its components, regardless of their direction of motion.\n\n#### D: 12500 J\nThis value is the total initial kinetic energy of the system before the collision. This answer would be chosen if one mistakenly assumed that all the initial kinetic energy is lost. However, since the combined carriages are still moving after the collision (with a final velocity of 0.500 m s\u207b\u00b9), they possess final kinetic energy. In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved; some of it is converted into other forms like heat and sound.

The resultant force acting on the object is zero.**\n\nThis is the correct and most fundamental condition for an object to be in translational equilibrium. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force. This state of constant velocity (which includes zero velocity, i.e., being at rest) is called equilibrium.\n\nNewton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma) mathematically supports this. For an object to be in equilibrium, its acceleration (a) must be zero. If a = 0, then the resultant force (F) must also be zero, regardless of the object's mass. This single condition covers both static equilibrium (where the object is stationary) and dynamic equilibrium (where the object moves at a constant velocity).\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. The object has a constant non-zero acceleration.**\n\nThis statement describes a state of non-equilibrium. If an object has a non-zero acceleration, its velocity is changing. By definition, equilibrium requires a constant velocity, which means the acceleration must be zero. A constant non-zero acceleration implies, according to Newton's Second Law (F = ma), that there is a constant, non-zero resultant force acting on the object, which is the opposite of the condition for equilibrium.\n\n**B. The object is stationary.**\n\nWhile a stationary object is indeed in equilibrium (a state known as static equilibrium), this is not the only way for an object to be in equilibrium. An object moving at a constant velocity is also in equilibrium (a state known as dynamic equilibrium). Since an object can be in equilibrium while moving, being stationary is a sufficient but not a necessary condition. The question asks for a condition that **must** apply to all cases of equilibrium, making this option incomplete.\n\n**C. There are no forces acting on the object.**\n\nThis is a specific case of equilibrium, but not a mandatory condition. An object can be in equilibrium even when multiple forces are acting on it, provided that these forces are balanced. For example, a book resting on a table is in equilibrium under the action of two forces: its weight acting downwards and the normal contact force from the table acting upwards. These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so their vector sum (the resultant force) is zero. Therefore, the absence of all forces is not required; it is the absence of a *resultant* force that is essential."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_492.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "12 akite is in equilibrium at the end of a string, as shown.\nkite\nstring\nww\n\nthe kite has three forces acting on it: the weight w, the tension 7 in the string, and the force f\nfrom the wind.\nwhich vector diagram represents the forces acting on the kite?\n\na b cc d\n\nt t + w f ww\n\nf f\nme il f t", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nFor an object to be in equilibrium, the net force acting on it must be zero.

From the diagram, the string is angled downwards and to the left, so the tension force acts in this direction.\n3.  **Force from the wind (F):** This force (a combination of lift and drag) must balance the other two forces. To counteract the downward components of both weight and tension, the wind force must have an upward component. To counteract the leftward component of the tension, the wind force must have a rightward component. Therefore, the force F must be directed generally upwards and to the right.\n\nVector diagram A correctly represents these three forces.

The tension (T) is shown acting upwards and to the left. However, tension in a string is a pulling force, so it must act along the string *away* from the kite, which is downwards and to the left. Additionally, the wind force (F) is shown with a downward component, which is incorrect as the wind must provide an upward force (lift) to keep the kite in the air.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis diagram is incorrect for the same reasons as option B. The vectors form a closed loop, but the directions assigned to the tension (T) and the wind force (F) do not correspond to the physical reality of the situation. Tension (T) must act downwards and to the left, along the string. The wind force (F) must have an upward component to counteract gravity.

However, the direction of the wind force (F) is incorrect. It is shown acting upwards and to the left. For the kite to be in equilibrium, the horizontal components of the forces must cancel out. Since the tension (T) has a component to the left, the wind force (F) must have a component to the right to achieve a net horizontal force of zero.

The moment is `5.0 N \u00d7 (PY \u00d7 sin(60\u00b0))`.

This is incorrect because both 6.0 N forces contribute to the clockwise moment.\n\n*   **B) 12 m:** This result is obtained if the `sin(60\u00b0)` term is omitted from the calculation (`XY = 60 / 5.0 = 12 m`). This error stems from incorrectly using the distance along the slanted line (XY) instead of the perpendicular distance to the line of action of the forces. The moment calculation requires the perpendicular component of the distance or the component of the force perpendicular to the lever arm, both of which involve the `sin(60\u00b0)` term.\n\n*   **D) 24 m:** This result is obtained by incorrectly using `cos(60\u00b0)` instead of `sin(60\u00b0)` in the calculation for the anticlockwise moment (`XY = 12 / cos(60\u00b0) = 12 / 0.5 = 24 m`).

The smallest area of contact is produced when the block rests on the face formed by its two shortest sides.\n\n1.  **Identify the side lengths and convert to SI units:**\n    *   l\u2081 = 12.0 cm = 0.120 m\n    *   l\u2082 = 15.0 cm = 0.150 m\n    *   l\u2083 = 10.0 cm = 0.100 m\n\n2.  **Calculate the smallest possible area (A_min):**\n    *   The smallest area is formed by the two shortest sides: l\u2081 and l\u2083.\n    *   A_min = 0.120 m \u00d7 0.100 m = 0.0120 m\u00b2\n\n3.  **Calculate the mass (m) of the block:**\n    *   First, calculate the volume (V): V = l\u2081 \u00d7 l\u2082 \u00d7 l\u2083 = 0.120 m \u00d7 0.150 m \u00d7 0.100 m = 0.00180 m\u00b3\n    *   Use the density formula (\u03c1 = m/V) to find the mass: m = \u03c1 \u00d7 V\n    *   m = (1.13 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m\u207b\u00b3) \u00d7 (0.00180 m\u00b3) = 20.34 kg\n\n4.  **Calculate the force (F), which is the weight of the block:**\n    *   F = m \u00d7 g (using g \u2248 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2)\n    *   F = 20.34 kg \u00d7 9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2 \u2248 199.54 N\n\n5.  **Calculate the maximum pressure (P_max):**\n    *   P_max = F / A_min\n    *   P_max = 199.54 N / 0.0120 m\u00b2 \u2248 16628 Pa\n    *   Convert to kilopascals (1 kPa = 1000 Pa): P_max \u2248 16.6 kPa\n\nAlternatively, for a solid block of uniform density, pressure can be calculated as P = \u03c1gh, where h is the height of the block.

It appears to be derived from the numerical value of the density (1.13 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m\u207b\u00b3) but with an incorrect power of ten and unit. A correct calculation involves finding the block's weight and dividing by the minimum possible contact area, which results in a much larger value. This answer likely stems from a conceptual misunderstanding or a significant error in calculation.\n\n**B: 1.70 kPa**\nThis value is incorrect and likely arises from an error in calculating the force. If the force were mistakenly taken as the mass of the block (F \u2248 20.34 N, omitting the multiplication by g), the pressure would be calculated as P = 20.34 N / 0.0120 m\u00b2 \u2248 1695 Pa, which is approximately 1.70 kPa. The force exerted by the block is its weight (mg), not just its mass.\n\n**C: 11.1 kPa**\nThis value represents the *minimum* pressure the block can exert, not the maximum. Minimum pressure occurs when the contact area is maximised. This happens when the block rests on its largest face (12.0 cm \u00d7 15.0 cm). In this orientation, the height is the shortest side (10.0 cm or 0.100 m).\nUsing the formula P = \u03c1gh:\nP_min = (1.13 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m\u207b\u00b3) \u00d7 (9.81 m s\u207b\u00b2) \u00d7 (0.100 m) \u2248 11085 Pa \u2248 11.1 kPa.\nThe question asks for the maximum pressure."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_495.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 what is the definition of power?\na_ work done in one second\nb_~ work done in unit time\nc_ work done per second\nd_ work done per unit time", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. work done per unit time\n\nPower is fundamentally defined as the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred. A rate measures how a quantity changes with respect to another quantity, typically time. The mathematical expression for power (P) is P = W / t, where W is the work done and t is the time interval over which the work is performed.\n\nThe phrase \"work done per unit time\" accurately describes this relationship. The word \"per\" signifies division, indicating that work done is divided by the time taken. This definition is general and applies to any system of units, as \"unit time\" can refer to a second, a minute, an hour, or any other standard interval of time. Therefore, this is the most precise and universally applicable definition of power.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A. work done in one second\n\nThis statement describes a specific case rather than the general definition of power. While it is true that a power of one watt corresponds to one joule of work being done every second, the definition of power itself must apply to any duration of time, not just one second. Defining power this way would be too restrictive and would not accurately describe situations where the time interval is different from one second.\n\n#### B. work done in unit time\n\nThis option is less precise than \"work done per unit time\". The phrase \"work done in unit time\" can be interpreted as the total amount of work completed *during* a single, specific time interval (e.g., the work done in the first second). Power, however, is a rate calculated over an entire duration. For instance, if 10 joules of work are done steadily over 2 seconds, the power is 5 watts. The \"work done in unit time\" (i.e., in one second) is 5 joules, but the definition of power is the *rate*, best expressed with the word \"per\".\n\n#### C. work done per second\n\nThis statement is dimensionally correct and describes the SI unit of power, the watt (W), which is equivalent to one joule per second (J/s). However, a fundamental physical definition should be independent of the specific units being used. The term \"second\" is a specific SI unit of time. The correct definition should use the more general term \"unit time\" to be universally applicable across all systems of measurement.

Not all of this energy is converted into mechanical work to move the car. The driving force must be calculated from the useful output power, which accounts for the 60% efficiency.\n\n**D: 110 N**\nThis answer is incorrect and results from a misunderstanding of the efficiency formula. It is obtained by incorrectly dividing the input power by the efficiency to find the output power.\n*   Incorrect calculation of output power: P_out = P_in / \u03b7 = 800 W / 0.60 \u2248 1333 W.\n*   This would lead to a force of: F = 1333 W / 12 m s\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 110 N.\nThis calculation is fundamentally flawed because an engine's output power cannot be greater than its input power, as this would violate the principle of conservation of energy.

The calculation performed is likely mass \u00d7 height (50 kg \u00d7 1.6 m = 80). Work is a measure of energy transfer, and gravitational potential energy is defined as mgh.

The key physical principles involved are Young's modulus, strain, extension, and Hooke's law.\n\n*   **Young's Modulus (E)** is a measure of a material's stiffness and is defined as the ratio of stress (\u03c3) to strain (\u03b5) in the region of elastic deformation. On a stress-strain graph, the Young modulus is represented by the gradient of the linear portion of the curve: E = \u03c3 / \u03b5.\n*   **Strain (\u03b5)** is the fractional change in length, defined as extension (e) divided by the original length (L): \u03b5 = e / L. Since all wires have the same original linear dimensions (same L), their extension is directly proportional to their strain (e \u221d \u03b5).\n*   **Hooke's Law** states that stress is directly proportional to strain (\u03c3 \u221d \u03b5) up to the limit of proportionality.

Let's consider a point on line Q, for instance, at a strain of \u03b5. The corresponding stress is \u03c3_Q. For the same strain \u03b5, the stress on line P, \u03c3_P, is visually about twice the value of \u03c3_Q.\n    So, E_P = \u03c3_P / \u03b5 and E_Q = \u03c3_Q / \u03b5.\n    The ratio E_P / E_Q = (\u03c3_P / \u03b5) / (\u03c3_Q / \u03b5) = \u03c3_P / \u03c3_Q.\n    Since \u03c3_P \u2248 2 * \u03c3_Q, the ratio E_P / E_Q \u2248 2.

The correct conversion is 1 m\u00b2 = 10\u2076 mm\u00b2, so 250 mm\u00b2 = 250 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2. This answer would be obtained if the conversion factor for length (1 m = 1000 mm) was used incorrectly for area, for example by using 250 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b2, which leads to a result that is 10\u00b3 times smaller than the correct value.\n\n**C. 8.0 \u00d7 10\u2078 N m\u207b\u00b2**\nThis answer is incorrect as it results from two separate errors. Firstly, it uses the total weight of the object (10 kN) as the force (F) on a single rod, instead of dividing the total weight by the four supporting rods. Secondly, it contains the same unit conversion error for the cross-sectional area as described for option A (using 10\u207b\u00b3 instead of 10\u207b\u2076 as the conversion factor for mm\u00b2 to m\u00b2).\n\n**D. 8.0 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 N m\u207b\u00b2**\nThis value is incorrect because it results from using the total weight of the object (10 kN) as the compressive force (F) in the calculation, rather than the force supported by a single rod. The total weight is distributed equally among the four rods, so the force on one rod is 10 kN / 4 = 2.5 kN. Using the total force of 10 kN leads to a calculated Young modulus that is four times larger than the correct value."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_502.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "22 the graph shows how the length of a spring varies with the force applied to it. two areas p and q\nare labelled.\nlength\np\nq |\n0 '\n0 force\nwhich area represents the work done in stretching the spring?\na areap\nb areaq\nc areap+areaq\nd area q-areap", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nThe work done in stretching a spring is equal to the elastic potential energy stored within it.

The width of this rectangle is the applied force (F), and its height is the original, unstretched length of the spring (L\u2080). Therefore, Area Q = F \u00d7 L\u2080. This quantity represents the product of the final force and the original length, which has no direct physical significance in this context and is not the formula for work done in stretching the spring.

Malus's Law for amplitude requires multiplying the incident amplitude by the cosine of the angle between the incident polarisation and the filter's transmission axis (A * cos(50\u00b0)). This calculation yields approximately 0.64A. The value 0.17A would result from a significant calculation error or the use of an incorrect physical principle.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis value, 0.41A, is obtained by incorrectly applying the formula for intensity to find the amplitude. Malus's Law for intensity states that I_t = I_i * cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where I is intensity. If one mistakenly uses this relationship for amplitude, they would calculate:\n\nA_t = A_i * cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = A * cos\u00b2(50\u00b0)\nA_t = A * (0.6428)\u00b2 \u2248 A * 0.413\n\nThe question asks for the transmitted amplitude, not intensity. Intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude (I \u221d A\u00b2). Therefore, the amplitude itself is proportional to cos(\u03b8), not cos\u00b2(\u03b8).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis value, 0.80A, likely arises from using the incorrect angle in the Malus's Law calculation. The correct angle, \u03b8, is the angle between the incident light's polarisation axis (vertical) and the filter's transmission axis, which is given as 50\u00b0.\n\nAn error could be made by using the complementary angle (90\u00b0 - 50\u00b0 = 40\u00b0). This might happen if one mistakenly takes the angle relative to the horizontal. Using this incorrect angle would give:\n\nA_t = A * cos(40\u00b0) \u2248 A * 0.766\n\nThis value (0.77A) is close to 0.80A and represents a common misunderstanding of how to define the angle \u03b8 in Malus's Law.

The regions where the particles are crowded together are called compressions, and the regions where they are spread apart are called rarefactions. The diagram shows a central compression located between two rarefactions.\n\n2.  **Relate Particle Position to Displacement:** In a longitudinal wave, particle displacement refers to the distance a particle has moved from its undisturbed equilibrium position.\n    *   At the center of a **rarefaction**, particles on either side have moved away from this point. The particle at the exact center, however, has zero displacement.\n    *   At the center of a **compression**, particles on either side have moved towards this point. The particle at the exact center also has zero displacement.\n\n3.  **Interpret Points P and Q:** The question asks for a graph of displacement versus distance, spanning from point P to point Q. Given the options, where the displacement at the start (P) and end (Q) of the distance `x` is shown as zero, we must interpret P and Q as points of zero displacement. This means P and Q are the centers of two consecutive regions of either compression or rarefaction.\n    *   The diagram shows a compression between two rarefactions. Therefore, it is logical to interpret P as the center of the first rarefaction and Q as the center of the second rarefaction.\n    *   The distance between the centers of two consecutive rarefactions is, by definition, one full wavelength (\u03bb). Thus, the distance `x` in the diagram represents one wavelength.\n\n4.  **Trace Displacement over One Wavelength:**\n    *   At point **P** (center of the first rarefaction), the displacement is **zero**.\n    *   As we move from P towards the central compression, particles are displaced towards the center of the compression.

This means they are displaced to the left, which is a **negative displacement**. The magnitude of the displacement increases to a maximum (most negative) halfway between the compression and the next rarefaction (Q).\n    *   At point **Q** (center of the second rarefaction), the displacement returns to **zero**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The graph of displacement versus distance from P to Q should show one complete cycle, starting at zero, becoming positive, returning to zero, becoming negative, and finally returning to zero. This pattern corresponds exactly to graph C.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Incorrect Options:**\n\n*   **A:** This graph shows displacement being zero at the start and end of the distance `x`, but it is only positive in between. This would represent the displacement over half a wavelength, for instance, from the center of a rarefaction (P) to the center of a compression (Q). This does not match the full R-C-R structure shown between P and Q in the diagram.\n\n*   **B:** This graph also shows displacement over half a wavelength, but with only negative values. This would represent the displacement from the center of a compression (P) to the center of a rarefaction (Q). This contradicts the structure shown in the diagram.\n\n*   **D:** This graph shows a full wavelength, but it starts with a negative displacement before becoming positive. This would be correct if P were the center of a compression and Q were the center of the next compression.

The order of increasing frequency is: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.\n    The typical frequency range for ultraviolet (UV) radiation is approximately 8 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz to 3 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 Hz. The given frequency of 3.0 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 Hz falls at the very high-frequency end of the ultraviolet region, just before the X-ray region begins. Therefore, its principal region is ultraviolet.\n\n2.  **Identifying a Wave with a Lower Frequency:**\n    To find a wave with a lower frequency, we must look at regions of the EM spectrum that come before ultraviolet. These include visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves.\n    Visible light has a frequency range of approximately 4.3 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz to 7.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2074 Hz.

Firstly, as explained for option A, the principal region is not infrared.

However, it incorrectly identifies X-rays as having a lower frequency. In the electromagnetic spectrum, X-rays have a higher frequency than ultraviolet waves. The frequency of X-rays begins at approximately 3.0 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2076 Hz and increases, so they have frequencies equal to or greater than the given wave, not lower."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_506.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 a source of sound emits waves of a constant frequency. the source moves at a constant speed\nin a straight line relative to a stationary observer.\nwhich velocity of the source gives the smallest observed frequency?\n[| seeedims\u00ae | recion\na 5 away from observer\nb 10 away from observer\ncc 15 towards observer\nd 20 towards observer", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: B\n\nThe phenomenon described is the Doppler effect for sound waves. According to the Doppler effect, the frequency of a wave perceived by an observer changes if there is relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.\n\nTo achieve the *smallest* observed frequency, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Direction of Motion:** The source must be moving *away* from the stationary observer. When the source recedes, the wavefronts it emits are spaced further apart from the observer's perspective. This results in an increase in the observed wavelength and a corresponding decrease in the observed frequency (a lower pitch).\n2.  **Magnitude of Speed:** The magnitude of this frequency decrease is proportional to the speed of the source. The faster the source moves away, the more the wavefronts are stretched, and the lower the observed frequency becomes.\n\nThe formula for the observed frequency (f') when a source moves away from a stationary observer is:\nf' = f * (v / (v + v_s))\nwhere *f* is the source frequency, *v* is the speed of sound, and *v_s* is the speed of the source.\n\nTo minimize f', the value of the fraction (v / (v + v_s)) must be minimized. This occurs when the denominator (v + v_s) is maximized. Since *v* is constant, this requires maximizing the source's speed, *v_s*, in the direction away from the observer.\n\nComparing the options where the source moves away (A and B), the speed in option B (10 m/s) is greater than the speed in option A (5 m/s). Therefore, a velocity of 10 m/s away from the observer will produce the largest decrease in frequency among these two options, and the smallest frequency overall, since options C and D involve motion towards the observer.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. 5 m/s away from observer**\nWhile a source moving away from the observer does result in a lower observed frequency, the magnitude of the frequency drop depends on the speed. A speed of 5 m/s away from the observer will cause less of a frequency decrease than a speed of 10 m/s away. Therefore, this option results in a higher observed frequency than option B, and is not the smallest possible value among the choices.\n\n**C. 15 m/s towards observer**\nWhen a sound source moves *towards* a stationary observer, the wavefronts are compressed. This leads to a decrease in the observed wavelength and an *increase* in the observed frequency. This is the opposite of what is required to find the smallest observed frequency.\n\n**D. 20 m/s towards observer**\nSimilar to option C, a source moving towards an observer causes an *increase* in the observed frequency. Furthermore, because the speed (20 m/s) is the highest of all the options, this scenario would actually produce the *largest* observed frequency, not the smallest."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_507.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 what could describe the time-base of a cathode-ray oscilloscope (cro)?\na the frequency per division on the screen\nb_ the number of divisions on the screen per unit frequency\nc the number of divisions on the screen per unit time\nd the time per division on the screen", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**D. the time per division on the screen**\n\nA cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO) displays a graph of voltage (on the vertical y-axis) against time (on the horizontal x-axis). The time-base is the circuitry that controls the horizontal movement of the electron beam across the screen. It sweeps the beam at a constant, calibrated speed. The time-base setting on the CRO determines this speed and is expressed in units of time per division (e.g., s/div, ms/div, or \u03bcs/div). This value directly defines the scale of the horizontal time axis, allowing for the measurement of time intervals, such as the period of a wave, by counting the number of horizontal divisions it occupies on the screen.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. the frequency per division on the screen**\n\nThis is incorrect. The horizontal axis of a CRO is a time axis, not a frequency axis. The time-base control is calibrated to measure time intervals directly. While the frequency of a periodic signal can be calculated from its period (T), which is measured using the time-base (f = 1/T), the time-base setting itself is not in units of frequency per division (Hz/div).\n\n**B. the number of divisions on the screen per unit frequency**\n\nThis is dimensionally and conceptually incorrect. The units would be divisions per hertz (div/Hz), which is equivalent to divisions-seconds (div\u00b7s).

The time-base provides a scale factor to convert a distance on the screen (in divisions) into a time interval.\n\n**C. the number of divisions on the screen per unit time**\n\nThis describes the sweep speed of the electron beam (e.g., in divisions per second). While the time-base setting determines this speed (sweep speed = 1 / time-base setting), it is not the quantity that defines the time-base control itself. The control is calibrated as \"time per division\" because this is the value a user directly applies to measure the period or other time intervals from the screen.

Displacement refers to the instantaneous position of a particle of the medium from its equilibrium position. This principle holds true for all types of waves and for all phase relationships between them, whether it results in constructive interference (displacements in the same direction add up) or destructive interference (displacements in opposite directions cancel out).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. Their amplitudes are added together.**\nThis statement is only true under the specific condition of perfect constructive interference, where the waves are perfectly in phase. Amplitude is the *maximum* displacement, not the instantaneous displacement. In the case of destructive interference, where waves are out of phase, the resultant amplitude is the *difference* between the individual amplitudes. For example, if two waves of equal amplitude are perfectly out of phase (180\u00b0), their displacements cancel each other out, and the resultant amplitude is zero. The general principle that applies to all cases of superposition is the addition of instantaneous displacements, not amplitudes.\n\n**C. Their frequencies are added together.**\nThe frequency of a wave is determined by its source and does not change when it superposes with another wave. When waves interfere, they pass through each other, and the original frequencies of the constituent waves are conserved. If two waves of different frequencies superpose, they create a complex waveform known as 'beats', where the amplitude of the resultant wave varies at a frequency equal to the difference between the two original frequencies. The frequencies themselves are not added. For a stable interference pattern to be observed, the waves must be coherent, which implies they must have the same frequency.\n\n**D. Their velocities are added together.**\nThe velocity of a wave is a property of the medium through which it propagates. When two waves travel through the same medium, they do so at the same speed (assuming they are of the same type). During superposition, the waves pass through each other, and their velocities are unaffected by the interaction. After passing the point of superposition, each wave continues to travel with its original velocity.

A larger wavelength increases the ratio \u03bb/a, which leads to a *greater* amount of diffraction, not less.\n\n**C: Decrease the width of the slit.**\nThe amount of diffraction is proportional to the ratio \u03bb/a. Decreasing the width of the slit (a) would make the denominator of this ratio smaller, thereby *increasing* the overall value of the ratio. A larger \u03bb/a ratio corresponds to a *greater* amount of diffraction.\n\n**D: Increase the wavelength of the wave.**\nThe amount of diffraction is directly proportional to the wavelength (\u03bb). Increasing the wavelength increases the ratio \u03bb/a, which results in a *greater* amount of diffraction.

The dust, being light, is agitated by the moving air and settles at the points of minimum disturbance, which are the nodes. Therefore, the heaps of dust mark the positions of the nodes of the stationary wave.\n\nThe distance between any two consecutive nodes is equal to half a wavelength (\u03bb/2). The problem states that the distance between four heaps of dust (four nodes) is 30 cm. This distance encompasses three full intervals between consecutive nodes.\n\nTherefore, the distance spanning three half-wavelengths is 30 cm:\n3 \u00d7 (\u03bb/2) = 30 cm\n\nFrom this, we can find the length of half a wavelength:\n\u03bb/2 = 30 cm / 3 = 10 cm\n\nThe full wavelength (\u03bb) is twice this value:\n\u03bb = 2 \u00d7 10 cm = 20 cm\n\nTo use the wave speed equation, the wavelength must be in SI units (meters):\n\u03bb = 20 cm = 0.20 m\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the equation v = f\u03bb. We can rearrange this to solve for the frequency:\nf = v / \u03bb\n\nSubstituting the given speed of sound (v = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9) and the calculated wavelength:\nf = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.20 m = 1650 Hz\n\nThus, the frequency of the sound is 1650 Hz.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis answer is incorrect because it likely arises from a misinterpretation of the relationship between the number of nodes and the number of half-wavelengths. This value would be obtained if one incorrectly assumed that the distance between four heaps of dust corresponds to four half-wavelength intervals (4 \u00d7 \u03bb/2).\n\nFollowing this incorrect assumption:\n4 \u00d7 (\u03bb/2) = 30 cm\n2\u03bb = 30 cm\n\u03bb = 15 cm = 0.15 m\n\nUsing this incorrect wavelength in the wave speed equation:\nf = v / \u03bb = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.15 m = 2200 Hz\n\nThe error lies in the initial premise. The distance between *n* points is spanned by *(n-1)* intervals. Consequently, the distance between four nodes is spanned by three intervals, not four.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis answer is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the definition of wavelength in a stationary wave. While the first step of the calculation may be correct, a subsequent error leads to this result.\n\nThe distance between adjacent nodes is correctly calculated as:\n30 cm / 3 intervals = 10 cm per interval.\nSo, \u03bb/2 = 10 cm.\n\nThe error occurs if this distance (10 cm) is mistaken for the full wavelength (\u03bb) instead of half a wavelength (\u03bb/2).\nIncorrect assumption: \u03bb = 10 cm = 0.1 m.\n\nCalculating the frequency with this incorrect wavelength:\nf = v / \u03bb = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.1 m = 3300 Hz\n\nThe correct relationship is that the wavelength is twice the internodal distance (\u03bb = 2 \u00d7 10 cm = 20 cm), which leads to the correct frequency of 1650 Hz.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis answer is incorrect and results from compounding the error described for option C. It is double the frequency of option C, indicating a further miscalculation.\n\nThis value would be obtained if, after incorrectly determining the wavelength to be 10 cm (0.1 m) as in the reasoning for option C, this value was then incorrectly halved again before calculating the frequency.\n\nIncorrect calculation steps:\n1.  Internodal distance = 10 cm.\n2.  Mistakenly assume \u03bb = 10 cm = 0.1 m.\n3.  Further mistake, for example, using \u03bb/2 in the formula instead of \u03bb, but taking \u03bb as 0.1m, so calculating with 0.05m.\n    Effective wavelength used in calculation = 0.1 m / 2 = 0.05 m.\n\nCalculating the frequency with this value:\nf = v / \u03bb_effective = 330 m s\u207b\u00b9 / 0.05 m = 6600 Hz\n\nThis result is based on multiple conceptual and calculation errors regarding the properties of stationary waves. The correct wavelength is 0.20 m, derived from the fact that the internodal distance (10 cm) is only half a wavelength."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_512.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "32 there is a current in a resistor for a short time interval.\nwhich statement about the total charge that passes through the resistor is correct?\na_ltcan take any value.\nb_itis an integer multiple of the elementary charge.\nc_itis the elementary charge.\nd _itis the rate of flow of the current.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: B\n\nElectric charge is a fundamental property of matter that is quantized. This means that charge exists in discrete, indivisible packets. The smallest unit of free charge is the elementary charge, denoted by *e*, which is the magnitude of the charge on a single electron or proton (approximately 1.60 x 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C).\n\nIn a resistor, electric current is constituted by the flow of a vast number of charge carriers, which are free electrons. Each electron carries a charge of -*e*. The total charge (Q) that passes a point in the resistor is the sum of the charges of all the individual electrons that have moved past that point. Since the number of electrons (n) must be an integer (1, 2, 3, ...), the total charge is given by the equation Q = n * e. Therefore, the total charge that passes through the resistor must be an integer multiple of the elementary charge.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A. It can take any value.**\n    This statement is incorrect because it implies that charge is a continuous quantity. Due to the principle of charge quantization, the total charge cannot take on any arbitrary value. For instance, a total charge of 1.5 *e* is physically impossible, as it would require the flow of one and a half electrons, which cannot happen. The total charge is restricted to discrete values that are integer multiples of the elementary charge *e*.\n\n*   **C. It is the elementary charge.**\n    This statement is incorrect. While the elementary charge (*e*) is the fundamental unit of charge, a measurable current flowing for even a short time interval involves the passage of a very large number of electrons. The total charge is the cumulative charge of all these electrons. For the total charge to be equal to the elementary charge, exactly one electron would have to pass through the resistor in the given time interval. This is not representative of a typical electric current.\n\n*   **D. It is the rate of flow of the current.**\n    This statement confuses the definitions of charge and current. Electric current (I) is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge (Q), expressed as I = dQ/dt. The question asks for a property of the total charge (Q) itself, not its rate of flow. The \"rate of flow of the current\" would be the rate at which the current changes (dI/dt), which is a different physical quantity altogether and is not equivalent to total charge."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_513.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "33 the potential difference v across a filament lamp is slowly raised from zero to its normal\noperating value.\nwhich graph represents the variation with v of the current j in the lamp?\na b cc d\ni i va hg\n0 0 0 0\n0 v 0 v 0 v 0 v", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA filament lamp is a non-ohmic conductor. Its resistance is not constant but changes with temperature.\n\n1.  **Relationship between V, I, and Temperature:** According to Ohm's Law, current *I* is related to potential difference *V* and resistance *R* by the equation *I* = *V*/*R*. When a potential difference is applied across the filament, current flows, causing the filament to heat up due to the Joule heating effect.\n2.  **Resistance of a Metal Filament:** The filament in a lamp is a metal wire (typically tungsten). For metallic conductors, resistance increases as temperature increases.\n3.  **Analysis of the I-V Graph:** The graph plots current *I* (on the y-axis) against potential difference *V* (on the x-axis). The gradient of this graph at any point is d*I*/d*V*. For an ohmic conductor, *I* = *V*/*R*, so the gradient is 1/*R*. For a non-ohmic conductor, the resistance *R* itself changes, so the gradient of the I-V graph will change.\n4.  **Behaviour of the Filament Lamp:** As the potential difference *V* is increased from zero, the current *I* increases. This causes the temperature of the filament to rise, which in turn increases its resistance *R*. Since the gradient of the I-V graph is approximately 1/*R*, an increasing resistance *R* means that the gradient of the curve must decrease.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Graph A correctly shows a curve that starts at the origin (zero current at zero voltage) and has a gradient that continuously decreases as the voltage increases. This represents the increasing resistance of the hot filament.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **B:** This graph is a straight line passing through the origin. This represents a constant gradient (*I*/*V* = constant), which means the resistance (*R* = *V*/*I*) is constant. This is the characteristic of an ohmic conductor, which a filament lamp is not.\n*   **C:** This graph shows that as the potential difference *V* increases from zero, the current *I* decreases from a very high value. This is physically incorrect for a lamp; current should be zero at zero voltage and should increase as voltage increases.\n*   **D:** This graph shows a curve where the gradient increases as the voltage *V* increases. An increasing gradient (d*I*/d*V*) implies that the resistance is decreasing.

The law states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering any junction in a circuit is zero. Since electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge (I = dQ/dt), this law implies that charge does not accumulate at or disappear from a junction. The total amount of charge flowing into a junction per unit time must equal the total amount of charge flowing out of it per unit time.\n\n**Kirchhoff's Second Law** (also known as the loop rule or voltage law) is an application of the **conservation of energy**. It states that for any closed loop in a circuit, the algebraic sum of the electromotive forces (e.m.f.s) is equal to the algebraic sum of the potential differences (p.d.s). Electromotive force represents the energy supplied per unit charge by a source, while potential difference represents the energy converted or dissipated per unit charge by a component.

Kirchhoff's first law is based on the conservation of charge, not power.

Resistance is a property of a material or component that quantifies its opposition to the flow of current; it is not a conserved quantity in the sense that Kirchhoff's laws describe.

The correct method requires using the formula *E* = *I*(*R* + *r*) to find the total resistance first, and then subtracting the external resistance.\n\n#### B: 0.20 \u03a9\n\nThis incorrect value arises from a common misconception. The potential difference across the internal resistance, known as the \"lost volts\" (*V*<sub>lost</sub>), is calculated as *E* - *V*<sub>terminal</sub>. The terminal potential difference (*V*<sub>terminal</sub>) across the external resistor is *I* * R* = 0.26 A \u00d7 5.0 \u03a9 = 1.30 V. Therefore, the lost volts are 1.50 V - 1.30 V = 0.20 V. This value, 0.20 V, represents the potential difference across the internal resistance, not the resistance itself. The internal resistance *r* is found by dividing the lost volts by the current: *r* = 0.20 V / 0.26 A = 0.77 \u03a9.\n\n#### C: 0.39 \u03a9\n\nThis value is obtained by incorrectly multiplying the e.m.f. by the current: 1.50 V \u00d7 0.26 A = 0.39. This calculation actually yields the total power supplied by the cell in watts (P = EI), not the internal resistance in ohms.

The process described is beta-plus (\u03b2\u207a) decay, a type of radioactive decay mediated by the weak nuclear force. In \u03b2\u207a decay, a proton within an atomic nucleus is converted into a neutron. To conserve charge, a positron (a positively charged anti-electron, denoted \u03b2\u207a or e\u207a) is emitted from the nucleus.\n\nThe fundamental equation for this transformation is:\np \u2192 n + e\u207a + \u03bd\u2091\n\nwhere:\n*   p is a proton\n*   n is a neutron\n*   e\u207a is a positron (the \u03b2\u207a particle)\n*   \u03bd\u2091 is an electron neutrino\n\nThe emission of the electron neutrino is essential to conserve a fundamental quantity known as the lepton number. Leptons (like electrons and neutrinos) have a lepton number of +1, while anti-leptons (like positrons and antineutrinos) have a lepton number of -1. Baryons (like protons and neutrons) have a lepton number of 0.\n\n*   **Initial state:** A proton has a lepton number of 0.\n*   **Final state:** For the total lepton number to remain 0, the sum of the lepton numbers of the products must be zero. A positron (e\u207a) has a lepton number of -1. Therefore, a particle with a lepton number of +1 must also be emitted. This particle is the electron neutrino (\u03bd\u2091).\n\nThus, in every \u03b2\u207a decay, a positron is accompanied by an electron neutrino.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. antineutrino**\n\nAn antineutrino is emitted during beta-minus (\u03b2\u207b) decay, not beta-plus (\u03b2\u207a) decay. In \u03b2\u207b decay, a neutron transforms into a proton, and an electron (\u03b2\u207b particle) is emitted. To conserve the lepton number in that process, an electron antineutrino (which has a lepton number of -1) is emitted along with the electron (which has a lepton number of +1). The total lepton number remains zero. Since the question specifies \u03b2\u207a decay, the emission of an antineutrino is incorrect.\n\n**B. electron**\n\nAn electron is a negatively charged particle, also known as a beta-minus (\u03b2\u207b) particle in the context of nuclear decay. The process described is \u03b2\u207a emission, which involves the emission of a positron (the antiparticle of an electron), not an electron. Emitting an electron would violate the conservation of electric charge in this specific decay, as the transformation of a proton (+1 charge) to a neutron (0 charge) requires the emission of a particle with a +1 charge, which is the positron.\n\n**D. neutron**\n\nIn beta-plus (\u03b2\u207a) decay, a neutron is *produced* within the nucleus from the transformation of a proton. However, this neutron remains bound within the newly formed daughter nucleus (beryllium in this case); it is not an *emitted* particle that leaves the atom. The particles that are emitted and escape the nucleus are the positron and the neutrino. Neutron emission is a different type of radioactive decay that occurs in some very neutron-rich isotopes, but it is not a feature of \u03b2\u207a decay."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_521.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "1. which statement about physical quantities is correct?\na aphysical quantity does not always have a magnitude or a unit.\nb_ apbhysical quantity must always have a magnitude but does not always have a unit.\nc_ a physical quantity must always have a unit but does not always have a magnitude.\nda physical quantity must always have a magnitude and a unit.", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nA physical quantity is a property of a phenomenon, body, or substance that can be quantified by measurement. By definition, any measurement must include two components:\n\n1.  **Magnitude:** A numerical value that represents the size or amount of the quantity.\n2.  **Unit:** A standard of measurement that provides context and meaning to the numerical value.\n\nFor example, to describe a length, one might say it is 2 metres.

These quantities are ratios of two other quantities that have the same units. For example, strain is the ratio of change in length to original length (e.g., metres/metres). The units cancel, resulting in a unit of '1'. Thus, a strain of 0.05 has a magnitude (0.05) and a unit (1, or dimensionless).

While a physical quantity must indeed have a magnitude, it also requires a unit for its meaning to be unambiguous. A value of '10' is meaningless without a unit; it could be 10 metres, 10 seconds, or 10 kilograms.

A 60 cm sphere has a significant size, comparable to a large exercise ball. Copper is a dense metal (estimated density \u2248 9000 kg/m\u00b3). A volume of copper corresponding to a mass of 0.1 kg would be V = mass/density = 0.1 kg / 9000 kg/m\u00b3 \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b3. This volume corresponds to a sphere with a radius of approximately 1.4 cm, which is drastically smaller than the given 30 cm radius.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nA mass of 10 kg is also a significant underestimate. While 10 kg is a substantial mass (equivalent to about 10 litres of water), copper is nearly nine times denser than water. The calculated volume of the sphere is approximately 0.108 m\u00b3 (or 108 litres). A sphere of water of this size would have a mass of about 108 kg.

According to Archimedes' principle, the upthrust (or buoyant force) exerted on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. The formula for upthrust (U) is:\n\n*   **U = \u03c1_fluid \u00d7 V_submerged \u00d7 g**\n\nWhere:\n*   **\u03c1_fluid** is the density of the fluid.\n*   **V_submerged** is the volume of the object that is submerged in the fluid.\n*   **g** is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nIn this scenario:\n1.  All four cuboids are immersed in the same fluid (water), so **\u03c1_fluid** (which is \u03c1) is the same for all of them.\n2.  The problem states that the cuboids have \"identical lengths, breadths and heights,\" which means they have identical volumes (V).\n3.  All cuboids are fully immersed in the water, so the volume of water displaced (**V_submerged**) is equal to the total volume (V) of each cuboid.\n\nSince **\u03c1_fluid**, **V_submerged**, and **g** are the same for all four cuboids, the upthrust exerted on each cuboid is identical. The density of the material from which each cuboid is made affects its weight, but it does not affect the upthrust it experiences when fully submerged.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **B. The upthrust of the water on W is twice the upthrust of the water on X.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Upthrust is determined by the volume of the displaced fluid, not the density of the object itself. While the density of cuboid W (4\u03c1) is twice the density of cuboid X (2\u03c1), this means the *weight* of W is twice the weight of X. However, since both cuboids have the same volume and are fully submerged, they displace the same volume of water and therefore experience the same upthrust.\n\n*   **C. The upthrust of the water on X is twice the upthrust of the water on W.**\n    This statement is incorrect for the same reason as option B. The upthrust depends on the volume of displaced fluid, which is identical for both cuboids X and W as they have the same volume and are both fully submerged. Therefore, the upthrusts are equal.\n\n*   **D. The upthrust of the water on Y is zero.**\n    This statement is incorrect. An upthrust of zero would only occur if the object displaced no fluid (i.e., it was not in the water). Cuboid Y is fully immersed, displacing a volume of water equal to its own volume. This displacement results in a non-zero upthrust. In the specific case of cuboid Y, its density (\u03c1) is equal to the density of the water. This means its weight is exactly equal to the upthrust, a condition known as neutral buoyancy. While the net force on it (excluding the rod) would be zero, the upthrust itself is a distinct, non-zero force."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_526.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "6 = in which example is it not possible for the underlined object to be in equilibrium?\na an aeroplane climbs at a steady rate.\nb_ an aeroplane tows a glider at a constant altitude.\nc a speedboat changes direction at a constant speed.\nd_ two boats tow a ship into harbour.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**C. A speedboat changes direction at a constant speed.**\n\nAn object is in equilibrium only when the net force acting upon it is zero. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, this occurs when an object is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity.\n\nVelocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude (speed) and direction. For velocity to be constant, both the speed and the direction of motion must remain unchanged.\n\nIn this case, the speedboat is changing its direction. Even though its speed is constant, its velocity is changing because its direction is changing. A change in velocity per unit time is, by definition, acceleration. According to Newton's Second Law (F = ma), if an object has a non-zero acceleration, there must be a non-zero net force acting on it. An object with a net force acting on it is not in equilibrium. Therefore, it is impossible for the speedboat to be in equilibrium while changing direction.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. An aeroplane climbs at a steady rate.**\n\nThe term \"steady rate\" implies that the aeroplane is moving with a constant velocity. It is travelling in a straight line (an upward, inclined path) at a constant speed. Since its velocity is constant, its acceleration is zero. For the acceleration to be zero, the net force on the aeroplane must be zero. This means all the forces acting on it\u2014thrust, drag, lift, and weight\u2014are balanced. Thus, the aeroplane is in equilibrium.\n\n**B. An aeroplane tows a glider at a constant altitude.**\n\nIf a glider is being towed at a constant altitude and, as implied, at a constant speed in a straight line, it is moving with a constant velocity. Constant velocity means there is zero acceleration. Consequently, the net force acting on the glider is zero. The forces of tension from the tow rope, lift, drag, and weight are all in balance. Therefore, the glider can be in equilibrium.\n\n**D. Two boats tow a ship into harbour.**\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where it is possible for the ship to be in equilibrium. For instance, the boats could be towing the ship at a slow, constant velocity (constant speed and constant direction). In such a case, the ship's acceleration would be zero, meaning the net force on it is zero. The combined towing forces from the two boats would be balanced by the resistive forces (drag) from the water. As equilibrium is possible, this option is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_527.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "7 two identical balls are projected vertically upwards from ground level with the same initial\nvelocity. ball x is in a vacuum and ball y is in air.\nwhich statement about the motion of the balls is correct?\na_ ball x reaches a greater maximum height and in a longer time than ball y.\nbball x reaches a greater maximum height and in a shorter time than ball y.\nc_ ball y reaches a greater maximum height and in a longer time than ball x.\nd_ ball y reaches a greater maximum height and in a shorter time than ball x.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis question compares the vertical motion of an object in a vacuum (Ball X) with that of an object in air (Ball Y), focusing on the journey to maximum height.\n\n1.  **Forces on Ball X (in a vacuum):** The only force acting on Ball X throughout its motion is its weight (due to gravity), which acts vertically downwards. This results in a constant downward acceleration equal to the acceleration of free fall, *g*.\n\n2.  **Forces on Ball Y (in air):** As Ball Y moves upwards, it is subject to two downward forces: its weight and air resistance. Air resistance is a frictional force that always opposes motion. Therefore, on the upward journey, both gravity and air resistance act in the same downward direction.\n\n3.  **Net Force and Acceleration:** The net downward force on Ball Y is the sum of its weight and the force of air resistance. This is greater than the net force on Ball X (which is just its weight). According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), a greater net force results in a greater acceleration (in this case, deceleration). Thus, Ball Y experiences a greater downward acceleration than Ball X.\n\n4.  **Maximum Height and Time:**\n    *   **Time:** Since both balls start with the same initial upward velocity but Ball Y has a greater deceleration, its velocity will decrease to zero more quickly. Consequently, Ball Y takes a shorter time to reach its maximum height, meaning Ball X takes a longer time.\n    *   **Height:** Because Ball Y decelerates more rapidly, it will cover less vertical distance before its velocity becomes zero. Therefore, Ball X, with its smaller deceleration, will travel to a greater maximum height.\n\nIn summary, Ball X reaches a greater maximum height and takes a longer time to do so compared to Ball Y.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Ball X reaches a greater maximum height and in a shorter time than ball Y.**\nThis statement is partially correct in that Ball X does reach a greater maximum height. However, it is incorrect about the time taken. The presence of air resistance on Ball Y causes a larger deceleration, meaning it stops its upward motion more quickly than Ball X. Therefore, Ball X takes a *longer*, not shorter, time to reach its peak.\n\n**C. Ball Y reaches a greater maximum height and in a longer time than ball X.**\nThis statement is incorrect on both counts. The additional downward force of air resistance on Ball Y increases its rate of deceleration. This greater deceleration causes it to stop sooner (shorter time) and at a lower altitude (lesser maximum height) compared to Ball X, which is only decelerated by gravity.\n\n**D. Ball Y reaches a greater maximum height and in a shorter time than ball X.**\nThis statement is partially correct in that Ball Y does take a shorter time to reach its maximum height. However, it is incorrect about the maximum height achieved. The force of air resistance acts against the upward motion of Ball Y, doing negative work and reducing its kinetic energy more rapidly than gravity alone. This results in Ball Y reaching a *lesser*, not greater, maximum height than Ball X."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_528.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "8 the graph shows the variation of velocity with time for a stone that falls from a bridge into a lake\nand sinks to the bottom of the lake.\nvelocity\n0 ;\n\n0 time\nwhat can be deduced about the motion of the stone?\na_ terminal velocity was reached in air.\nb_ the acceleration in air was decreasing with increasing time.\nc_ the distance travelled in water was greater than the distance travelled in air.\nd_ the rate of change of velocity in air was constant.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe acceleration of an object is represented by the gradient (slope) of its velocity-time graph. The first section of the graph, representing the stone falling through the air, is a curve. The gradient of this curve is initially steep and becomes progressively less steep as time increases. This indicates that the acceleration is positive (velocity is increasing) but its magnitude is decreasing over time. This occurs because as the stone's velocity increases, the opposing force of air resistance also increases, reducing the net downward force and thus the acceleration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Terminal velocity was reached in air.**\nTerminal velocity is the constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (like air) through which it is falling equals the force of gravity. On a velocity-time graph, terminal velocity is indicated by the graph becoming a horizontal line, meaning the gradient (acceleration) is zero. In the first part of the graph, the velocity is continuously increasing, and the gradient, while decreasing, is always positive. Therefore, terminal velocity was not reached in the air.\n\n**C: The distance travelled in water was greater than the distance travelled in air.**\nThe distance travelled is represented by the area under the velocity-time graph. The graph can be divided into two main sections: the fall through the air (the initial curve) and the fall through the water (the section after the sharp drop in velocity). By visual inspection, the area under the initial curve (distance in air) is significantly larger than the area under the subsequent part of the graph (distance in water). The stone reaches a much higher velocity in air and travels for a period of time, resulting in a large area. In water, the velocity is much lower, leading to a smaller area and thus a shorter distance travelled.\n\n**D: The rate of change of velocity in air was constant.**\nThe rate of change of velocity is acceleration. For the acceleration to be constant, the velocity-time graph must be a straight line with a constant gradient. The section of the graph representing the stone's motion in air is a curve, not a straight line. The gradient is continuously decreasing.

Mathematically, this is expressed as F = \u0394p / \u0394t.\n\nOn a momentum-time graph, the rate of change of momentum is represented by the gradient (slope) of the line. The question asks for the resultant force at t = 10 s. This time falls within the first segment of the graph, from t = 0 s to t = 20 s.\n\nIn this segment, the graph is a straight line, which indicates a constant resultant force. To find this force, we calculate the gradient of this line segment:\n\n1.  **Identify the change in momentum (\u0394p):**\n    The vertical axis is labelled `p / 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9`. At t = 20 s, the value on the axis is 4. Therefore, the momentum p is 4 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. At t = 0 s, the momentum is 0.\n    \u0394p = (4 \u00d7 10\u2074 - 0) kg m s\u207b\u00b9 = 40,000 kg m s\u207b\u00b9.\n\n2.  **Identify the change in time (\u0394t):**\n    The time interval for this change is from 0 s to 20 s.\n    \u0394t = 20 s - 0 s = 20 s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the resultant force (F):**\n    F = \u0394p / \u0394t = 40,000 kg m s\u207b\u00b9 / 20 s = 2000 N.\n\nSince the force is constant throughout this interval, the resultant force at t = 10 s is 2000 N.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nA resultant force of 0 N would mean that the momentum of the car is constant (i.e., the rate of change of momentum is zero). On the graph, this corresponds to a section with a zero gradient (a horizontal line). This occurs in the time interval from t = 20 s to t = 50 s. Since t = 10 s falls in the interval where momentum is increasing, the resultant force is not zero.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nA resultant force of 1500 N is incorrect. For the force to be 1500 N during the first 20 seconds, the change in momentum would need to be \u0394p = F \u00d7 \u0394t = 1500 N \u00d7 20 s = 30,000 kg m s\u207b\u00b9. This would mean the peak value on the `p / 10\u2074` axis should be 3, not 4 as shown in the graph. The calculation based on the provided graph data does not yield 1500 N.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nA resultant force of 4000 N is incorrect for the time t = 10 s. This value is the magnitude of the resultant force during the deceleration phase of the car's motion, from t = 50 s to t = 60 s.\nFor that interval:\nF = \u0394p / \u0394t = (0 - 4 \u00d7 10\u2074 kg m s\u207b\u00b9) / (60 s - 50 s) = -40,000 / 10 = -4000 N.\nThe magnitude is 4000 N, but this applies to the final 10 seconds of motion, not at t = 10 s."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_530.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "10 two objects x and y form an isolated system. x and y collide and then separate. the mass of x\nis greater than the mass of y.\nwhich statement about the collision is correct?\na_ the change of momentum of y is greater than the change of momentum of x.\nb_ the force on y is greater than the force on x.\nc_ the forces that x and y exert on each other act for the same length of time.\nd_ the forces that x and y exert on each other are gravitational forces only.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer C\n\nThis statement is correct based on the nature of an interaction or collision. The forces that objects X and Y exert on each other form a Newton's Third Law action-reaction pair. These forces exist only for the duration that the two objects are interacting (i.e., in contact). This period of interaction, or collision time, is inherently the same for both objects. The force from X on Y cannot exist for a different amount of time than the force from Y on X, as they are two aspects of a single event.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer A\n\nThis statement contradicts the principle of conservation of linear momentum. For an isolated system (one with no external forces), the total momentum is conserved. This means the total change in momentum of the system is zero.\n\nLet \u0394p_X be the change in momentum of object X and \u0394p_Y be the change in momentum of object Y.\nFor the system, the total change in momentum is:\n\u0394p_system = \u0394p_X + \u0394p_Y = 0\n\nTherefore, \u0394p_X = -\u0394p_Y.\n\nThis equation shows that the change in momentum of object X is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the change in momentum of object Y. The magnitudes of their changes in momentum are exactly the same, not one greater than the other.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer B\n\nThis statement contradicts Newton's Third Law of Motion. The law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. During the collision, the force exerted by object X on object Y is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by object Y on object X. These two forces constitute an action-reaction pair. Therefore, the magnitude of the force on Y is equal to the magnitude of the force on X. The information that the mass of X is greater than the mass of Y does not change this fundamental law; it only implies that the resulting acceleration of the less massive object (Y) will be greater.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThe forces involved in a collision between two objects are primarily contact forces. These forces arise from the electromagnetic repulsion between the electron clouds of the atoms at the surfaces of the objects. While it is true that a gravitational force exists between any two objects with mass, this force is extremely weak and completely negligible compared to the very large contact forces that act during the brief moment of a collision.

An inelastic collision is defined as a collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved.

In this scenario, with significant air resistance, there are two forces to consider: the gravitational force (weight) and the force of air resistance (drag).\n\n1.  **Gravitational Force (Weight):** This force acts vertically downwards and has a constant magnitude, `W = mg`, throughout the flight.\n2.  **Air Resistance (Drag):** This force always opposes the direction of motion.

However, due to the constant downward acceleration, the ball's speed is less than its initial speed. As air resistance is proportional to speed, the force of air resistance is smaller than it was at the start. Consequently, the resultant force (`Weight + Air Resistance`) is smaller than the resultant force just after release.\n\n**C: when the tennis ball is at its highest point**\nAt the very peak of its trajectory, the tennis ball's instantaneous velocity is zero. Since the force of air resistance depends on speed, there is no air resistance at this point. The only force acting on the ball is its weight. The resultant force is therefore equal to the weight, which is significantly less than the sum of the weight and air resistance experienced on the way up.\n\n**D: when the tennis ball is halfway from its highest point on the way down**\nDuring its descent, the ball is moving downwards. The weight continues to act downwards, but the air resistance now opposes the downward motion, meaning it acts upwards.

A couple is a pair of forces that act in the same direction.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining characteristic of a couple is that the two forces are in opposite directions.

A couple is a pair of forces that act to produce a resultant force.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A fundamental property of a couple is that the resultant force is zero.

The beam's length is 0.60 m, so its centre of mass is at 0.30 m from either end. From the diagram, the pivot P is 0.40 m from the left end. Therefore, the centre of mass is to the left of the pivot. The lever arm is r_beam = 0.40 m - 0.30 m = 0.10 m. The force (weight) is F_beam = m_beam * g = 1.4g.\n    *   **Clockwise forces:** This force tends to rotate the beam clockwise around P.\n        *   **6.0 kg load:** The force (weight) is F\u2082 = m\u2082g = 6.0g. The lever arm is r\u2082 = 0.15 m.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total anticlockwise and clockwise torques:**\n    *   **Anticlockwise torque (\u03c4_acw):**\n        \u03c4_acw = (F\u2081 \u00d7 r\u2081) + (F_beam \u00d7 r_beam)\n        \u03c4_acw = (3.0g \u00d7 0.35) + (1.4g \u00d7 0.10) = 1.05g + 0.14g = 1.19g N\u00b7m\n    *   **Clockwise torque (\u03c4_cw):**\n        \u03c4_cw = F\u2082 \u00d7 r\u2082\n        \u03c4_cw = 6.0g \u00d7 0.15 = 0.90g N\u00b7m\n\n3.  **Calculate the net resultant torque:**\n    *   Net Torque (\u03c4_net) = \u03c4_acw - \u03c4_cw\n    *   \u03c4_net = 1.19g - 0.90g = 0.29g N\u00b7m\n    *   The positive result indicates a net anticlockwise torque.\n\n4.  **Determine the required torque for equilibrium:**\n    *   To counteract this net anticlockwise torque, an equal and opposite (i.e., clockwise) torque must be applied.\n    *   Required Torque = 0.29g\n    *   Using the acceleration due to gravity, g \u2248 9.81 m/s\u00b2:\n    *   Required Torque = 0.29 \u00d7 9.81 \u2248 2.8449 N\u00b7m\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the required torque is 2.8 N\u00b7m.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 0.010 N\u00b7m**\nThis answer is incorrect and likely arises from miscalculating the position of the beam's centre of mass. If the centre of mass were assumed to be 0.10 m to the *right* of the pivot instead of the left, its torque would be clockwise. The net torque would then be calculated as (1.05g) - (0.90g + 0.14g) = 0.01g. This calculation error stems from an incorrect determination of the lever arm's direction for the beam's weight.\n\n**B: 0.10 N\u00b7m**\nThis value results from the same conceptual error as in option A (placing the beam's centre of mass on the wrong side of the pivot), but with the additional step of approximating the acceleration due to gravity, g, as 10 m/s\u00b2. The net torque would be calculated as 0.01g, and 0.01 \u00d7 10 m/s\u00b2 = 0.1 N\u00b7m. The primary error is misinterpreting the position of the centre of mass relative to the pivot.\n\n**C: 0.29 N\u00b7m**\nThis answer represents the numerical coefficient of the net torque calculation before multiplying by the acceleration due to gravity, *g*. The net torque was correctly found to be 0.29g N\u00b7m. However, torque is a force multiplied by a distance, and force is mass times acceleration (F=ma). This answer incorrectly omits the factor of *g* (acceleration) from the final calculation, leading to a value with incorrect units and magnitude."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_535.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "15 the diagrams show three rigid objects p, q and r being subjected to different combinations of\nforces.\np q r\n30\u00b0 30\u00b0\n\n80n 80n 50n \\\\' \u2018| 50n\n20n 10n \u2014\n\n60n 60n\n\n100n\n\nwhich objects are in equilibrium?\na pandq\nb pandr\nc qandr\nd_ none of them", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "For a rigid body to be in equilibrium, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Translational Equilibrium:** The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be zero.

For example, if one were to mistakenly use the lowest dashed line as the reference level and compare the total height of the left column (`3x`) to the height of the liquid Q column on the right (`2x`), they might set up an incorrect balance equation like `(3x)\u03c1_P = (2x)\u03c1_Q`. This would lead to `\u03c1_P / \u03c1_Q = 2/3`. This is incorrect because the pressure balance must be established at the interface of the two liquids, not at an arbitrary level, and the column on the left is composed of both liquid P and liquid Q.\n\n**C: 3/2**\nThis answer could arise from a combination of errors. For instance, if the height of the column of P was correctly identified as `h_P = 2x` but the height of the balancing column of Q was incorrectly taken as the total marked height `3x` (i.e., `h_Q = 3x`), the pressure balance equation would be written as `(2x)\u03c1_P = (3x)\u03c1_Q`. This incorrectly yields the ratio `\u03c1_P / \u03c1_Q = 3/2`. The correct height of the column of liquid Q that balances the column of liquid P is the vertical distance from the interface to the free surface of Q, which is `x`.\n\n**D: 2**\nThis answer is the reciprocal of the correct ratio. It typically arises from an algebraic error when rearranging the final equation or by misinterpreting the relationship `h_P \u03c1_P = h_Q \u03c1_Q`. After substituting the heights `h_P = 2x` and `h_Q = x`, the correct equation is `2\u03c1_P = \u03c1_Q`. A common mistake is to incorrectly rearrange this to `\u03c1_P / \u03c1_Q = 2`. This answer would also be obtained if one calculated the ratio of the density of Q to the density of P (`\u03c1_Q / \u03c1_P`) instead of the requested `\u03c1_P / \u03c1_Q`."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_537.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "17 a stone of mass 0.30kg is thrown vertically downwards with a speed of 20ms\u2122 from a height of\n12m above the ground. it falls vertically until it hits the ground. air resistance is negligible.\nwhat is the kinetic energy of the stone just before it hits the ground?\na 25j b 35j cc 60j d 95j", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of non-conservative forces like air resistance, the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant.

Its initial kinetic energy is 60 J. As the stone accelerates downwards due to gravity, its speed increases, and therefore its kinetic energy must be greater than 60 J just before it hits the ground.\n\n**B: 35 J**\nThis value is approximately the amount of gravitational potential energy the stone loses as it falls (GPE = mgh \u2248 35.3 J). This would be the final kinetic energy only if the stone were dropped from rest (initial velocity = 0). However, the stone was thrown with an initial kinetic energy of 60 J. The final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the kinetic energy gained from the conversion of potential energy.\n\n**C: 60 J**\nThis is the initial kinetic energy of the stone (KE_i = \u00bd * 0.30 kg * (20 m/s)\u00b2 = 60 J).

Work is done when a force causes displacement in the direction of the force. The weight *W* is a vertically downward force. The displacement *p* is horizontal. Since the force of gravity (*W*) is perpendicular to the horizontal displacement (*p*), the work done by gravity over this horizontal distance is zero. The expression *Wp* would represent the work done by a horizontal force of magnitude *W* acting over a distance *p*, which does not correspond to the physical situation described.\n\n#### B: W(p + q)\n\nThis is incorrect because it involves the scalar addition of displacement components. Displacement is a vector quantity, and the total work done is not found by multiplying the force by the sum of the magnitudes of its perpendicular displacement components. Work is calculated based on the displacement in the direction of the force. The only component of displacement in the direction of the force that opposes gravity is the vertical displacement *q*.\n\n#### D: Wr\n\nThis is incorrect.

For an object starting from rest, the kinetic energy it gains is equal to the work done on it. The derivation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Start with the definition of work done (Equation 1):** The work done (W) by a constant force (F) moving an object over a distance (s) is given by W = Fs.

The equation for kinetic energy relates mass and velocity, not time. The derivation requires a way to link the product of acceleration and displacement (as) to the final velocity (v). The power equation introduces the variable time (t) and does not provide this link, making the derivation of E\u2096 = \u00bdmv\u00b2 impossible with this set of equations.\n\n#### Option C: 1, 3, and 4\n\nThis combination is incorrect because it omits Newton's Second Law (F = ma). This law is essential for introducing the mass (m) of the object into the derivation. Without F = ma, there is no way to relate the force (F) in the work equation (W = Fs) to the mass of the object, which is a fundamental component of the kinetic energy formula.\n\n#### Option D: 2, 3, and 4\n\nThis combination is incorrect because it omits the equation for work done (W = Fs). The concept of work done is the foundation of this derivation, as it establishes the direct link between the mechanical action (force applied over a distance) and the resulting change in energy. Without W = Fs, there is no starting point to connect the principles of force and motion to the concept of kinetic energy."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_541.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 the force\u2014extension graph of a metal wire is shown.\nat which point on the graph does the metal wire stop obeying hooke\u2019s law?\nforce d\ncc\nb\na\n0\n0 extension", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nHooke's Law states that for an elastic material, the applied force is directly proportional to the extension, provided the elastic limit is not exceeded. On a force-extension graph, this direct proportionality is represented by a straight line passing through the origin. The gradient of this line is constant and represents the force constant (k) of the material.\n\nThe graph shows a straight line from the origin up to point A. In this region, the force and extension are directly proportional, and the wire is obeying Hooke's Law. At point A, the graph begins to curve, indicating that the relationship is no longer linear. This point is known as the limit of proportionality. Beyond this point, an increase in force produces a proportionally larger increase in extension. Therefore, point A is the point at which the wire stops obeying Hooke's Law.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nPoint B is located on the curved section of the graph, which signifies a non-linear relationship between force and extension. This means that the wire is no longer obeying Hooke's Law at this point. However, the question asks for the point at which the wire *stops* obeying the law. The deviation from the straight-line behaviour, and thus the cessation of obedience to Hooke's Law, occurs earlier at point A, the limit of proportionality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nPoint C lies further along the curved portion of the graph, well beyond the limit of proportionality (point A). At point C, the wire is undergoing significant plastic deformation, meaning it will not return to its original length if the force is removed. The material ceased to obey Hooke's Law long before this point was reached. Point C is close to the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), which is the maximum force the wire can withstand before it begins to neck and weaken.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nPoint D is in a region of the graph where the force required to continue extending the wire is decreasing. This occurs after the wire has passed its Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and is undergoing 'necking' (localised thinning) before it fractures. This behaviour is characteristic of plastic deformation and is fundamentally different from the elastic, proportional behaviour described by Hooke's Law.

This represents the total energy supplied to the cord.\n2.  **Work Done during Contraction:** The work done *by* the rubber cord as it contracts is equal to the area under the lower curve (the contraction curve).

The difference between these two amounts of work is represented by the shaded area enclosed by the loop.\n4.  **Conservation of Energy:** According to the principle of conservation of energy, this net work done on the cord over a complete cycle cannot be lost; it must be converted into another form of energy.

The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\n1.  **Principle of the Doppler Effect:** When a sound source moves *away* from a stationary observer, the wavefronts are stretched out, meaning the time between consecutive wavefronts arriving at the observer increases. This results in the observer detecting a sound with a longer wavelength and, consequently, a lower frequency (lower pitch). Conversely, when a source moves *towards* an observer, the wavefronts are compressed, leading to a higher detected frequency.\n\n2.  **Magnitude of Frequency Change:** The magnitude of the change in frequency is proportional to the relative speed of the source along the line connecting the source and the observer. A greater speed of recession (moving away) will cause a larger decrease in the observed frequency.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Option D:** In this case, the sound source is moving directly away from the stationary observer at a speed of 10 m s\u207b\u00b9. This is the fastest speed of recession among all the options. Therefore, this situation will produce the greatest stretching of the wavefronts, resulting in the largest decrease in frequency and the lowest frequency detected by the observer.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nIn this situation, the sound source is moving at 5 m s\u207b\u00b9 directly *towards* the stationary observer. According to the Doppler effect, when a source approaches an observer, the wavefronts are compressed. This leads to a decrease in the observed wavelength and an *increase* in the detected frequency. Therefore, the observer would hear a sound with a higher frequency than the source frequency, not the lowest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThe sound source is moving at 10 m s\u207b\u00b9 directly *towards* the stationary observer. Similar to situation A, the source is approaching the observer, which causes the wavefronts to be compressed and the observed frequency to *increase*. Since the speed of approach (10 m s\u207b\u00b9) is greater than in situation A (5 m s\u207b\u00b9), the increase in frequency will be even more significant. This results in a high observed frequency, not the lowest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nIn this case, the sound source is moving at 5 m s\u207b\u00b9 directly *away* from the stationary observer. As the source is receding, the Doppler effect predicts a *decrease* in the observed frequency. However, the speed of recession is 5 m s\u207b\u00b9. In situation D, the source is also moving away, but at a greater speed of 10 m s\u207b\u00b9. Since the magnitude of the frequency drop is proportional to the speed of recession, the frequency decrease in situation D will be greater than in situation C.

Diffraction is most significant when the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the gap width. To increase the amount of diffraction, one must increase the wavelength or decrease the gap width.\n\nThe relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the wave equation: v = f\u03bb. For water waves in a ripple tank, the wave speed is determined by the depth of the water. As the depth is constant, the wave speed (v) is constant.\n\nAccording to the wave equation, if v is constant, then wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional (\u03bb = v/f). Therefore, decreasing the frequency of the wave will cause an increase in its wavelength. A larger wavelength relative to the fixed gap width will result in a greater amount of diffraction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: decreasing the distance between the bar and the gap**\nThe amount of diffraction depends on the properties of the wave at the gap (specifically its wavelength) and the size of the gap itself. The distance from the wave source to the gap does not alter either the wavelength of the wave or the width of the gap. Therefore, this change has no effect on the amount of diffraction observed.\n\n**C: increasing the amplitude of the wave**\nThe amplitude of a wave is related to its energy, not its wavelength or the degree to which it spreads. While a wave with a larger amplitude would be more intense, the geometric spreading effect of diffraction is independent of amplitude. The amount of diffraction is governed by the ratio of wavelength to gap size, which remains unchanged when the amplitude is increased.\n\n**D: increasing the width of the gap**\nDiffraction becomes less pronounced as the width of the gap becomes much larger than the wavelength. Increasing the width of the gap (a) while the wavelength (\u03bb) remains constant will decrease the ratio \u03bb/a. This leads to *less* diffraction, as the waves will pass through the wider opening with less spreading.

The particles or entities that carry this electric charge are known as charge carriers. In metallic conductors, the charge carriers are delocalised electrons. In other materials, such as electrolytes or plasmas, the charge carriers can be ions (both positive and negative). Consequently, a flow of these charge carriers constitutes an electric current. The magnitude of the current is determined by the amount of charge passing a point per unit of time.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. a flow of energy**\nWhile an electric current is a primary means of transferring energy in an electrical circuit, the current itself is not defined as a flow of energy. Electric current is the flow of charge. The energy transferred is a separate, though related, concept. The rate of energy transfer (power) in a circuit is the product of the potential difference and the current (P = VI). This shows that energy flow is a consequence of the flow of charge, not its definition.\n\n**C. an electron**\nAn electron is a subatomic particle that carries a fundamental negative charge. In metals, electrons are the charge carriers. However, an electric current is the collective, directional *movement* of a large number of these charge carriers, not a single, individual particle. A single electron represents a discrete quantity of charge, whereas current is a macroscopic property describing the rate of flow of that charge.\n\n**D. the charge on a particle**\nThe charge on a particle is a fundamental, static property of that particle (e.g., the elementary charge, *e*). Electric current, however, is a dynamic quantity that describes the *rate of movement* of charge. It quantifies how much charge (\u0394Q) passes a specific point in a conductor over a given time interval (\u0394t), as expressed by the formula I = \u0394Q/\u0394t.

The area of a circular wire is given by *A* = \u03c0(*d*/2)\u00b2, meaning *A* \u221d *d*\u00b2. If one were to incorrectly assume *A* \u221d *d*, halving the diameter would lead to halving the area (*A*\u2082 = 0.5*A*\u2081). The new current would then be calculated as *I*\u2082 = 0.5 * *I*\u2081 * 3 = 1.5*I*. This is incorrect because halving the diameter reduces the area by a factor of (0.5)\u00b2 = 0.25.\n\n#### C) 6*I*\nThis answer stems from a misunderstanding of how the diameter affects the cross-sectional area. The current *I* is proportional to the product of area *A* and drift speed *v*. The new diameter is 0.5*d*, which decreases the area to *A*\u2082 = (0.5)\u00b2*A*\u2081 = 0.25*A*\u2081. The new drift speed is *v*\u2082 = 3*v*\u2081. The correct new current is *I*\u2082 = (0.25) * (3) * *I*\u2081 = 0.75*I*\u2081. Arriving at 6*I* would require the area to increase by a factor of 2, which might arise from erroneously inverting the diameter ratio (1/0.5 = 2). This demonstrates a fundamental error in applying the geometric formula for the area of a circle.\n\n#### D) 12*I*\nThis answer results from a significant error in calculating the change in cross-sectional area. The area *A* is proportional to the diameter squared (*d*\u00b2). Halving the diameter reduces the area by a factor of 0.25. To obtain 12*I*, one would have to incorrectly conclude that the area increases by a factor of 4. This could happen if one mistakenly calculated the area factor as the reciprocal of the diameter change, squared: (1/0.5)\u00b2 = 4. This would lead to a new current of *I*\u2082 = 4 * *I*\u2081 * 3 = 12*I*. This reasoning is flawed, as a smaller diameter must result in a smaller cross-sectional area."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_553.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "33 a fixed resistor and a diode are combined by connecting them in series. the total potential\ndifference v across the combination is varied and the corresponding current i is measured.\nwhich graph could represent the variation of j with v?\n\na b\ni i\n0 0\n0 vv 0 vv\ncc d\nie vg\n0 0\n0 v 0 vv", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer: A\n\nThe circuit consists of a fixed resistor and a diode in series. The overall I-V characteristic is a combination of the individual characteristics of these components.\n\n1.  **Diode Behavior:** An ideal diode acts as a one-way switch for current. It only conducts when it is forward-biased and the potential difference across it exceeds a specific threshold or 'turn-on' voltage (V_on). Below this voltage, its resistance is extremely high, and negligible current flows.\n2.  **Circuit Analysis for Low Voltage (V < V_on):** When the total applied voltage V is less than the diode's turn-on voltage, the diode does not conduct. Since the components are in series, no current (I = 0) can flow through the entire circuit. This is represented by the horizontal segment of the graph along the V-axis, starting from the origin.\n3.  **Circuit Analysis for Higher Voltage (V > V_on):** Once the total applied voltage V exceeds V_on, the diode 'turns on' and begins to conduct. In a simplified model, the voltage drop across the conducting diode remains relatively constant at V_on. The rest of the applied voltage, (V - V_on), is dropped across the fixed resistor.\n4.  **Ohm's Law for the Resistor:** The current I flowing through the circuit is determined by the voltage across the resistor (V_R) and its resistance (R), according to Ohm's Law: I = V_R / R. Since V_R = V - V_on, the relationship becomes I = (V - V_on) / R.\n5.  **Graphical Representation:** The equation I = (1/R)V - (V_on/R) describes a straight line with a positive gradient of 1/R. This line starts at the point where I = 0, which occurs when V = V_on.\n\nTherefore, the correct graph shows zero current until V reaches V_on, after which the current increases linearly with V. Graph A accurately represents this behavior.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis graph incorrectly suggests that for a range of small, positive applied voltages (starting from V > 0), a constant, non-zero current flows. This is physically incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, at V = 0, there is no potential difference to drive a current, so I must be zero. Secondly, the presence of the diode ensures that no significant current flows until its turn-on voltage is surpassed. A constant current region is not characteristic of a resistor-diode series circuit.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis graph shows a linear relationship between current and voltage that has a positive current value when the voltage is zero (a positive I-intercept). This would imply that the circuit provides a current even when no external voltage is applied, which violates the principle of conservation of energy as there is no internal source of electromotive force (e.g., a battery) in the described combination. For a passive circuit like this, the current must be zero when the applied voltage is zero.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis graph correctly shows that the current is zero up to a certain threshold voltage. However, at this threshold voltage, it depicts a discontinuous, vertical jump in current from zero to a finite positive value. In reality, the current in the circuit must change continuously. As the total voltage V increases beyond the turn-on voltage V_on, the current I = (V - V_on) / R starts from zero (at V = V_on) and increases smoothly and linearly. A vertical jump implies an infinite rate of change of current for a finite change in voltage, which is not a characteristic of this circuit."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_554.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "34 the potential difference (p.d.) across a fixed resistor is v. the power dissipated in the resistor\nis 5.0w.\nthe p.d. across the resistor then changes to a new value. with the new p.d. the energy\ntransferred to the resistor in a time of 2.25s is 45.0j.\nwhat is the new p.d. across the resistor?\na oy b 2v cc 3vv d 4v", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe relationship between power (P), potential difference (V), and resistance (R) for a resistor is given by the formula P = V\u00b2/R.

This means that the power dissipated is directly proportional to the square of the potential difference across it (P \u221d V\u00b2).\n\nFirst, let's determine the new power dissipated in the resistor. Power is the rate of energy transfer, given by the formula P = E/t, where E is the energy transferred and t is the time.\n\nGiven:\n*   Energy transferred, E = 45.0 J\n*   Time, t = 2.25 s\n\nThe new power (P\u2082) is:\nP\u2082 = 45.0 J / 2.25 s = 20.0 W\n\nThe initial power (P\u2081) is given as 5.0 W, corresponding to the initial potential difference (V\u2081) of V.

If the new potential difference were V\u2082 = (1/2)V, then because P \u221d V\u00b2, the new power would be (1/2)\u00b2 = 1/4 of the original power. This would mean P\u2082 = (1/4) \u00d7 5.0 W = 1.25 W. However, the calculated new power is 20.0 W. This answer might be chosen if the relationship between power and voltage was incorrectly assumed to be inverse.\n\n#### C: 3V\nThis option is incorrect. If the new potential difference were V\u2082 = 3V, the new power would be 3\u00b2 = 9 times the original power, as P \u221d V\u00b2. This would give a new power of P\u2082 = 9 \u00d7 5.0 W = 45.0 W. The calculated new power is 20.0 W. This mistake could arise if the energy value (45.0 J) was mistakenly used as the new power value (45.0 W).\n\n#### D: 4V\nThis option is incorrect. This answer may result from mistakenly thinking that the potential difference is directly proportional to the power (V \u221d P), rather than the correct relationship P \u221d V\u00b2. The ratio of the new power to the old power is 20.0 W / 5.0 W = 4. If V were proportional to P, the new voltage would be 4V.

The current I\u2082 must be zero.**\n\nA potentiometer operates on the principle of the null method, which involves balancing an unknown potential difference (p.d.) against a known, adjustable p.d. In this circuit, the external p.d. to be measured, V_PQ, is connected in opposition to the p.d. across the segment of the potentiometer wire XY, which is V_XY.\n\nThe sliding contact Y is moved along the wire XZ until the potential at point Y is exactly equal to the potential at point Q (assuming point X is at the same potential as point P). When these two potentials are equal, there is no potential difference across the branch containing the external circuit and the connection to Y. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), if the potential difference is zero, the current flowing through that branch, I\u2082, must also be zero.\n\nThis \"balance point\" or \"null point\" is the specific condition under which the measurement is taken. At this point, V_PQ = V_XY. Since the wire is uniform, V_XY is proportional to the length L\u2082. The known e.m.f. E is across the total length L\u2081, so V_PQ can be determined using the ratio: V_PQ = (L\u2082 / L\u2081) \u00d7 E. This calculation is only valid when the balance condition (I\u2082 = 0) is met.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The current I\u2081 must be zero.**\n\nThe current I\u2081 flows in the primary circuit, driven by the cell of e.m.f. E. This current is essential for establishing a potential difference across the entire length of the potentiometer wire XZ. Without I\u2081, the potential at every point along the wire would be the same (V = IR = 0), and there would be no potential gradient. A potential gradient is necessary to create the variable p.d. (V_XY) needed to balance the external p.d. Therefore, I\u2081 must be a steady, non-zero current for the potentiometer to function.\n\n**C. The p.d. across YZ must be zero.**\n\nThe total potential difference across the wire XZ is E. This p.d. is distributed along the wire, so E = V_XY + V_YZ. The condition that the p.d. across YZ is zero (V_YZ = 0) would mean that V_XY = E. This only occurs when the balance point Y is at the end of the wire, Z, meaning the balance length L\u2082 is equal to the total length L\u2081. This is a special case that would only happen if the external p.d. being measured was exactly equal to E. A potentiometer is designed to measure a range of potential differences, typically those less than E, for which L\u2082 < L\u2081 and V_YZ is non-zero. Therefore, this is not a general condition for measurement.\n\n**D. The resistance of the external circuit must be zero.**\n\nOne of the primary advantages of a potentiometer is that it measures a potential difference without drawing any current from the circuit being measured (since I\u2082 = 0 at balance). This means the measurement is not affected by the internal resistance of the source of the p.d. or the resistance of the component across which the p.d. exists. Therefore, the external circuit can, and often does, have a non-zero resistance. Requiring the external resistance to be zero would defeat a key purpose of using a potentiometer."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_556.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "36 the diagram shows a circuit.\n\nwhich statement about the circuit is not correct?\n\na_ electromotive force is the energy transferred per unit charge.\n\nb_- energy is transferred from chemical potential energy in the cell to other forms when the\nswitch is closed.\n\nc_ the electromotive force of the cell is greater than the terminal potential difference when the\nswitch is closed.\n\nd when the switch is open, the voltmeter measures the electromotive force of the cell.", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**D. When the switch is open, the voltmeter measures the electromotive force of the cell.**\n\nThis statement is **not correct**. When the switch is open, the electrical circuit is incomplete. Consequently, no current flows from the cell through the main circuit, including the lamp. The voltmeter is connected in parallel across the lamp. According to Ohm's Law, the potential difference (V) across a component is the product of the current (I) flowing through it and its resistance (R), i.e., V = IR. Since the current (I) through the lamp is zero, the potential difference across the lamp is also zero (V = 0 \u00d7 R = 0). Therefore, the voltmeter will read 0 V.\n\nFor a voltmeter to measure the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell, it must be connected directly across the terminals of the cell in a configuration where no current is drawn by the external circuit. In this specific diagram, the placement of the voltmeter across the lamp prevents it from measuring the e.m.f. when the switch is open.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Electromotive force is the energy transferred per unit charge.**\n\nThis statement is correct. By definition, the electromotive force (e.m.f., symbol \u03b5) of a source is the work done by the source in driving a unit charge around a complete circuit. Since work done is a measure of energy transferred, e.m.f. represents the total energy converted from a non-electrical form (e.g., chemical energy in a cell) to electrical energy, per unit of electric charge. The relationship is given by the formula \u03b5 = E/Q, where E is the energy transferred and Q is the charge.\n\n**B. Energy is transferred from chemical potential energy in the cell to other forms when the switch is closed.**\n\nThis statement is correct. A cell functions by converting stored chemical potential energy into electrical potential energy through electrochemical reactions. When the switch is closed, a complete circuit is formed, allowing current to flow. This electrical energy is then transferred to the components of the circuit. In the lamp, the electrical energy is converted into light and thermal energy. A portion of the energy is also dissipated as thermal energy within the cell itself due to its internal resistance. Thus, there is a continuous transfer and transformation of energy originating from the chemical potential energy of the cell.\n\n**C. The electromotive force of the cell is greater than the terminal potential difference when the switch is closed.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Every real cell possesses internal resistance (r). When the switch is closed and a current (I) flows, a potential difference develops across this internal resistance. This internal potential drop, often called \"lost volts,\" is given by Ir. The terminal potential difference (V_T) is the potential difference available to the external circuit. The e.m.f. (\u03b5) is the total potential difference provided by the source. These quantities are related by the equation: V_T = \u03b5 - Ir. Since a current is flowing (I > 0) and the cell has internal resistance (r > 0), the term Ir is positive. Therefore, the terminal potential difference (V_T) will be less than the electromotive force (\u03b5)."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_557.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 a circuit contains a battery of electromotive force e and internal resistance r connected to two\nresistors each of resistance 2.5q.\nthe resistors are connected in parallel as shown.\n|, 8\n' ui '\n| be [lo\n080a 252\n[|\n[|\nthe current in one of the resistors is 0.80a.\nwhich expression, where e is in volts and ris in ohms, gives the internal resistance r?\na e-4.0 b e-40 cc e-2.0 d e-2.0\n1.6 0.80 1.6 0.80", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: C\n\nThe relationship between the electromotive force (e.m.f.) *E* of a source, its internal resistance *r*, the total current *I_total* it supplies, and the terminal potential difference *V* across its terminals is given by the equation:\n*E* = *V* + *I_total* * *r*\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the internal resistance *r*:\n*r* = (*E* - *V*) / *I_total*\n\nTo find the expression for *r*, we must first determine the values of the total current *I_total* and the terminal potential difference *V*.\n\n1.  **Determine the total current (*I_total*):**\n    The two external 2.5 \u03a9 resistors are connected in parallel. In a parallel circuit, the potential difference across each branch is the same. Since the resistors have identical resistance, the total current from the battery will divide equally between them. The problem states that the current in one resistor is 0.80 A. Therefore, the current in the other resistor is also 0.80 A.\n    The total current *I_total* leaving the battery is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches:\n    *I_total* = 0.80 A + 0.80 A = 1.6 A.\n\n2.  **Determine the terminal potential difference (*V*):**\n    The terminal potential difference *V* is the potential difference across the external parallel combination of resistors. Using Ohm's Law (*V* = *IR*) for one of the parallel branches:\n    *V* = (Current in branch) \u00d7 (Resistance of branch)\n    *V* = 0.80 A \u00d7 2.5 \u03a9 = 2.0 V.\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into the equation for *r*:**\n    Now substitute the calculated values of *V* and *I_total* into the rearranged e.m.f. equation:\n    *r* = (*E* - 2.0 V) / 1.6 A\n    This expression matches option C.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A: (E - 4.0) / 1.6**\n    This expression correctly uses the total current (1.6 A) in the denominator. However, it incorrectly uses a value of 4.0 V for the terminal potential difference. This incorrect voltage might be obtained by erroneously multiplying the total current (1.6 A) by the resistance of a single branch (2.5 \u03a9), which gives 4.0 V. The terminal p.d. is the voltage across the parallel combination, which is 2.0 V.\n\n*   **B: (E - 4.0) / 0.80**\n    This expression is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the terminal potential difference is incorrectly stated as 4.0 V, whereas it is 2.0 V. Secondly, the denominator uses the current in a single branch (0.80 A) instead of the total current (1.6 A). The internal resistance *r* experiences the total current flowing from the battery, so the \"lost volts\" (*I_total* * *r*) must be calculated using *I_total*.\n\n*   **D: (E - 2.0) / 0.80**\n    This expression correctly identifies the terminal potential difference as 2.0 V in the numerator. However, the denominator is incorrect. It uses the current flowing through a single parallel branch (0.80 A) instead of the total current (1.6 A) that flows through the internal resistance *r*. The potential difference across the internal resistance is dependent on the total current supplied by the source."}, {"questionName": "A_phy_p1_558.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "9702_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 what is the rest mass of a beta-particle?\na 0\nb 9.11 x 10\u00b0*\"kg\nc 1.66 x 10\u00b0*\u2019kg\nd 1.67 x 10\u00b0*\u2019kg", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "AS", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA beta-particle (\u03b2\u207b) is a high-energy electron that is emitted from the nucleus of an atom during a type of radioactive decay known as beta decay. The rest mass of a particle is its intrinsic mass as measured in a frame of reference where the particle is at rest. The established value for the rest mass of an electron is approximately 9.11 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u00b9 kg. Since a beta-particle is fundamentally an electron, its rest mass is identical to that of an electron.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** A rest mass of 0 is characteristic of massless particles, such as photons. These particles always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. A beta-particle (an electron) has mass and, while it can travel at very high speeds, it can never reach the speed of light. Therefore, its rest mass is non-zero.\n\n**C:** The value 1.66 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg is the approximate value of one unified atomic mass unit (u). This unit is defined as one-twelfth of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 atom and is roughly equivalent to the mass of a proton or a neutron. A beta-particle is an electron, which is a lepton and is significantly less massive than a nucleon (a proton or neutron).\n\n**D:** The value 1.67 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg is the approximate rest mass of a proton (1.672 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg) and a neutron (1.674 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg).

While it is correct that mesons are a type of hadron, baryons are also hadrons, not leptons. Leptons (such as electrons and neutrinos) are fundamental particles that do not interact via the strong nuclear force, whereas baryons are composite particles made of quarks that do experience the strong force.\n\n#### C: leptons, hadrons\nThis option is incorrect because mesons are not a type of lepton. Mesons are composite particles made of a quark and an antiquark, and they interact via the strong nuclear force. In contrast, leptons are fundamental particles that do not feel the strong force. Although it is correct that baryons are a type of hadron, the first part of the statement is incorrect.\n\n#### D: leptons, leptons\nThis option is incorrect because neither mesons nor baryons are leptons.

We can write the nuclear decay equation as:\n\n\u00b2\u00b3\u2081\u2082Mg \u2192 \u00b2\u00b3\u2081\u2081Na + emitted particles\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass Number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons (nucleons) must be the same before and after the decay.\n    *   Initial mass number: 23\n    *   Final mass number: 23\n    *   Therefore, the total mass number of the emitted particles must be 23 - 23 = 0.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge (Atomic Number, Z):** The total charge (number of protons) must be the same before and after the decay.\n    *   Initial atomic number: 12\n    *   Final atomic number: 11\n    *   Therefore, the total charge of the emitted particles must be 12 - 11 = +1.\n\nThe decay must involve the emission of particles that have a combined mass number of 0 and a combined charge of +1. The particle that fits this description is a positron, also known as a beta-plus (\u03b2\u207a) particle (\u2070\u208a\u2081e). This type of decay, where the atomic number decreases by one while the mass number remains unchanged, is called beta-plus decay.\n\nIn beta-plus decay, a proton within the nucleus is converted into a neutron, a positron (\u03b2\u207a), and an electron neutrino (\u03bd). The neutrino is a fundamental particle with no charge and negligible mass, and its emission is required to conserve energy, momentum, and lepton number.\n\nTherefore, the two emitted particles are a \u03b2\u207a particle and a neutrino.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A: \u03b1-particle, antineutrino:** An \u03b1-particle is a helium nucleus (\u2074\u2082He). Its emission would decrease the mass number by 4 (from 23 to 19) and the atomic number by 2 (from 12 to 10). This does not match the resulting sodium-23 nucleus.\n\n*   **B: \u03b2\u207a particle, antineutrino:** While the emission of a \u03b2\u207a particle is correct, beta-plus decay is always accompanied by the emission of a neutrino (\u03bd), not an antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304). An antineutrino is emitted during beta-minus decay. This choice violates the conservation of lepton number.\n\n*   **C: \u03b2\u207b particle, neutrino:** A \u03b2\u207b particle is an electron (\u2070\u208b\u2081e).
