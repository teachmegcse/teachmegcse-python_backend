This sequence forms the genetic code, which determines the characteristics of an organism by directing the synthesis of specific proteins. By comparing the DNA base sequences of different organisms, scientists can quantify their genetic similarity. Organisms with more similar DNA sequences are considered to be more closely related, meaning they share a more recent common ancestor. This molecular evidence provides a more precise and objective basis for understanding evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) than relying solely on observable physical traits.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThe number of strands of messenger RNA (mRNA) is not a feature used for classification. In all organisms, mRNA is a single-stranded molecule that carries genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes for protein synthesis. As this is a universal characteristic, it does not provide a basis for distinguishing between different species.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThe overall shape of DNA molecules is not used as a primary means of classification. The fundamental structure of DNA in all cellular life is a double helix. While there are some higher-level structural differences, such as the linear chromosomes found in eukaryotes versus the circular chromosome in prokaryotes, the basic double-helical shape is a universal feature. It does not offer the detailed, species-specific information required for modern classification systems.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThe types of bases in DNA are not used for classification because all known organisms use the same four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). Since these four bases are universal, their presence is not a distinguishing feature. It is the specific order, or sequence, in which these bases are arranged along the DNA strand that creates the genetic variation necessary to differentiate between and classify organisms."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_2.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "2 how many jointed legs does an insect have?\na two pairs\nb three pairs\nc four pairs\nd_ more than six pairs", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nInsects are a class of invertebrates within the phylum Arthropoda. A defining characteristic of all insects is the presence of a three-part body (head, thorax, and abdomen) and **three pairs of jointed legs**. These six legs are always attached to the thorax, the middle section of the body. This feature is consistent across the vast diversity of insect species and is a key identifier for the class Insecta.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** Two pairs of legs (a total of four legs) is not a standard characteristic for any major class within the phylum Arthropoda. The defining plan for an insect body includes three pairs of legs, not two.\n\n**C:** The presence of four pairs of jointed legs (a total of eight legs) is the primary characteristic of the class Arachnida, not Insecta. Arachnids, which include spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites, are distinguished from insects by having eight legs and typically a two-part body (cephalothorax and abdomen).\n\n**D:** Having more than six pairs of legs is characteristic of other classes within the phylum Arthropoda, such as Myriapoda (centipedes and millipedes) and many Crustacea (crabs, lobsters, and woodlice).

Its presence gives the plant cell a fixed, regular shape and provides structural support. This is a key feature distinguishing plant cells from animal cells, which lack a cell wall.\n*   **Structure S** is a **chloroplast**, a small, ovoid organelle containing the green pigment chlorophyll.

While both of these are features of a typical plant cell, this combination is not the most definitive choice. Some protists, such as algae, can also possess both chloroplasts and vacuoles.\n\n**B: P and S**\nBoth P and S are labels pointing to chloroplasts. This option identifies the same feature twice. To confidently identify the cell type, it is necessary to use at least two different characteristic structures. Therefore, this option is insufficient as it only provides one piece of evidence.\n\n**C: Q and R**\nStructure Q is the cell wall, and structure R is the large central vacuole. Although both are found in plant cells, this combination is less specific than D. Fungal cells also possess a cell wall (made of chitin) and vacuoles.

To use this formula, both the image size and the actual size must be in the same units.\n\n1.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   Image size (measured from the diagram) = 49 mm\n    *   Actual size = 7.0 micrometres (\u00b5m)\n\n2.  **Convert units:** It is necessary to convert one of the measurements so that both are in the same unit. It is often simplest to convert the larger unit (mm) to the smaller unit (\u00b5m).\n    *   There are 1000 micrometres (\u00b5m) in 1 millimetre (mm).\n    *   Therefore, the image size in micrometres is: 49 mm \u00d7 1000 \u00b5m/mm = 49,000 \u00b5m.\n\n3.  **Calculate the magnification:**\n    *   Magnification = 49,000 \u00b5m / 7.0 \u00b5m\n    *   Magnification = 7000\n\nThe magnification of the cell is therefore x7000.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) x70**\nThis answer is incorrect due to a significant error in unit conversion. This result would be obtained if it was mistakenly assumed that 1 mm is equal to 10 \u00b5m, leading to a calculation of (49 \u00d7 10) \u00b5m / 7.0 \u00b5m = 490 / 7.0 = 70. The correct conversion factor is 1000 \u00b5m per mm.\n\n**B) x700**\nThis answer is incorrect and results from a common error in unit conversion. If it was incorrectly assumed that 1 mm is equal to 100 \u00b5m (instead of the correct 1000 \u00b5m), the calculation would be (49 \u00d7 100) \u00b5m / 7.0 \u00b5m = 4900 / 7.0 = 700.

This movement occurs from a region of higher water potential (a more dilute solution) to a region of lower water potential (a more concentrated solution). By definition, water is the molecule whose movement is characterized as osmosis. The partially permeable membrane allows the passage of small solvent molecules like water while restricting the movement of larger solute molecules.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: carbon dioxide**\nCarbon dioxide is a small molecule that can cross a partially permeable membrane. However, its movement is driven by its concentration gradient, a process known as simple diffusion, not osmosis. Osmosis specifically refers to the movement of water molecules in response to a water potential gradient, not the movement of dissolved gases like carbon dioxide.\n\n**B: oxygen**\nLike carbon dioxide, oxygen is a small molecule that moves across partially permeable membranes via simple diffusion, down its own concentration gradient. This is a vital process for cellular respiration. However, this movement is not osmosis, which is a term reserved exclusively for the net movement of water.\n\n**C: urea**\nUrea is a solute. In a solution, solutes are the substances that lower the water potential. It is the difference in the concentration of solutes like urea on either side of a membrane that creates the water potential gradient, causing water to move via osmosis. While urea itself may diffuse across the membrane, this movement is not osmosis. Osmosis describes the movement of the solvent (water), not the solute."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_6.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "6 the graph shows the rate of uptake of magnesium ions by two similar plants, x and y.\nthe roots of each plant were placed in a range of solutions. each solution contained a different\nconcentration of magnesium ions. all other conditions were kept constant.\n\nplant x\nrate of uptake of\nmagnesium ions\nplant y\nconcentration of magnesium\nions in external solution\nwhat is a possible explanation for the difference in the results for the two plants?\na_ plant y has fewer protein carriers for magnesium ions in its cell membranes.\nb_ plant y has a higher rate of respiration.\nc_ plant y has more root hair cells.\nd_ the root hair cells in plant y have a lower water potential.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation:\n\n**A. Plant Y has fewer protein carriers for magnesium ions in its cell membranes.**\n\nThe uptake of mineral ions, such as magnesium, from the soil into root hair cells occurs primarily through active transport. This process requires specific protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane to bind to the ions and move them into the cell, against a concentration gradient. The rate of active transport is limited by the number of available protein carriers. The graph shows that at higher external concentrations of magnesium ions, the rate of uptake for both plants plateaus. This plateau represents the maximum rate of transport (Vmax), which is reached when all available protein carriers are saturated and working at their maximum capacity. Since Plant Y has a lower plateau than Plant X, it indicates that its maximum rate of uptake is lower. This is best explained by Plant Y having fewer protein carriers for magnesium ions in its root cell membranes, thus limiting the overall speed at which it can absorb these ions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Plant Y has a higher rate of respiration.**\n\nActive transport is an energy-dependent process that relies on ATP (adenosine triphosphate) produced during cellular respiration. A higher rate of respiration would lead to a greater supply of ATP. This increased energy availability would fuel a *faster* rate of active transport, resulting in a *higher* rate of magnesium ion uptake, not a lower one. Therefore, if Plant Y had a higher rate of respiration, its curve on the graph would be above that of Plant X, which contradicts the data shown.\n\n**C. Plant Y has more root hair cells.**\n\nRoot hair cells are specialized epidermal cells that significantly increase the surface area of the root system for the absorption of water and mineral ions. Having more root hair cells would provide a larger surface area for active transport to occur. A larger surface area would lead to a greater overall rate of ion uptake for the plant. Consequently, if Plant Y had more root hair cells, its rate of uptake would be higher than Plant X's, which is the opposite of what the graph illustrates.\n\n**D. The root hair cells in plant Y have a lower water potential.**\n\nWater potential is the measure of the potential energy of water and governs the movement of water by osmosis. While the active transport of ions into the root cells does lower their water potential (making it more negative) and thus promotes water uptake, the water potential itself does not determine the rate of *ion uptake*. The rate of ion uptake is determined by the mechanisms of active transport, namely the availability of protein carriers and ATP. Therefore, the water potential of the root hair cells is not the direct explanation for the difference in the rate of magnesium ion absorption between the two plants."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_7.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "7 which substance is used to test a food for vitamin c?\na benedict\u2019s solution\nb- dcpip\nc_ ethanol\nd iodine solution", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nDCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) is a redox indicator used to test for the presence of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In its oxidised state, DCPIP solution is blue. Vitamin C is a strong reducing agent. When a solution containing vitamin C is added to DCPIP, the vitamin C donates electrons to the DCPIP, reducing it. The reduced form of DCPIP is colourless. Therefore, a positive test for vitamin C is the decolourisation of the blue DCPIP solution. This test can also be used quantitatively; the volume of a sample required to decolourise a standard volume of DCPIP is inversely proportional to the concentration of vitamin C in the sample.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Benedict's solution** is used to test for the presence of reducing sugars, such as glucose and maltose. The test involves adding Benedict's solution to a sample and heating it in a water bath. If reducing sugars are present, the blue solution changes colour, forming a green, yellow, orange, or brick-red precipitate, depending on the concentration of the sugar.\n\n**C. ethanol** is used as a solvent in the emulsion test for lipids (fats and oils). The food sample is shaken with ethanol to dissolve any lipids present. This solution is then poured into water. Since lipids are insoluble in water, they form small droplets suspended in the water, creating a cloudy white emulsion, which indicates a positive result.\n\n**D. iodine solution** is used to test for the presence of starch. When a few drops of yellowish-brown iodine solution are added to a sample containing starch, the iodine molecules interact with the starch molecules to form a distinctive blue-black complex. This colour change indicates a positive test for starch."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_8.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "8 in dna, what is the correct base pairing?\na twithc b twitht c twithg d twitha", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. T with A\n\nIn the structure of a DNA molecule, base pairing is highly specific according to the principle of complementary base pairing. The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). Adenine, a purine, always pairs with Thymine, a pyrimidine. This A-T pair is stabilised by two hydrogen bonds. This specific pairing is essential for maintaining the uniform, stable structure of the DNA double helix.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A. T with C\n\nThis pairing is incorrect. According to the rules of complementary base pairing, Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A), and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G). Both Thymine and Cytosine are pyrimidines (single-ring bases). The DNA structure requires a purine (double-ring base) to pair with a pyrimidine to maintain a constant width. A T-C pairing would disrupt this structure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B. T with T\n\nThis pairing is incorrect. A nitrogenous base does not pair with an identical base in the DNA double helix. Base pairing must occur between a purine and a pyrimidine. Since Thymine (T) is a pyrimidine, pairing it with another pyrimidine would make the DNA strand too narrow at that point, destabilising the overall structure of the molecule.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C. T with G\n\nThis pairing is incorrect. While it involves a pyrimidine (Thymine) and a purine (Guanine), their molecular structures are not complementary. The specific arrangement of atoms and functional groups on Thymine and Guanine prevents them from forming stable hydrogen bonds with each other. The correct complementary pairings are T with A (forming two hydrogen bonds) and G with C (forming three hydrogen bonds)."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_9.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "9 what remains at the end of an enzyme-controlled reaction?\na enzymes and products\nb enzymes and substrates\nc enzymes only\nd products only", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: A**\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts, which means they increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being chemically changed or consumed in the process. In an enzyme-controlled reaction, the enzyme binds to a specific molecule called the substrate. This forms an enzyme-substrate complex where the substrate is converted into one or more products. Once the reaction is complete, the products are released from the enzyme's active site. The enzyme is then free and unchanged, ready to catalyse another reaction. Therefore, at the end of the reaction, when all the substrate has been converted, the final mixture contains the newly formed products and the original, unchanged enzyme molecules.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **B) enzymes and substrates:** This describes the components at the *beginning* of an enzyme-controlled reaction, not the end. Substrates are the reactant molecules that are converted into products during the reaction. By the end of the reaction, it is assumed that all or most of the substrate has been used up and transformed into products.\n\n*   **C) enzymes only:** This is incorrect because it ignores the products of the reaction. While it is true that enzymes remain unchanged at the end of the reaction, the entire purpose of the reaction is to convert substrates into products. These products are a key component of the final reaction mixture.\n\n*   **D) products only:** This is incorrect because it ignores the presence of the enzyme. Since enzymes are catalysts, they are not consumed or used up during the reaction. After releasing the product, the enzyme molecule remains in the solution, structurally intact and available to catalyze further reactions if more substrate were added. Therefore, the enzyme is still present at the end of the reaction."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_10.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "10 which feature explains the specificity of an enzyme?\na complementary shape of active site and substrate\nb_ denaturation at certain ph values\nc_ temperature change leading to change in enzyme activity\nd varying frequency of effective collisions between enzyme and substrate", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe specificity of an enzyme is determined by the unique, three-dimensional shape of its active site. This active site has a precise shape and chemical environment that is complementary to a specific molecule, known as the substrate. This relationship is often described by the lock-and-key model, where the substrate (the key) fits perfectly into the active site (the lock). Because of this structural complementarity, only the correct substrate can bind effectively to the active site, allowing the enzyme to catalyse a specific chemical reaction. Other molecules with different shapes will not fit, which is why enzymes are highly specific in their action.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: denaturation at certain pH values**\nDenaturation is the process where an enzyme loses its specific three-dimensional shape, including the shape of its active site, due to extreme conditions such as non-optimal pH. While denaturation explains why an enzyme *loses* its activity and specificity, it does not explain how the enzyme possesses that specificity in the first place. Specificity is an inherent property of the enzyme's correct, functional structure, whereas denaturation is the loss of that structure and function.\n\n**C: temperature change leading to change in enzyme activity**\nTemperature affects the rate of enzyme activity by altering the kinetic energy of both the enzyme and substrate molecules. Increasing temperature generally increases the rate of reaction up to an optimal point. However, this change in activity rate does not explain the enzyme's specificity. Specificity is about *which* substrate an enzyme binds to, a property determined by the shape of the active site, not the speed at which the reaction occurs. An enzyme remains specific to its substrate across a range of temperatures (until it denatures).\n\n**D: varying frequency of effective collisions between enzyme and substrate**\nThe frequency of effective collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules determines the rate of the reaction. Factors like temperature and concentration influence this frequency. A higher frequency leads to a faster reaction rate. However, this concept explains the kinetics or speed of the reaction, not the enzyme's specificity. An enzyme will not catalyse a reaction with a non-specific substrate, no matter how frequently they collide, because the non-specific substrate cannot bind correctly to the active site. Therefore, collision frequency explains *how often* a specific reaction occurs, not *why* only that specific reaction can occur."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_11.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "11 a plant is placed in the dark until all its stored starch is used up. the plant is placed in light with\nblack paper over part of one green leaf.\nblack paper over\nboth sides of the leaf\nhole cut in the paper\nafter eight hours, the leaf is tested for starch.\nwhich diagram shows the appearance of the leaf after this test?\na b\nan yee key\na = starch\npresent\n& o [| = starch not\n- l\u2014\u2014 => _", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis experiment investigates the necessity of light for photosynthesis.

The absorption of different digested nutrients occurs in these specific structures.\n\n**Structure P (Blood Capillaries):** These vessels absorb the water-soluble products of carbohydrate and protein digestion. Carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides, such as glucose, and proteins are broken down into amino acids. These small, soluble molecules are absorbed from the small intestine into the blood capillaries, primarily through diffusion and active transport.\n\n**Structure Q (Lacteal):** This vessel is responsible for absorbing the products of fat (lipid) digestion. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. These molecules diffuse into the epithelial cells of the villus, where they are reassembled into triglycerides and then enter the lacteal.\n\nTherefore, the blood capillary (P) absorbs glucose, and the lacteal (Q) absorbs fatty acids.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: P - amino acids; Q - glucose**\nThis option is incorrect. While the blood capillary (P) does absorb amino acids, the lacteal (Q) does not absorb glucose. Glucose is a water-soluble monosaccharide that is absorbed into the blood capillaries (P), not the lymphatic system.\n\n**B: P - fatty acids; Q - maltose**\nThis option is incorrect. Fatty acids are absorbed by the lacteal (Q), not the blood capillary (P). Additionally, maltose is a disaccharide and is not typically absorbed directly; it is first broken down into glucose by the enzyme maltase before being absorbed into the blood capillaries (P).\n\n**D: P - maltose; Q - amino acids**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, maltose is a disaccharide that must be hydrolysed into glucose before it can be absorbed by the blood capillary (P). Secondly, amino acids are absorbed into the blood capillaries (P), not the lacteal (Q)."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_15.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "15 the arrows show the movement of substances from the soil into a root hair cell.\n\u2014\u2014 |\nwhich substances move from the soil into the root hair cell?\na_ carbon dioxide and oxygen\nb_ glucose and water\nc_ mineral ions and glucose\nd_ water and mineral ions", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe primary function of root hair cells is to absorb essential substances from the soil for the plant. Water is absorbed from the soil into the root hair cell by osmosis. This occurs because the concentration of solutes inside the cell's vacuole is higher than in the soil water, creating a lower water potential inside the cell. Water then moves down this water potential gradient across the partially permeable cell membrane. Mineral ions (such as nitrates, phosphates, and potassium) are also absorbed from the soil. As the concentration of these ions is often higher inside the root cells than in the soil, they are taken up by active transport, a process that requires energy from respiration to move substances against their concentration gradient.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: carbon dioxide and oxygen**\nCarbon dioxide is a reactant for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their own food. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, which are located in parts of the plant exposed to light, primarily the leaves. Roots are underground and do not photosynthesise, so they do not absorb carbon dioxide from the soil. While root cells do absorb oxygen from air spaces in the soil for aerobic respiration, the inclusion of carbon dioxide makes this option incorrect.\n\n**B: glucose and water**\nGlucose is a simple sugar produced during photosynthesis in the leaves. It serves as the primary energy source for all living cells in the plant, including root cells. Glucose is transported from the leaves to the roots via the phloem tissue; it is not absorbed from the soil. Although water is correctly identified as being absorbed from the soil, glucose is not.\n\n**C: mineral ions and glucose**\nGlucose is produced by the plant during photosynthesis in the leaves and transported to the roots for energy; it is not taken in from the soil. While mineral ions are absorbed from the soil by the roots, the inclusion of glucose in this option makes it incorrect."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_16.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "16 by which process does water escape from stomata in the leaves?\na active transport\nb diffusion\nc_ evaporation\nd_ osmosis", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B. diffusion\n\nThe process by which water vapour escapes from the stomata in the leaves is diffusion. Inside the leaf, the air spaces surrounding the mesophyll cells are saturated with water vapour, creating a high concentration of water molecules. The air outside the leaf typically has a lower concentration of water vapour. This difference establishes a concentration gradient. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Consequently, water vapour molecules move down this concentration gradient, from the air spaces inside the leaf, out through the stomatal pores, and into the surrounding atmosphere. This entire process of water loss from the leaves is known as transpiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. active transport**\nActive transport is the movement of substances across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, a process that requires energy in the form of ATP. The escape of water vapour from the leaves is a passive process, driven by a concentration gradient, and does not require metabolic energy from the plant. Therefore, active transport is not involved.\n\n**C. evaporation**\nEvaporation is the process where a liquid changes into a gas. While evaporation is a crucial step in transpiration, it occurs specifically when liquid water on the surface of the mesophyll cells turns into water vapour within the air spaces inside the leaf. The question asks about the process by which this water (now in a gaseous state) *escapes* from the stomata. This movement of gas particles out of the leaf is driven by a concentration gradient and is correctly termed diffusion, not evaporation.\n\n**D. osmosis**\nOsmosis is the specific type of diffusion involving the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. While osmosis is responsible for the movement of water between cells within the plant (e.g., from the xylem to the mesophyll cells), the escape of water vapour through the stomata into the air does not involve a partially permeable membrane. The stomata are simply pores, and the movement is of water vapour in the air, not liquid water across a membrane."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_17.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "17 which row about the circulatory system is correct?\n[| partiat pumps ood [parti vanes |\na heart heart and veins\nb heart and blood vessels all blood vessels\ncc capillaries heart\nd heart capillaries and arteries", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nThe heart is the primary organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the circulatory system. Its muscular walls contract rhythmically (systole) to generate the high pressure needed to propel blood into the arteries. The heart contains four main valves (the tricuspid, bicuspid/mitral, aortic, and pulmonary valves) which ensure that blood flows in only one direction through its chambers. Veins, which carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart under much lower pressure, also contain valves. These valves are particularly important in the limbs, where they prevent the backflow of blood due to gravity.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nWhile the heart pumps blood, blood vessels do not. The muscular walls of arteries help to maintain blood pressure, but they do not actively pump blood. Furthermore, not all blood vessels contain valves. Arteries, which carry high-pressure blood away from the heart, do not have valves. Capillaries, the sites of substance exchange, also lack valves. Only veins contain valves to prevent the backflow of low-pressure blood.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nCapillaries are the smallest blood vessels and are adapted for the exchange of substances between the blood and body tissues. Their walls are only one cell thick, and they lack muscle tissue, meaning they cannot contract to pump blood. While the heart does contain valves, the first part of this statement is incorrect, making the entire row invalid.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nWhile it is correct that the heart pumps blood, the statement that capillaries and arteries have valves is incorrect. Arteries carry blood away from the heart under high pressure, so backflow is not an issue, and they do not have valves (with the exception of the semilunar valves located at the exit of the heart).

The left ventricle pumps blood to the entire body (systemic circulation) and therefore must generate the highest pressure. This corresponds to the dotted line, which peaks at approximately 15 kPa. The right ventricle pumps blood only to the lungs (pulmonary circulation), a much shorter circuit with lower resistance, and thus generates a lower pressure. This corresponds to the solid line, which peaks at around 3 kPa.\n\nThe question requires identifying the pressure in the right ventricle at the exact moment the left ventricle reaches its maximum pressure.\n1.  First, locate the peak of the left ventricle's pressure curve (the dotted line). This peak occurs at approximately 0.35 seconds.\n2.  Next, find the pressure of the right ventricle (the solid line) at this same time point (0.35 s).\n3.  Following the vertical line from 0.35 s on the time axis up to the solid curve, and then across to the pressure axis, the value is 3.0 kPa. This is because both ventricles contract at the same time (ventricular systole), but the left ventricle generates a much greater force and pressure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 0.4 kPa**\nThis pressure value is incorrect. A pressure of 0.4 kPa in the right ventricle occurs during ventricular diastole (the relaxation phase), for instance, around 0.65 seconds. However, the question asks for the pressure at the time of maximum left ventricular pressure, which is during peak ventricular systole (the contraction phase). During this phase, the right ventricle is also actively contracting and generating a much higher pressure than 0.4 kPa.\n\n**B: 2.0 kPa**\nThis pressure value is incorrect. The right ventricle has a pressure of 2.0 kPa at two points in the cycle: during its pressure build-up (at approximately 0.18 s) and as its pressure falls after the peak (at approximately 0.5 s). Neither of these time points corresponds to the moment of maximum pressure in the left ventricle, which occurs at about 0.35 seconds.\n\n**D: 15.0 kPa**\nThis value represents the maximum pressure generated by the left ventricle, not the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps blood to the low-pressure pulmonary circuit (the lungs), while the left ventricle pumps blood to the high-pressure systemic circuit (the rest of the body). Consequently, the pressure generated by the right ventricle is significantly lower than that of the left ventricle. The question asks for the pressure in the right ventricle at the time of the left ventricle's peak pressure."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_19.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "19 the sequence of amino acids in antibodies enables them to complete which function?\na bind to a specific antigen\nb _ bind to all pathogens\nc perform phagocytosis\nd_ confer passive immunity for all diseases", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nAntibodies are proteins, and the sequence of their amino acids determines their three-dimensional structure. A critical part of the antibody's structure is the variable region, which contains the antigen-binding site. The specific sequence of amino acids in this region creates a unique shape that is precisely complementary to the shape of a specific antigen, much like a lock and key. This specificity is crucial for the adaptive immune system, as it allows antibodies to recognise and target a particular pathogen or foreign substance without affecting the body's own cells or other non-threatening molecules.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: bind to all pathogens**\nThis is incorrect because the function of antibodies is highly specific. The unique amino acid sequence in the variable region of an antibody creates a binding site for only one type of antigen. Different pathogens possess different antigens on their surfaces. Therefore, a single type of antibody cannot bind to all pathogens. The immune system overcomes this by producing a vast diversity of antibodies, each tailored to a specific pathogen.\n\n**C: perform phagocytosis**\nThis is incorrect. Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing and digesting pathogens or cellular debris. This function is carried out by specialised cells called phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Antibodies are proteins, not cells, and therefore lack the cellular machinery to perform phagocytosis. While antibodies can aid phagocytosis by binding to pathogens and marking them for destruction (a process called opsonization), they do not carry out the engulfing process themselves.\n\n**D: confer passive immunity for all diseases**\nThis statement is incorrect. While antibodies are responsible for conferring passive immunity (the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another), this immunity is specific, not general. The transferred antibodies will only provide protection against the specific diseases for which they were produced. For example, antibodies against the measles virus will not provide immunity to the influenza virus.

This corresponds to the change **X** (from relaxed to contracted). This contraction increases the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity.\n2.  **External Intercostal Muscles:** These muscles also change from a relaxed to a contracted state, corresponding to change **Y**. Their contraction pulls the rib cage upwards and outwards, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity from front to back and side to side.\n3.  **Internal Intercostal Muscles:** These muscles work antagonistically to the external intercostal muscles. For the external intercostals to contract and lift the rib cage, the internal intercostals must relax. This corresponds to change **R** (from contracted to relaxed), although in quiet breathing they simply remain relaxed.\n\nThe combined effect of these muscle actions (X and Y) increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, which in turn lowers the pressure within the lungs relative to the atmosphere, causing air to flow in.

P (diaphragm relaxing) and Q (external intercostal muscles relaxing) are the key events that cause expiration (exhalation), not inspiration. Z (internal intercostal muscles contracting) is an action that occurs during forced expiration to actively decrease the thoracic volume. This combination of changes describes expiration.\n\n**B: X, Q and R**\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the external intercostal muscles relax (Q). For inspiration to occur, the external intercostal muscles must contract (Y) to lift the rib cage up and out.

The apparatus is designed to measure the change in gas volume. To measure oxygen consumption accurately, the carbon dioxide produced must be removed. Therefore, the chemical (typically soda lime or potassium hydroxide) is present to absorb the carbon dioxide.\n3.  **Direction of movement of the coloured liquid:** As the seeds consume oxygen and the chemical absorbs the carbon dioxide they produce, there is a net decrease in the volume of gas inside the sealed test tube.

The products of this reaction are ethanol (an alcohol) and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is a gas that forms bubbles, which become trapped in the dough's elastic gluten network. These trapped gas bubbles cause the dough to expand and rise, resulting in the light, airy texture characteristic of leavened bread.

This response is crucial for a plant's survival, ensuring roots grow down into the soil and shoots grow up towards potential light sources.\n\nThe root of the seedling exhibits **positive gravitropism**. This means it grows in the direction of the gravitational pull (downwards). Gravity causes a plant hormone called auxin to accumulate on the lower side of the root. In roots, high concentrations of auxin inhibit cell elongation. Consequently, the cells on the upper side of the root elongate more rapidly than the cells on the lower side, causing the root to bend and grow downwards.\n\nThe shoot of the seedling exhibits **negative gravitropism**, meaning it grows in the opposite direction to the gravitational pull (upwards). Similar to the root, gravity causes auxin to accumulate on the lower side of the shoot. However, in shoots, high concentrations of auxin stimulate cell elongation. This causes the cells on the lower side to elongate faster than those on the upper side, resulting in the shoot bending and growing upwards.\n\nSince the seedling is in a dark box, light is not a factor. Therefore, gravity is the sole directional stimulus guiding the growth of both the root and the shoot.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: gravitropism (root), phototropism (shoot)**\nThis option incorrectly identifies the response of the shoot. Phototropism is the directional growth of a plant in response to a light stimulus. As the seedling is in a completely dark box, there is no light stimulus present. Therefore, the shoot cannot be exhibiting phototropism. Its upward growth is a result of negative gravitropism.\n\n**C: phototropism (root), gravitropism (shoot)**\nThis option incorrectly identifies the response of the root.

This is a strain of bacteria that has developed resistance to several common antibiotics, including methicillin and other related antibiotics from the beta-lactam class. This resistance is a result of natural selection, where bacteria with genetic mutations that allow them to survive antibiotic treatment reproduce and pass on their resistant genes. Because standard antibiotics are ineffective against MRSA, treating these infections is challenging, often requiring the use of alternative, more powerful, or last-resort antibiotics, which may have greater side effects and are not always successful.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. MRSA is a bacterium.**\nWhile it is true that MRSA (*Staphylococcus aureus*) is a type of bacterium, this fact alone does not explain why it is difficult to treat. Many different types of bacterial infections can be treated effectively and easily with common antibiotics. The difficulty in treating a specific bacterial infection like MRSA arises from its acquired resistance to these drugs, not simply from its classification as a bacterium.\n\n**B. MRSA is a virus.**\nThis statement is incorrect. MRSA is a bacterium, which is a single-celled prokaryotic organism. Viruses are non-cellular infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. Bacterial and viral infections are fundamentally different and are treated with different types of medications (antibiotics for bacteria, antivirals for viruses).\n\n**D. MRSA is resistant to some antibodies.**\nThis statement confuses antibiotics with antibodies. Antibiotics are antimicrobial drugs used to treat bacterial infections. Antibodies are proteins produced by an organism's immune system to identify and neutralise pathogens like bacteria and viruses. While bacteria can evolve mechanisms to evade the host's immune response (which involves antibodies), the term 'resistance' in the context of MRSA refers specifically to its ability to withstand treatment with antibiotic medications, which is the primary reason it is difficult to cure with medicine."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_28.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "28 what is the order of flower parts through which the pollen tube must grow to reach the egg cell\nnucleus during fertilisation?\na stigma \u2014> style > ovule > ovary\nb stigma \u2014 style > ovary > ovule\nc style > stigma \u2014 ovule > ovary\nd style > stigma \u2014 ovary > ovule", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nFertilisation in a flowering plant begins after pollination, when a pollen grain lands on the stigma.

As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, it reads each codon and facilitates the addition of the corresponding amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. Therefore, the specific order of codons in the mRNA directly determines the primary structure, or the sequence of amino acids, of the resulting protein.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The gene coding for the protein moves from nucleus to cytoplasm.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A gene is a segment of DNA, which is a very large and important molecule that is housed and protected within the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. The DNA itself does not leave the nucleus. Instead, the genetic information from the gene is copied onto a smaller, mobile molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) during a process called transcription.

Genetic variation is introduced through two main processes: crossing over, where sections of DNA are exchanged between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I, and independent assortment, where homologous chromosomes are randomly segregated into daughter cells during Metaphase I and Anaphase I. This results in four genetically unique haploid cells.\n2.  **It produces cells that are diploid:** This statement is incorrect. Meiosis is a form of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half. It starts with one diploid (2n) parent cell and produces four haploid (n) daughter cells. Mitosis, not meiosis, produces diploid cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.\n3.  **It produces cells that are haploid:** This statement is correct. The purpose of meiosis in humans is to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells), which must be haploid (n).

The allele for red-green colour blindness is recessive, represented here as 'r'. For a male to be colour-blind, his single X chromosome must carry this recessive allele (X\u02b3).

The primary function of a waxy cuticle on a leaf is to prevent water loss through evaporation from the leaf surface. Since hydrophytes are surrounded by water, there is no risk of dehydration, and therefore, no need for a water-conserving feature like a thick waxy cuticle. In fact, many submerged hydrophytes absorb water and dissolved mineral salts directly through their entire surface, and a cuticle would hinder this process. Consequently, they typically have a very thin cuticle or no cuticle at all.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Leaves are curled with stomata on the inside.**\nThis is an adaptation found in xerophytes, which are plants adapted to arid (dry) conditions. Curling the leaves traps a layer of still, humid air around the stomata. This reduces the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside air, thereby decreasing the rate of transpiration (water loss). Hydrophytes have no need to conserve water in this way.\n\n**B. Leaves are reduced to spines.**\nThis is a xerophytic adaptation, characteristic of plants like cacti. Reducing leaves to spines drastically minimises the surface area available for transpiration, which is crucial for survival in a dry habitat. Hydrophytes, in contrast, often have large leaves to maximise sunlight absorption for photosynthesis or are finely divided to increase surface area for absorption of nutrients from the water.\n\n**C. Stomata are sunk in pits in the epidermis.**\nThis is another adaptation of xerophytes. Placing stomata in pits or depressions in the leaf surface helps to trap moist air, similar to the effect of curling leaves. This trapped humid air reduces the water potential gradient between the leaf and the atmosphere, slowing the rate of water loss. Hydrophytes do not need to reduce water loss and, for floating leaves, have stomata on the upper epidermis exposed directly to the air for efficient gas exchange."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_34.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "34 which statements are correct during both natural selection and artificial selection?\n1 only certain individuals reproduce.\n2 alleles are passed on to the offspring.\n3 organisms do not compete with each other for survival.\na 1and2 b 1and3 c 2only d 2and3", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: \"Only certain individuals reproduce.\"** This statement is correct for both processes. In natural selection, individuals with phenotypes (and underlying alleles) best suited to their environment have a higher chance of surviving, reproducing, and passing on their genes. This is often referred to as 'survival of the fittest'. In artificial selection, humans act as the selective pressure, intentionally choosing only those individuals with desirable traits to be the parents of the next generation. In both cases, reproduction is not random; it is selective.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"Alleles are passed on to the offspring.\"** This statement is also correct for both processes. Both natural and artificial selection depend on the principles of heredity.

This essential process is known as **nitrogen fixation**. During nitrogen fixation, inert nitrogen gas (N\u2082) from the atmosphere is converted into more reactive nitrogen compounds, such as ammonia (NH\u2083) or nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b), which plants can then absorb and assimilate to build proteins and other vital molecules. This conversion is primarily carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, some of which live freely in the soil, while others live in symbiotic relationships in the root nodules of leguminous plants.\n\nProcess 2 illustrates the conversion of nitrates in the soil back into gaseous nitrogen, which returns to the atmosphere. This process is called **denitrification**. It is performed by denitrifying bacteria under anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions in the soil.

Untreated sewage is rich in organic matter and nutrients. This provides an abundant food source for decomposer bacteria, causing their population to multiply rapidly, hence their numbers **increase**. These bacteria are aerobic, meaning they use dissolved oxygen from the water for respiration as they break down the organic waste. The massive increase in the bacterial population leads to a high rate of oxygen consumption, causing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water to **decrease** significantly.

Consequently, while the oxygen concentration would indeed decrease, the fish population would also decrease due to the lack of oxygen, not increase as suggested.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect. The presence of organic matter from sewage would lead to an **increase** in the population of decomposer bacteria, not a decrease.

The mesh is the grid of holes in a fishing net. By setting a legal minimum size for these holes, it is ensured that smaller, younger fish can swim through the net and escape. Only fish that are larger than the mesh size will be trapped and caught. This method selectively targets larger, more mature fish, while allowing juvenile fish to survive, grow, and reproduce, which is essential for maintaining the long-term health and sustainability of the fish stock.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. having closed seasons**\nThis conservation method involves prohibiting fishing during specific times of the year, typically the breeding or spawning season for a particular species. The goal is to protect fish when they are reproducing, allowing for the successful production of the next generation. While this is a crucial conservation strategy, it controls *when* fishing can occur, not the size of the fish that are caught. During the open season, nets or lines that do not discriminate by size can still catch both large and small fish.\n\n**B. having protected areas**\nThis method involves establishing marine reserves or no-take zones where all fishing activities are banned. These protected areas act as sanctuaries, allowing fish populations within them to grow and reproduce without any fishing pressure. This helps to increase the overall fish biomass and can lead to a \"spillover\" effect, where fish from the protected area move into surrounding, fishable waters. However, this method controls *where* fishing can occur, not the size of the fish caught in the areas outside the reserve.\n\n**D. setting legal fishing quotas**\nThis conservation method involves setting a limit on the total quantity (either by weight or number) of a specific fish species that can be caught in a particular area over a set period. The purpose of a quota is to prevent over-exploitation of the entire fish stock by controlling the overall fishing mortality. While this limits the *amount* of fish harvested, it does not regulate the *size* of the individual fish that make up the catch.

It is composed of phospholipids and proteins and is vital for cellular transport and communication, but it does not contain the genetic information (DNA) that is altered during genetic engineering.\n\n**B. cell wall**\nThe cell wall is a rigid structural layer outside the cell membrane that provides support and protection to the bacterial cell, preventing it from bursting due to osmotic pressure. It is made of peptidoglycan and is not a genetic component; thus, it is not the part of the bacterium that is modified to produce new proteins.\n\n**D. single circular DNA strand**\nThis option refers to the main bacterial chromosome, which is a large, circular DNA molecule located in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. While this chromosome contains the essential genes for the bacterium's survival, it is not typically the target for this type of genetic modification. Plasmids are used as vectors instead because they are smaller, easier to isolate and manipulate, and can exist in multiple copies within a single bacterium, leading to a much higher yield of the desired protein (insulin)."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_40.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "40 fermenters must have carefully controlled conditions.\nwhich condition has the correct reason for controlling it?\n[ [conan tobe conto [reason for contling condton\na supply of amino acids for carbohydrate synthesis\nb supply of glucose waste product to be removed\ncc supply of oxygen for anaerobic respiration\nd ph to be optimum for enzyme activity", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe pH within a fermenter must be carefully controlled because all metabolic processes, including fermentation and respiration, are catalysed by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins with a specific three-dimensional structure that is essential for their function. The pH of the surrounding medium affects this structure. Each enzyme has an optimal pH at which its activity is highest. If the pH deviates significantly from this optimum, the enzyme can become denatured\u2014its shape changes, particularly at the active site, rendering it less effective or completely inactive. As microorganisms respire and produce metabolic by-products, the pH of the culture medium can change. Therefore, maintaining the pH at the optimal level is crucial for ensuring the enzymes of the microorganisms work at their maximum rate, leading to efficient growth and product formation.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** Amino acids are the monomers, or building blocks, of proteins. They are required for protein synthesis, not carbohydrate synthesis. Carbohydrates are large biological molecules made from monosaccharide units. While a nitrogen source, which can be in the form of amino acids, is essential for the microorganisms to build their own proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds, the reason given\u2014carbohydrate synthesis\u2014is incorrect.\n\n**B:** Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary respiratory substrate or nutrient source for the microorganisms in the fermenter. It is added to provide energy and carbon atoms for growth and synthesis of the desired product. It is a reactant that is consumed, not a waste product that needs to be removed. Waste products, such as carbon dioxide and ethanol (in yeast fermentation), are the substances that are removed from the fermenter.\n\n**C:** Anaerobic respiration is a type of respiration that occurs in the complete absence of oxygen. The term \"anaerobic\" literally means \"without air\" (specifically, without oxygen). Supplying oxygen would facilitate aerobic respiration, which is a different metabolic pathway.

This organelle is often referred to as the \"powerhouse\" of the cell. While the first stage of respiration (glycolysis) takes place in the cytoplasm, the subsequent, more energy-yielding stages\u2014the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation\u2014are located within the mitochondrion. The mitochondrion's inner membrane is highly folded into cristae, which increases the surface area available for the enzymes and proteins required for these final stages of aerobic respiration, allowing for the efficient production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy currency.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. nucleus**\nThe nucleus is the control centre of the eukaryotic cell, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA). Its primary functions are to regulate all cell activities by controlling gene expression and to facilitate DNA replication during cell division. The nucleus is not involved in the metabolic pathways of cellular respiration.\n\n**C. ribosome**\nRibosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, a process known as translation.

For gas exchange in the lungs, this principle is fundamental. After inhalation, the air filling the alveoli has a high concentration (or partial pressure) of oxygen. The blood arriving at the lungs via the pulmonary artery has returned from the body tissues where oxygen was used for aerobic respiration. Consequently, this blood has a low concentration of oxygen. This difference establishes a steep concentration gradient for oxygen between the alveolar air and the blood in the surrounding capillaries. As a result, oxygen molecules move passively from the alveoli, where their concentration is high, into the blood, where their concentration is low.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The oxygen concentration in the alveolus is greater than the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood.**\n\nThis statement is not the reason for oxygen diffusion. The diffusion of a specific gas is driven by its own concentration gradient, independent of the concentrations of other gases. While the oxygen concentration in the alveoli is indeed higher than the carbon dioxide concentration in the deoxygenated blood, this comparison is irrelevant. Oxygen moves because of the difference in oxygen concentration between the alveoli and the blood, not because of a comparison with carbon dioxide.\n\n**C. The oxygen concentration in the blood is greater than the oxygen concentration in the alveolus.**\n\nThis statement describes the opposite of the conditions required for oxygen to enter the blood from the lungs. If the oxygen concentration in the blood were higher than in the alveoli, the concentration gradient would be reversed. This would cause oxygen to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli, which is physiologically incorrect. In reality, blood returning to the lungs is deoxygenated and has a much lower oxygen concentration than the air within the alveoli.\n\n**D. The oxygen concentration in the blood is greater than the carbon dioxide concentration in the alveolus.**\n\nThis statement is an irrelevant comparison. The movement of oxygen is determined solely by the oxygen concentration gradient. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the alveolus influences the diffusion of carbon dioxide (out of the blood and into the alveoli), but it does not drive the diffusion of oxygen.

Osmosis is defined as the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential across a partially permeable membrane. In this scenario, cell X has a high water potential, and cell Y has a low water potential. This difference creates a water potential gradient between the two cells. Consequently, water molecules will move down this gradient, resulting in a net flow of water from cell X into cell Y.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: equal movement between cells**\nEqual movement of water in both directions, resulting in no net change, occurs only when the two adjacent cells are in a state of dynamic equilibrium. This state is reached when the water potential in both cells is equal. Since cell X has a high water potential and cell Y has a low water potential, a gradient exists, and net movement will occur in one direction until equilibrium is approached.\n\n**C: net movement from cell Y to cell X**\nThis statement describes the opposite of what occurs. A net movement of water from cell Y to cell X would only happen if cell Y had a higher water potential than cell X. According to the principles of osmosis, water moves down the water potential gradient, not up it. Therefore, movement from a low water potential region (cell Y) to a high water potential region (cell X) is incorrect.\n\n**D: no movement between cells**\nThe cell membranes and plasmodesmata that connect plant cells are partially permeable, allowing water molecules to pass through. Movement of water will always occur as long as there is a difference in water potential between the two cells. No net movement would only be observed if the water potentials of cell X and cell Y were identical, which is not the case here.

This means it moves them from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration. Because this movement is \"uphill\" against the natural tendency of substances to diffuse, it requires an input of energy. This energy is supplied in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced during cellular respiration. The process is also highly specific and relies on membrane-spanning proteins called carrier proteins. These proteins bind to the specific substance being transported and use the energy from ATP to change their shape, thereby moving the substance across the membrane. Therefore, all three statements\u2014moving substances from a lower to a higher concentration, requiring energy from respiration, and requiring a protein carrier\u2014are correct descriptions of active transport.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A:** This option incorrectly describes active transport on all three points. A process that does not move substances against a concentration gradient, requires no energy, and uses no protein carrier is known as simple diffusion. Simple diffusion is a form of passive transport, where substances move down their concentration gradient.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect because it fails to identify two of the three fundamental characteristics of active transport. While it correctly states that a protein carrier is required, it incorrectly claims that the process does not require energy and does not move substances against a concentration gradient. A process that uses a protein carrier but does not require energy and moves substances down their concentration gradient is called facilitated diffusion, which is another form of passive transport.\n\n*   **C:** This option is incorrect because it omits the essential role of protein carriers. Although it correctly states that active transport moves substances against a concentration gradient and requires energy from respiration, it incorrectly claims that a protein carrier is not needed. Protein carriers are indispensable for active transport, as they are the structures that bind to the target substance and use energy to shuttle it across the cell membrane.

Enzyme activity is directly related to the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes.

The shapes of the substrate and the active site are complementary, allowing them to fit together, much like a key fits into a lock.\n\nAt temperature 2, which is above the optimum, the enzyme is exposed to excessive heat. This high thermal energy breaks the weak bonds (e.g., hydrogen bonds) that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional protein structure. This irreversible change in shape is called denaturation. As the enzyme's shape changes, the shape of the active site is also altered. Consequently, the active site is no longer complementary to the substrate, and the substrate can no longer bind to it. This leads to a rapid decrease in enzyme activity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The first statement incorrectly describes the interaction; the smaller substrate molecule fits into the active site, which is a specific region on the much larger enzyme molecule, not the other way around. The second statement is also incorrect. At high temperatures, it is the enzyme that changes shape (denatures), not the substrate. The substrate's molecular structure is not affected by these temperature changes.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect because enzymes and substrates do not have the same shape.

If they had the same shape, they would not be able to bind together effectively to form an enzyme-substrate complex.\n\n**C:** The statement for temperature 1 is incorrect. At temperatures below the optimum, an enzyme is not denatured; it is simply less active due to lower kinetic energy, resulting in fewer collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules.

To determine the limiting factor(s), we must consider what happens when each variable is changed.\n\n1.  **Light Intensity:** If we keep the temperature constant (the x-coordinate of point X) and increase the light intensity from \"medium\" to \"high\", the graph shows that the rate of photosynthesis increases significantly. Because increasing the light intensity increases the rate, light intensity is a limiting factor at point X.\n\n2.  **Temperature:** Point X is located on the plateau (the flat part) of the \"medium light intensity\" curve. If we move along this curve to the right of point X, the temperature increases, but the rate of photosynthesis does not. This indicates that the rate is no longer being limited by temperature; the enzymes involved are working at or near their optimal rate for the given light intensity. Therefore, temperature is not a limiting factor at point X.\n\nThus, light intensity is a limiting factor, but temperature is not.\n\n**Explanations for Incorrect Options:**\n\n*   **A:** This option is incorrect because light intensity is a limiting factor at point X. The rate of photosynthesis can be increased by providing a higher light intensity, as shown by the \"high light intensity\" curve.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. First, light intensity is a limiting factor, which this option denies.

The general structure of an amino acid includes a central carbon atom, a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, a variable R-group, and a crucial amino group (-NH\u2082). This amino group contains nitrogen.\n\nPlants synthesise their own amino acids. They obtain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water through the process of photosynthesis. However, to form the amino group, they require a source of nitrogen. Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil, primarily in the form of nitrate ions (NO\u2083\u207b). These ions are transported throughout the plant and used as the nitrogen source for synthesising all 20 types of amino acids needed to build proteins.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. magnesium**\nMagnesium ions (Mg\u00b2\u207a) are not a component of amino acids. The primary role of magnesium in plants is as the central atom in the chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll is the green pigment essential for absorbing light energy during photosynthesis. A lack of magnesium prevents chlorophyll synthesis, leading to yellowing of the leaves (chlorosis) and stunted growth, but it is not directly used to build amino acids.\n\n**C. phosphates**\nPhosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) are not incorporated into the structure of amino acids. Phosphates are essential components of other vital molecules in the plant, including ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the main energy currency of the cell, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which carry genetic information. While the synthesis of amino acids requires energy from ATP, the phosphate ions themselves do not form part of the final amino acid molecule.\n\n**D. potassium**\nPotassium ions (K\u207a) are not a structural component of amino acids. Potassium plays a crucial role as a cofactor, activating many enzymes involved in key metabolic processes like photosynthesis and respiration. It is also vital for regulating the opening and closing of stomata by controlling water potential in the guard cells.

Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase, which starts the breakdown of complex carbohydrates (starch) into simpler sugars (maltose). When the food bolus is swallowed and enters the stomach, the highly acidic environment denatures the salivary amylase, temporarily halting carbohydrate digestion. The food then passes into the small intestine, where chemical digestion of carbohydrates resumes and is completed. The pancreas releases pancreatic amylase to continue breaking down starch into maltose.

It plays a crucial role in fat digestion through a process called emulsification. Emulsification is the physical breakdown of large fat globules into much smaller fat droplets. This process significantly increases the total surface area of the fat, which allows the fat-digesting enzyme, lipase, to work more efficiently. Because emulsification involves the physical breakdown of substances without changing their chemical composition (i.e., no bonds are broken by enzymes), it is classified as a form of physical digestion.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, bile is produced in the liver, not the gall bladder; the gall bladder's function is to store and concentrate bile.

Each villus contains a dense network of capillaries. Absorbed glucose rapidly enters these capillaries and is carried away by the bloodstream. This maintains a high concentration gradient between the glucose in the lumen of the small intestine and the glucose in the blood, ensuring a continuous and rapid rate of absorption.\n\n2.  **Microvilli (Statement 3):** The epithelial cells that cover each villus have their own cell surface membranes folded into microscopic projections called microvilli.

This transfer of pre-made antibodies provides immediate, though temporary, protection against a specific pathogen. Examples include a fetus receiving antibodies from its mother across the placenta or a person receiving an injection of antiserum (e.g., for a snake bite or tetanus).\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nGaining immunity through infection with a pathogen is a form of **natural active immunity**. In this process, the individual's immune system is exposed to antigens from the pathogen, triggering a primary immune response. This response involves the production of the individual's own antibodies and the formation of memory cells, leading to long-term protection. This is fundamentally different from passive immunity, which involves receiving antibodies without an active immune response.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: C\n\nPassive immunity provides only **short-term protection**. The antibodies received from another individual are foreign proteins that are eventually broken down and eliminated by the recipient's body. Since the recipient's immune system was not stimulated to produce its own antibodies or memory cells, the immunity wanes as the donated antibodies are cleared. Long-term protection is a characteristic of active immunity, which establishes an immunological memory.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nMemory cells are not produced in passive immunity. The production of memory cells (both B and T lymphocytes) is a hallmark of **active immunity**. These cells are generated when an individual's immune system actively responds to an antigen, either from an infection or a vaccine. Because passive immunity involves bypassing the recipient's immune response by directly providing antibodies, the cellular machinery for creating memory cells is not activated.

A major waste product of aerobic respiration is carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide diffuses from the active muscle tissues into the bloodstream, causing its concentration in the blood to rise. The increase in carbon dioxide lowers the pH of the blood (making it more acidic). This change in pH is detected by chemoreceptors located in the medulla oblongata of the brain and in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These receptors send nerve signals to the respiratory centre in the medulla, which in turn stimulates the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to contract more frequently and forcefully. This results in an increased rate and depth of breathing, which helps to expel the excess carbon dioxide and restore normal blood pH.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nWhile it is true that muscle cells consume more oxygen from the blood during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in blood oxygen concentration, this is not the primary stimulus for increasing the breathing rate under normal conditions. The respiratory control centres in the brain are far more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide concentration and the resulting blood pH than they are to changes in oxygen levels. A significant increase in breathing rate triggered by low oxygen (hypoxia) only occurs when oxygen levels fall to critically low levels, which is not a typical physiological response to standard athletic exertion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nUrea is a nitrogenous waste product formed in the liver from the breakdown of excess amino acids and is primarily excreted by the kidneys via urine. The rate of breathing is not regulated by the concentration of urea in the blood. Furthermore, exercise does not cause a decrease in blood urea concentration; intense, prolonged exercise may even slightly increase its production. Therefore, changes in urea levels are not responsible for the respiratory response shown.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nRed blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. The concentration of red blood cells does not increase rapidly in response to short-term exercise. The production of new red blood cells (erythropoiesis) is a slow process that takes several days to weeks.

Following the digestion of proteins into amino acids in the alimentary canal, these amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported directly to the liver via the hepatic portal vein. The liver plays a central role in the assimilation of these amino acids. It actively synthesizes numerous essential proteins required by the body, such as plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, which regulates osmotic pressure, and fibrinogen, which is crucial for blood clotting). This synthesis of new proteins from absorbed amino acids is a key aspect of assimilation. The liver also processes any excess amino acids through a process called deamination.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B:** The organ labelled B is a lung. The primary function of the lungs is gas exchange\u2014the intake of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide. While lung cells, like all living cells, synthesize proteins for their own growth, repair, and function, this is not their major physiological role, and they are not the central organ for processing amino acids for the rest of the body.\n*   **C:** The organ labelled C is a kidney. The kidneys are the main organs of the urinary system. Their primary functions are to filter waste products, such as urea, from the blood to form urine and to regulate the water and salt balance of the body (osmoregulation). The kidneys are involved in the excretion of nitrogenous waste derived from amino acid breakdown, but they do not have a major role in synthesising proteins from amino acids for systemic use.\n*   **D:** The organ labelled D is the urinary bladder.

At a neuromuscular junction, a motor neurone releases neurotransmitters that diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific protein receptors on the muscle fibre. This binding event initiates a series of chemical changes that lead to muscle contraction. Because the toxin has a molecular shape that is complementary to these receptors, it can bind to them, just like the natural neurotransmitter. However, the toxin does not trigger the contraction response. By occupying the receptor sites, it physically obstructs the natural neurotransmitter from binding. Consequently, the signal to contract is not transmitted to the muscle fibre, and muscle contraction is prevented. This mechanism is known as competitive inhibition.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B: The toxin increases the release of neurotransmitters from relay neurones.**\n    This statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, muscle contraction is initiated by motor neurones synapsing directly onto muscle fibres, not relay neurones (interneurons). Relay neurones are typically found within the central nervous system, connecting sensory and motor pathways. Secondly, increasing the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter would cause or enhance muscle contraction, which is the opposite of the effect described in the question.\n\n*   **C: The toxin increases the release of neurotransmitters from sensory neurones.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Sensory neurones transmit nerve impulses from sensory receptors (e.g., in the skin) to the central nervous system. They do not form synapses with muscle fibres to initiate contraction. Furthermore, as with option B, an increase in neurotransmitter release would not lead to the prevention of muscle contraction.\n\n*   **D: The toxin stimulates impulses in motor neurones.**\n    This statement describes an action that would have the opposite effect. Stimulating impulses in motor neurones would cause them to release more neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction.

When a population of bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic, individuals with natural variations that make them resistant are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to an increase in the frequency of resistance genes in the bacterial population.\n\n*   **Factor 1: regularly giving antibiotics to healthy livestock**\n    This practice significantly increases the development of antibiotic resistance. When antibiotics are used non-therapeutically, such as for promoting growth or preventing disease in healthy animals, it exposes a vast number of bacteria in the animals' environment and gut to the drug. This creates a strong selective pressure, eliminating susceptible bacteria and allowing any resistant bacteria to thrive and multiply. These resistant strains can then be transmitted to humans through the food chain or environmental contact.\n\n*   **Factor 3: using several different antibiotics to treat an infection**\n    While combination therapy is a specific medical strategy used by doctors for severe infections, the general or improper use of multiple antibiotics can increase resistance. This can occur when a patient does not complete the full course of one antibiotic and then switches to another for the same infection. This exposes the surviving bacteria to different selective pressures, which can promote the evolution of strains resistant to multiple drugs (multi-drug resistance).\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A (1 and 2)**\n    Factor 2, `only using antibiotics to treat bacterial infections`, is a measure to *reduce* antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Using them only for bacterial infections ensures they are not used unnecessarily, which would otherwise expose the body's natural bacterial flora to the antibiotic, creating selective pressure without any clinical benefit.

Factor 2, `only using antibiotics to treat bacterial infections`, prevents unnecessary exposure.

Its primary function is to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovary during the first half of the menstrual cycle, known as the follicular phase. This is reflected by a moderate increase in its concentration at the beginning of the cycle. FSH levels, along with Luteinizing Hormone (LH), also experience a smaller surge around day 14, which contributes to ovulation. The curve labelled B accurately depicts this pattern: a rise in the early follicular phase followed by a distinct, but smaller, peak at mid-cycle.\n\n***\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** This curve represents Luteinizing Hormone (LH). LH is also released by the pituitary gland. While its levels are relatively low for most of the cycle, it experiences a very large and sharp surge around day 14. This LH surge is the primary trigger for ovulation, the release of a mature egg from the ovary. The prominent, sharp peak shown by curve A is characteristic of the LH surge, not the more modest peaks of FSH.\n\n*   **C:** This curve represents Oestrogen. Oestrogen is an ovarian hormone produced by the developing follicles. Its concentration rises steadily throughout the follicular phase, as the follicle grows under the stimulation of FSH. The peak concentration of oestrogen, occurring just before day 14, is responsible for stimulating the LH surge (positive feedback) and also causes the repair and proliferation of the uterine lining (endometrium). This pattern of a pre-ovulatory peak is distinct from the FSH profile.\n\n*   **D:** This curve represents Progesterone. Progesterone is another ovarian hormone, produced in large quantities by the corpus luteum, which develops from the ruptured follicle after ovulation. Therefore, its concentration remains low during the first half of the cycle and rises significantly only after day 14. Progesterone's main role is to maintain the uterine lining in preparation for a potential pregnancy and to inhibit the release of FSH and LH.

Seed shape in pea plants, as studied by Gregor Mendel, is a classic example of this. The seeds are either round or wrinkled; there are no intermediate shapes. This trait is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, leading to these distinct phenotypes.

ABO blood groups show continuous variation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The ABO blood group system in humans results in four distinct phenotypes: blood group A, blood group B, blood group AB, and blood group O.

It is a two-step biological process carried out by specific groups of soil bacteria. In the first step, ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a) are oxidised to nitrite ions (NO\u2082\u207b). In the second step, nitrite ions are further oxidised to nitrate ions (NO\u2083\u207b). Therefore, the overall process involves the conversion of ammonium ions (the chemical changed) into nitrate ions (the chemical produced). Nitrate is the primary form of nitrogen absorbed by plant roots.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** Decomposition, also known as ammonification, is the process by which decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down complex organic nitrogen compounds, such as proteins and nucleic acids from dead organisms and waste products, into ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a). The option incorrectly states that ammonium ions are converted into protein.

Plasmids are crucial tools in genetic modification because they can be easily isolated from bacteria, modified in a laboratory, and then reintroduced into other bacteria.\n\nIn genetic engineering, a desired gene (for example, the gene for human insulin) is inserted into the plasmid using enzymes. This modified plasmid, now called a recombinant plasmid, is then introduced into a host bacterium. The bacterium takes up the plasmid and, as it reproduces, it also replicates the plasmid, creating many copies of the inserted gene. The host bacteria can then be used to produce large quantities of the protein encoded by the new gene. This use of plasmids as a vehicle to transfer genetic material makes them a fundamental tool in biotechnology.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Structure A is the cell wall.

Egestion is the removal of undigested food materials (faeces) from the body. This process only occurs in organisms that ingest food, such as animals.

Adenine (A), a purine base, always pairs with Thymine (T), a pyrimidine base. This specific pairing is due to their chemical structures, which allow for the formation of two stable hydrogen bonds between them. This rule of complementary base pairing, where A pairs with T and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G), is fundamental to the structure and replication of DNA. The pairing of a larger purine with a smaller pyrimidine ensures a consistent diameter along the entire DNA molecule.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\nThis pairing is incorrect. Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are both classified as purine bases, which have a larger, double-ring chemical structure. If two purines were to pair together, the resulting \"rung\" of the DNA ladder would be too wide, causing a distortion in the uniform structure of the double helix.

At temperatures significantly above this optimum, such as 80\u00b0C, the high kinetic energy causes the atoms within the enzyme molecule to vibrate vigorously. This disrupts and breaks the weak bonds (like hydrogen bonds) that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional tertiary structure. This irreversible change in shape is called denaturation. As the structure of the enzyme is critical for its function, denaturation renders the enzyme inactive.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**B. The shape of the active site is stable.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The active site is a specific region of the enzyme whose shape is determined by the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein. When an enzyme denatures at high temperatures, its entire structure, including the active site, is altered. Therefore, the shape of the active site is not stable; it is irreversibly changed, preventing it from binding to its substrate.\n\n**C. More enzyme-substrate complexes form.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An enzyme-substrate complex is formed when a substrate molecule binds to the complementary active site of an enzyme. Since high temperatures cause the enzyme to denature and alter the shape of its active site, the substrate can no longer fit and bind effectively. Consequently, the rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes decreases dramatically, eventually stopping altogether.\n\n**D. More product is formed by the enzyme.**\nThis statement is incorrect.

However, the rate of photosynthesis will be significantly higher than the rate of respiration. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the surrounding water, while respiration releases it. Due to the higher rate of photosynthesis, there is a net removal of CO\u2082 from the hydrogencarbonate indicator solution. Hydrogencarbonate indicator is sensitive to the concentration of CO\u2082; a decrease in CO\u2082 concentration causes the solution to become more alkaline, which in turn causes the indicator to change colour from orange to purple.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A blue-black:** A blue-black colour is the positive result for the iodine test for starch. The experiment described uses hydrogencarbonate indicator to measure changes in carbon dioxide concentration, not iodine to test for the presence of starch.\n\n**B orange:** The hydrogencarbonate indicator solution is orange at the start of the experiment, which corresponds to a normal atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. For the colour to remain orange, there would have to be no net change in the CO\u2082 concentration. This would only occur if the rate of photosynthesis was exactly equal to the rate of respiration, which is highly unlikely under these conditions, or if the plant was not photosynthesising. Since the plant is in the light, there will be a net consumption of CO\u2082, leading to a colour change.\n\n**D yellow:** A yellow colour in hydrogencarbonate indicator signifies a high concentration of carbon dioxide. This would occur if the rate of respiration were greater than the rate of photosynthesis, leading to a net release of CO\u2082 into the solution. This typically happens when the plant is in the dark and only respiring.

The rate of this process is influenced by several environmental factors. A limiting factor is a variable that is in short supply and thus restricts the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Carbon dioxide (1):** Carbon dioxide is a primary reactant in photosynthesis. It is used during the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is low, the rate of photosynthesis will be slow, even if there is abundant light and water. Therefore, carbon dioxide is a key limiting factor.\n*   **Light intensity (3):** Light provides the energy that drives photosynthesis. The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH). If light intensity is low, these reactions slow down, which in turn limits the overall rate of photosynthesis, regardless of the availability of other factors. Therefore, light intensity is also a crucial limiting factor.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A (1 and 2):** This option is incorrect because oxygen (2) is a product of photosynthesis, not a reactant or a necessary condition. The balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082.

Oxygen (2) is a product of photosynthesis. It is not required for the process to occur and therefore cannot be a limiting factor in the way that a scarce resource would be.\n*   **D (3 only):** This option is incorrect because it is incomplete. While light intensity (3) is a major limiting factor, carbon dioxide (1) is also an essential reactant. The rate of photosynthesis can be limited by a shortage of either factor.

The structure of haemoglobin includes four 'haem' groups, each containing a single iron atom at its centre. This iron atom is what enables haemoglobin to bind reversibly with oxygen. A sufficient dietary intake of iron is therefore essential for the body to produce an adequate amount of haemoglobin. A low haemoglobin concentration, as described in the scenario (80 g/dm\u00b3), is a primary indicator of anaemia. The most common cause of anaemia worldwide is iron deficiency, which results from a diet lacking in iron-rich foods.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. calcium**\nCalcium is a mineral that is vital for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It also plays a crucial role in nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and blood clotting. However, calcium is not a component of the haemoglobin molecule and is not directly involved in its synthesis. A deficiency in calcium leads to conditions such as rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults, but it does not cause a low haemoglobin concentration.\n\n**B. fats**\nFats, or lipids, are essential macronutrients used by the body as a major source of energy, for insulation, to protect vital organs, and for the synthesis of certain hormones and cell membranes. While a balanced diet requires an appropriate amount of healthy fats, they are not a structural component of haemoglobin. A lack of fat in the diet would lead to other health issues, such as a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins, but it is not the direct cause of low haemoglobin levels.\n\n**C. fibre**\nDietary fibre is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested by human enzymes. Its primary role is to maintain the health of the digestive system by adding bulk to the faeces, which aids in peristalsis and prevents constipation. Fibre is not absorbed into the bloodstream and has no metabolic function in the synthesis of proteins like haemoglobin.

This action, which includes chewing in the mouth and churning in the stomach, significantly increases the surface area-to-volume ratio of the food. A larger surface area allows digestive enzymes to access and act upon the food more effectively, thereby increasing the rate of chemical digestion.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** The involvement of enzymes is the defining characteristic of chemical digestion, not physical digestion. Enzymes are biological catalysts that break the chemical bonds within large, complex food molecules to form smaller, simpler molecules. Physical digestion is a purely mechanical process that does not alter the chemical nature of the food.\n\n**C:** While physical digestion begins in the mouth with mastication (chewing), it is not the only location where it occurs. The muscular walls of the stomach perform churning movements (a form of peristalsis) that further mix and break down the food. Additionally, in the small intestine, bile salts emulsify large fat globules into smaller droplets, which is also a form of physical digestion.\n\n**D:** Physical digestion produces smaller *particles* or *pieces* of food, but it does not produce smaller *molecules*. The chemical composition of the food remains unchanged. For example, chewing a piece of bread breaks it into smaller crumbs, but the starch molecules within the crumbs are not broken down.

This loss occurs via diffusion, which is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The rate of diffusion is determined by the steepness of the concentration gradient.\n\nIn conditions of low atmospheric humidity, the air surrounding the leaf is dry, meaning it has a very low concentration of water vapour. In contrast, the air spaces inside the leaf are saturated with water vapour, creating a high concentration. This large difference in water vapour concentration between the inside and outside of the leaf establishes a steep concentration gradient. As a result, water vapour diffuses rapidly out of the stomata into the atmosphere, leading to a high rate of transpiration.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. In high humidity, the transpiration rate is high because there is slow diffusion of water vapour through stomata.**\nThis statement is contradictory. A high transpiration rate would be caused by rapid diffusion, not slow diffusion. Furthermore, in high humidity, the transpiration rate is low, not high, because the concentration gradient of water vapour between the leaf and the atmosphere is shallow, leading to slow diffusion.\n\n**B. In high humidity, the transpiration rate is low because there is rapid diffusion of water vapour through stomata.**\nThis statement contains incorrect reasoning. While it is true that the transpiration rate is low in high humidity, this is due to a *slow* rate of diffusion. High humidity means the external air has a high concentration of water vapour, which reduces the concentration gradient between the inside of the leaf and the atmosphere. This shallow gradient slows down the rate of diffusion.\n\n**D. In low humidity, the transpiration rate is low because there is slow diffusion of water vapour through stomata.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Low humidity creates a steep water vapour concentration gradient between the leaf's interior and the surrounding air. This steep gradient causes rapid diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata, resulting in a *high* rate of transpiration, not a low one."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_96.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "16 sucrose and amino acids move around a plant from sources to sinks.\nwhich row shows the sources and sinks?\npalisade\nroot cortex cells xylem vessels\nmesophyll cells\na source and sink neither source\nb sink sink source and sink\ncc neither source and sink sink\nd source and sink source neither", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation:\n\n**A is the correct answer.**\n\nIn plant transport, a **source** is a region where sugars (like sucrose) and amino acids are produced (e.g., by photosynthesis) or released from storage, leading to a net export of these substances. A **sink** is a region that consumes or stores these substances, leading to a net import.\n\n*   **Palisade mesophyll cells:** These are the primary sites of photosynthesis in the leaves. They produce large quantities of glucose, which is converted to sucrose for transport. As they produce far more sucrose than they consume for their own metabolic needs, they are a major **source**.\n*   **Root cortex cells:** These cells are non-photosynthetic and require a constant supply of sucrose and amino acids for cellular respiration and growth. They are therefore a major **sink**. However, many roots also function as storage organs, converting imported sucrose into starch. During periods when the plant needs energy and photosynthetic rates are low (e.g., winter or early spring), this stored starch is converted back to sucrose and exported to other parts of the plant. In this case, the root cortex cells act as a **source**. Thus, they can be both a source and a sink.\n*   **Xylem vessels:** These vessels are part of the plant's water transport system, moving water and mineral ions from the roots to the leaves. They are composed of dead cells that lack cytoplasm and do not carry out metabolic processes. The transport of sucrose and amino acids occurs in the phloem. Therefore, xylem vessels are **neither** a source nor a sink for these organic molecules.\n\nThis combination correctly identifies the roles of all three cell types.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B is incorrect.** Xylem vessels are incorrectly identified as a sink. Xylem vessels are dead, hollow tubes responsible for water transport (transpiration stream) and are not involved in the transport or use of sucrose and amino acids. Furthermore, while palisade mesophyll cells do use some of the sugar they produce, their primary role in the context of whole-plant transport is as a net exporter, making them a source, not a sink.\n\n**C is incorrect.** This option contains multiple errors. Root cortex cells are major sinks and potential sources, not 'neither'. Xylem vessels are neither a source nor a sink. Palisade mesophyll cells are the primary source of sugars, not a sink. A sink is a net importer of sugars, whereas palisade cells are net exporters.\n\n**D is incorrect.** Xylem vessels are incorrectly identified as a source.

This secretion significantly increases the solute concentration within the intestinal lumen, which in turn lowers its water potential. Consequently, a steep water potential gradient is established between the blood plasma (higher water potential) and the intestinal lumen (lower water potential). Water then moves by osmosis down this gradient, from the blood and surrounding tissues across the intestinal epithelium and into the lumen. This massive influx of water into the intestine results in severe, watery diarrhoea, leading to the characteristic dehydration and loss of salts from the body.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Chloride ions are secreted into the small intestine where they increase the water potential.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the addition of solutes, such as chloride ions, to a solvent (water) always *decreases* the water potential. Water potential is a measure of the potential energy of water; pure water has the highest possible water potential (zero). As solutes are added, the water potential becomes more negative (decreases).

The secretion of chloride ions into the small intestine lowers the water potential inside the intestine relative to the blood.

The primary event triggered by the cholera toxin is the secretion of chloride ions into the intestine, which directly lowers the water potential of the intestinal lumen.

To compensate, muscle cells begin to respire anaerobically. Anaerobic respiration in humans produces lactic acid and creates an 'oxygen debt'. This debt is the amount of extra oxygen the body needs after exercise to break down the accumulated lactic acid and restore normal metabolic conditions.\n\nOn the graph, the exercise period ends at 15 minutes. Following this, the oxygen consumption remains significantly elevated above the initial resting rate (seen from 0-5 minutes) and gradually declines. This period of elevated oxygen intake after exercise has ceased is known as Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC), where the oxygen debt is being 'repaid'. The oxygen consumption returns to the resting level at approximately 20 minutes, indicating that the debt has been fully removed by this time.

This glucose-rich blood is circulated throughout the body, including to the kidneys for filtration.\n\n1.  **Renal Artery:** This vessel carries unfiltered blood from the general circulation to the kidney. As the blood contains glucose absorbed from the meal, glucose will be present in the renal artery.\n2.  **Renal Vein:** This vessel carries filtered blood away from the kidney. The kidney cells themselves use some glucose for respiration. Furthermore, not all blood that enters the kidney is filtered in one pass, and reabsorbed glucose returns to this blood. Therefore, the blood in the renal vein still contains glucose.\n3.  **Glomerulus:** This is a capillary network where blood filtration begins. Glucose is a small, soluble molecule that is present in the blood plasma flowing through the glomerulus.\n4.  **Nephron:** During ultrafiltration, small molecules like water, salts, urea, and glucose are forced from the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule, which is the start of the nephron. This fluid is called the glomerular filtrate. Therefore, glucose is present in the initial part of the nephron.\n5.  **Ureter:** As the glomerular filtrate passes along the nephron (specifically, the proximal convoluted tubule), all of the glucose is actively transported back into the blood. In a healthy individual, this reabsorption is 100% complete. The remaining fluid, now urine, passes into the ureter. Consequently, the urine in the ureter of a healthy person contains no glucose.\n\nRow C correctly identifies that glucose is present in the renal artery, renal vein, glomerulus, and the nephron's filtrate, but absent from the urine in the ureter.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it states that glucose is absent from the renal vein and present in the ureter. Blood in the renal vein must contain glucose to supply the kidney cells and because it is the same blood that has been processed by the kidney. In a healthy person, all glucose is reabsorbed from the filtrate, so it should be absent from the urine in the ureter.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that glucose is absent from the glomerulus and the nephron. Glucose is present in the blood that flows through the glomerulus and is filtered from the blood into the nephron tubule as part of the glomerular filtrate.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. It claims glucose is absent from the renal artery, which is the primary vessel supplying glucose-rich blood to the kidney. It also incorrectly states that glucose is absent from the glomerulus and nephron, while being present in the ureter.

This is achieved by making the lens thinner and less convex. The process involves the relaxation of the ciliary muscles. When the ciliary muscles relax, the diameter of the ciliary body increases, moving it further from the lens. This pulls on the suspensory ligaments, causing them to become taut or tight. The tension exerted by the tight suspensory ligaments pulls the elastic lens, causing it to flatten and become thin. This decreases its refractive power, allowing parallel light rays from distant objects to be focused correctly onto the retina.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the process of accommodation for focusing on **near** objects. To focus on near objects, whose light rays are diverging, the eye must increase its refractive power. This is achieved by the ciliary muscles contracting, which reduces the diameter of the ciliary body. This, in turn, slackens the suspensory ligaments. With the tension released, the naturally elastic lens bulges and becomes fatter (more convex), increasing its refractive power.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option presents a physiologically inconsistent combination of events. It correctly states that the suspensory ligaments are tight when focusing on distant objects. However, it incorrectly states that the ciliary muscle contracts and the lens becomes fat. Contraction of the ciliary muscle leads to slack suspensory ligaments and a fatter lens, which are actions for focusing on near objects. Therefore, the combination of a contracting ciliary muscle and tight suspensory ligaments cannot occur.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option presents a physiologically inconsistent combination of events. It correctly states that the ciliary muscle relaxes and the lens becomes thin when focusing on distant objects. However, it incorrectly states that the suspensory ligaments become slack. The relaxation of the ciliary muscle increases tension on the suspensory ligaments, causing them to tighten, not slacken.

It stimulates cell elongation.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Auxin is a key plant hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating growth. One of its primary functions in the shoots is to promote cell elongation. It does this by increasing the elasticity of the cell walls, which allows the cells to take up more water by osmosis and expand in length. This process is fundamental to the overall growth of the plant shoot and is the mechanism behind tropisms, such as the bending of a shoot towards light.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. It is made only on the shaded side of the shoot.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Auxin is primarily synthesized in the apical meristem, which is located at the very tip of the shoot. From there, it diffuses downwards. In the presence of unilateral light (light coming from one side), auxin is transported laterally from the illuminated side to the shaded side. Therefore, while it accumulates on the shaded side, it is not produced there.\n\n**B. It is more concentrated on the side of the shoot that receives the most light.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. In response to light, auxin exhibits a behaviour known as lateral transport. It moves away from the light source. Consequently, the concentration of auxin becomes higher on the shaded side of the shoot and lower on the side receiving direct light. This higher concentration on the shaded side stimulates greater cell elongation there, causing the shoot to bend towards the light source (a phenomenon known as positive phototropism).\n\n**C. It moves through the shoot by osmosis.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Osmosis is the specific term for the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. Auxin is a hormone, not water. It is transported through the plant via other processes, primarily active transport through specialized cells in the vascular tissues (phloem parenchyma) and by diffusion over shorter distances."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_107.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "27 whatis a correct statement about antibiotics?\na_ bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of artificial selection.\nb_ bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of natural selection.\nc_ viruses may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of artificial selection.\nd_ viruses may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of natural selection.", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. The process occurs as follows:\n1.  **Variation:** Within any large population of bacteria, random mutations can occur, leading to genetic variation. Some of these mutations may incidentally confer resistance to an antibiotic.\n2.  **Selection Pressure:** When an antibiotic is used, it creates a strong environmental selection pressure. It kills the bacteria that are susceptible to it.\n3.  **Survival and Reproduction:** The few bacteria that possess the resistance mutation are not killed. They survive and continue to reproduce, passing the resistance gene to their offspring.\n4.  **Increased Frequency:** Over time, the resistant bacteria will multiply and become the dominant type in the population.\n\nThis process, where the environment (the presence of the antibiotic) selects for individuals with an advantageous heritable trait (resistance), is the definition of natural selection.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of artificial selection.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the process described is natural selection, not artificial selection. Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of organisms by humans to promote desired traits, such as breeding cows for higher milk yield or crops for drought resistance. In the case of antibiotic resistance, humans are not intentionally selecting for resistant bacteria; rather, the resistance evolves as an unintended consequence of using antibiotics. The antibiotic itself acts as a natural environmental pressure.\n\n**C) Viruses may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of artificial selection.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Antibiotics work by targeting specific structures or metabolic pathways in bacterial cells (such as cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis), which viruses lack. Since antibiotics cannot kill viruses, viruses cannot develop resistance to them. Secondly, as explained for option A, the process of developing resistance is a result of natural, not artificial, selection.\n\n**D) Viruses may become resistant to antibiotics as a result of natural selection.**\nThis statement is incorrect because its fundamental premise is flawed.

The analysis shows that individuals 5, 6, and 7 also must be heterozygous. Option C provides a more comprehensive list of individuals who must be heterozygous.\n\n**B) 4 and 7:**\nThis option is incorrect because it cannot be concluded that individual 4 **must** be heterozygous. Individual 4 is an unaffected child of two heterozygous parents (individuals 1 and 2, both Aa). The possible genotypes for their unaffected offspring are homozygous dominant (AA) or heterozygous (Aa). Without further information, such as her having an affected child, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that she is AA. Therefore, she is not an individual who *must* be heterozygous.\n\n**D) 5 and 6 only:**\nThis option is incomplete. Although it correctly identifies that individuals 5 and 6 must be heterozygous (as they are unaffected parents of an affected child), it omits individual 7, who also must be heterozygous.

This can be a change in the base sequence of DNA within a gene, or a change in the structure or number of chromosomes. Because it is a direct alteration of the genetic code, it is the correct term for a genetic change. Mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation and can lead to the formation of new alleles.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: allele**\nAn **allele** is an alternative form or version of a gene. For example, the gene for seed shape in pea plants has two alleles: one for round seeds and one for wrinkled seeds. While new alleles arise as a result of mutations (genetic changes), the term 'allele' itself refers to the specific variant of a gene, not the process of change. It describes a state of genetic information, not its alteration.\n\n**B: genotype**\nThe **genotype** refers to the specific combination of alleles that an organism possesses for a particular gene or set of genes. For example, if 'B' is the allele for brown eyes and 'b' is the allele for blue eyes, an individual's genotype for eye colour could be BB, Bb, or bb. The genotype is a description of the organism's genetic makeup, not a change to it. A mutation can alter a genotype, but the term 'genotype' itself describes the existing set of alleles.\n\n**D: phenotype**\nThe **phenotype** is the observable physical, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of an organism, which result from the expression of its genotype in a particular environment. For example, having brown eyes is a phenotype. The phenotype is the physical manifestation of the genes, not a change within the genes themselves. A genetic change (mutation) can lead to a change in the phenotype, but the phenotype is the outcome, not the genetic alteration itself."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_114.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "34 which adaptation may be present in a xerophyte?\na leaves with small surface area and large numbers of stomata\nb little or no xylem tissue and leaves with large surface area\nc stomatal hairs and rolled leaves\nd_ thin or no cuticle and deep roots", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nA xerophyte is a plant adapted to survive in an environment with little available water. Its adaptations are primarily focused on reducing water loss, which mainly occurs through transpiration from the leaves.\n\n*   **Stomatal hairs** (also known as trichomes) are fine, hair-like outgrowths on the leaf epidermis. They trap a layer of still, moist air close to the leaf surface, particularly around the stomata. This reduces the water potential gradient between the humid air inside the leaf and the drier air outside. As a result, the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata (transpiration) is significantly decreased.\n*   **Rolled leaves**, a feature of plants like marram grass, involve the leaf curling inwards. This encloses the stomata, which are typically located on the inner surface of the leaf, within a humid, protected microenvironment. Similar to stomatal hairs, this mechanism traps water vapour, reduces the water potential gradient, and lowers the rate of transpiration by sheltering the stomata from wind and dry air.\n\nBoth stomatal hairs and rolled leaves are classic examples of xerophytic adaptations to conserve water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: leaves with small surface area and large numbers of stomata**\nWhile having leaves with a small surface area (or leaves modified into spines, like in cacti) is a valid xerophytic adaptation to reduce the area for water loss, having a large number of stomata would be disadvantageous. Stomata are the primary sites of transpiration; therefore, a large number would increase the potential for water loss, contradicting the survival needs of a xerophyte. Xerophytes typically have a low density of stomata.\n\n**B: little or no xylem tissue and leaves with large surface area**\nThis statement describes adaptations that are the opposite of what a xerophyte needs. Xylem tissue is essential for transporting water from the roots to the leaves. A plant in a dry environment would need an efficient and well-developed xylem system to move any available water. Furthermore, leaves with a large surface area would dramatically increase the rate of transpiration, leading to rapid dehydration.\n\n**D: thin or no cuticle and deep roots**\nWhile deep roots are a common adaptation for xerophytes, allowing them to access water from deep within the soil, the first part of this statement is incorrect. The cuticle is a waxy, waterproof layer on the leaf's surface that prevents water loss directly from epidermal cells (cuticular transpiration). A xerophyte would possess a very thick waxy cuticle to minimise this form of water loss. A thin or absent cuticle would result in excessive and uncontrolled dehydration, which would be fatal in a dry environment."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_115.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "35 the diagram shows energy flow from the sun, through a food chain and into the environment.\nvi /\n. 2 .\nplant \u2014\u2014\u2014-> animal \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014~ animal\nwhat is the form of energy for each numbered arrow?\n[seve | steee2 |\na heat chemical\nb heat kinetic\ncc light chemical\nd light kinetic", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\n*   **Stage 1 (light):** The Sun is the primary source of energy for almost all ecosystems on Earth.

This is represented on the graph by a positive slope (the curve is rising).\n\n*   **Phase 1 (Lag Phase):** The curve has a positive, albeit shallow, slope. This indicates that the population is beginning to increase as the yeast cells adapt to the new environment. Therefore, the reproduction rate is greater than the death rate.\n*   **Phase 2 (Log/Exponential Phase):** The curve has a steep positive slope, indicating a rapid increase in population size. This is the period of maximum growth, where the reproduction rate is significantly greater than the death rate due to abundant nutrients and space.\n*   **Phase 3 (Stationary Phase):** The slope of the curve decreases and becomes zero at the peak.

Introducing fishing quotas directly addresses this problem. Quotas are scientifically determined legal limits on the total quantity of fish that can be caught in a specific area over a period. By restricting the catch to sustainable levels, quotas allow the fish stock to stabilise and recover. This ensures that enough adult tuna survive to reproduce, helping to rebuild the population over time. It is the most direct and effective large-scale conservation method to combat overfishing.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decreasing the size of holes in fishing nets**\nThis method would be counterproductive to conservation efforts. Smaller holes in fishing nets would trap smaller, younger fish that have not yet reached sexual maturity. Removing these juvenile fish from the population before they have had a chance to reproduce would severely hinder the stock's ability to recover and would accelerate its decline. Conservation strategies often advocate for *increasing* the mesh size of nets to allow young fish to escape.\n\n**B: genetic modification of tuna**\nGenetic modification is a technique used to alter the genetic material of an organism, typically to enhance certain traits like growth rate or disease resistance. This is primarily a tool for aquaculture (fish farming), not for the conservation of wild populations. Releasing genetically modified tuna into the ocean would pose significant and unpredictable ecological risks, potentially harming the native gene pool and the wider ecosystem. Furthermore, this approach does not address the root cause of the population decline, which is excessive fishing.\n\n**D: selective breeding of tuna**\nSelective breeding involves choosing individuals with desirable characteristics to be parents of the next generation. Like genetic modification, this is a method used to improve stocks in controlled aquaculture environments, not to conserve wild populations. It would be highly impractical to capture, breed, and then release enough selectively bred tuna to have a significant impact on the vast Atlantic Ocean population.

The provided information states that bloodworms are organisms found in heavily polluted water. Therefore, the area with the least pollution will have the fewest bloodworms. The diagram shows the direction of the river's flow is from left to right. Point A is located upstream, before the point where raw sewage is introduced. As the pollutants from the sewage are carried downstream, the water at point A remains unpolluted by this source. Unpolluted water typically has high levels of dissolved oxygen and is not a suitable habitat for bloodworms, which are adapted to low-oxygen, polluted conditions. Consequently, point A would have the fewest bloodworms.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nPoint B is located immediately downstream from the input of raw sewage. Raw sewage is a major pollutant containing a high concentration of organic matter. Decomposer microorganisms, such as bacteria, will feed on this organic matter, multiplying rapidly. Their respiration consumes a large amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to severe oxygen depletion (eutrophication). Bloodworms are indicator species that thrive in such heavily polluted, low-oxygen environments. Therefore, point B would likely have the highest concentration of bloodworms, not the fewest.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nPoint C is located downstream from the sewage input. The pollutants and organic matter from the sewage are carried by the river's current to this location. While some dilution and breakdown of pollutants may have started to occur, the water at point C is still significantly polluted compared to the unpolluted water at point A. The oxygen levels would still be low, providing a suitable habitat for bloodworms. Thus, a significant number of bloodworms would be expected at point C.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nPoint D is the furthest downstream location shown. As water flows from the pollution source, a natural process of self-purification occurs. This involves the gradual breakdown of pollutants by microorganisms and the re-oxygenation of the water from the atmosphere and photosynthesis by aquatic plants. While the water quality at point D might be slightly better than at points B and C, it will still be more polluted than the water at point A, which is upstream of the pollution source. Therefore, the conditions at D would still support a population of bloodworms, and there would be far fewer at point A."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_119.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "39 the diagram shows a bacterial cell.\nwhich part is useful in genetic modification?\nb c\na\nd", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nStructure D is a plasmid, which is a small, circular loop of DNA found in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells, separate from the main chromosome. Plasmids are key tools in genetic modification, where they are used as vectors to carry foreign DNA into host cells. In this process, a desired gene (for example, the human gene for insulin) is isolated and inserted into the plasmid using specific enzymes (restriction enzymes and DNA ligase). This modified plasmid, now called a recombinant plasmid, is then introduced into host bacteria. As the bacteria reproduce, they replicate the plasmid, and can also express the new gene to produce the desired protein. The small size and simple structure of plasmids make them easy to isolate, modify, and introduce into other cells.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nStructure A represents the cell wall and cell membrane of the bacterium. The cell wall provides structural support and protection, while the cell membrane controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.

It is the site of most of the cell's metabolic activities and contains ribosomes, enzymes, and various solutes. While the processes of genetic modification occur within the cytoplasm, the cytoplasm itself is not the genetic tool used to transfer genes. It is the medium in which the genetic material (chromosome and plasmids) is located.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nStructure C is the main bacterial chromosome, which is a large, circular DNA molecule located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. It contains all the essential genetic information for the bacterium's growth, survival, and reproduction. Although it is the primary source of the bacterium's genes, it is not typically used as a vector in genetic modification because its large size and complexity make it difficult to isolate and manipulate compared to the much smaller and simpler plasmids."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_120.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "40 which statement about genetic modification is correct?\na_ it involves choosing which individual organisms are used for breeding.\nb_ it is always done using genes from the same species.\nc_ it produces a new combination of genes.\nd it produces exact copies of individual organisms.", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nGenetic modification, also known as genetic engineering, is a process that involves the direct manipulation of an organism's genome. This is typically achieved by taking a specific gene from one organism and inserting it into the DNA of another organism. This insertion results in a new sequence of DNA and, therefore, a new combination of genes that would not have occurred through natural reproductive processes. The resulting organism, often called a transgenic organism, possesses a modified set of genetic instructions, which can confer new traits, such as disease resistance or the ability to produce a specific protein.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A. It involves choosing which individual organisms are used for breeding.**\nThis statement describes the process of **selective breeding**, also known as artificial selection. Selective breeding is a traditional method where humans choose parent organisms with desirable characteristics and breed them together over many generations to enhance those traits in the offspring. This process works with the existing genetic variation within a species and does not involve the direct manipulation of DNA in a laboratory. Genetic modification, in contrast, operates at the molecular level to alter the genetic code itself.\n\n**B. It is always done using genes from the same species.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining feature of genetic modification is its ability to transfer genes between entirely different species, a process known as transgenesis. For example, the gene for producing insulin in humans has been inserted into bacteria to mass-produce insulin for treating diabetes. Similarly, genes from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) are inserted into crops like corn and cotton to provide them with resistance to insect pests. While it is possible to transfer genes within the same species (cisgenesis), genetic modification is not restricted to this and very often involves inter-species gene transfer.\n\n**D. It produces exact copies of individual organisms.**\nThis statement describes the process of **cloning**. Cloning is a method used to produce organisms that are genetically identical to a single parent organism. It creates a duplicate of an existing individual's entire genome.

Instead, it alters the genetic material of an organism, resulting in an individual that is genetically different from the original organism before modification."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_121.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "1. which process occurs both in plants and in animals?\na excretion\nb_ phagocytosis\nc photosynthesis\nd transpiration", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nExcretion is the process of removing metabolic waste products\u2014substances produced by chemical reactions within cells that are toxic or in excess\u2014from an organism. Both plants and animals carry out metabolic processes, such as respiration, and therefore both must excrete waste. In animals, waste products like carbon dioxide are excreted via the lungs, and urea is excreted by the kidneys in urine. In plants, waste products such as oxygen from photosynthesis and carbon dioxide from respiration are released through small pores called stomata. Therefore, excretion is a fundamental life process common to both kingdoms.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. phagocytosis:** Phagocytosis is the process by which a cell uses its plasma membrane to engulf a large solid particle. This is a common method of feeding for some single-celled organisms like *Amoeba* and a key mechanism for immune cells (phagocytes) in animals to destroy pathogens. However, plant cells possess a rigid cellulose cell wall outside their cell membrane, which prevents them from changing shape to engulf particles. Consequently, phagocytosis does not occur in plants.\n\n**C. photosynthesis:** Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy, by synthesising glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This process is characteristic of autotrophs, primarily plants, algae, and some bacteria. It requires the presence of chloroplasts and the pigment chlorophyll. Animal cells are heterotrophic and lack these structures, so they cannot perform photosynthesis and must obtain energy by consuming other organisms.\n\n**D. transpiration:** Transpiration is the specific process of water loss from a plant, primarily through the evaporation of water from the surfaces of leaves via the stomata. This process is essential for creating the transpiration stream, which pulls water and dissolved mineral ions up from the roots through the xylem.

For water to enter a cell, a water potential gradient must exist, with the water potential being higher in the solution outside the cell than in the cell's cytoplasm and vacuole. This gradient drives the passive movement of water into the cell until equilibrium is approached.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nA higher concentration of solutes corresponds to a lower water potential. If the concentration of solutes outside the cell is greater than inside the cell, it means the water potential outside the cell is lower than inside. According to the principles of osmosis, water moves down a water potential gradient (from high to low). Therefore, under these conditions, water would move out of the cell, not into it, causing the cell to lose turgor and potentially become plasmolysed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhen the concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell is equal, the water potential in both regions is also equal. This state is known as an isotonic condition. In this situation, there is no net water potential gradient across the cell membrane. While water molecules will continue to move across the membrane in both directions, the rate of movement into the cell will be equal to the rate of movement out of the cell. Consequently, there is no net entry of water by osmosis.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe net movement of water during osmosis always occurs from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. If the water potential inside the cell were higher than outside the cell, the water potential gradient would be directed from inside to outside.

This process requires a significant amount of energy.\n\n1.  **Respiration Rate:** A dormant seed has a very low metabolic rate and thus a very low rate of respiration. To initiate germination, the seed absorbs water, which activates enzymes. These enzymes break down stored food reserves (e.g., starch, lipids) into smaller, soluble molecules. These molecules are then used in aerobic respiration to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The processes of cell division (mitosis) and growth of the embryonic root (radicle) and shoot (plumule) are highly energy-dependent. Consequently, the **respiration rate increases** dramatically to supply the required energy.\n\n2.  **Amount of Energy Required:** As the seed begins to grow into a seedling, it undergoes rapid cell division, differentiation, and synthesis of new cellular components. These are all anabolic processes that require a substantial energy input. Therefore, the **amount of energy required increases** significantly compared to the dormant state.\n\n3.  **How Ions are Absorbed:** Once the radicle emerges and develops into a root system, it begins to absorb mineral ions from the soil. The concentration of these ions is often much higher inside the root hair cells than in the surrounding soil water. To move ions into the cells against this concentration gradient, the plant must expend energy. This process is known as **active transport**. The energy (ATP) required for active transport is supplied by the increased rate of respiration.\n\nTherefore, germination involves an increased respiration rate, an increased requirement for energy, and the absorption of ions via active transport.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because both the respiration rate and the amount of energy required increase during germination, they do not decrease. Germination is a transition from a low-energy, dormant state to a high-energy, active growth state.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect. While the amount of energy required does increase, the respiration rate also increases to meet this demand, it does not decrease. Furthermore, mineral ions are primarily absorbed by active transport, not diffusion, as this process moves them against their concentration gradient.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect. While the respiration rate correctly increases, the amount of energy required also increases to fuel the growth processes, it does not decrease.

The process of carbohydrate digestion is completed in the small intestine, breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars like glucose. The inner wall of the small intestine is lined with millions of tiny, finger-like projections called **villi** and even smaller **microvilli**. These structures vastly increase the surface area available for absorption. Glucose is absorbed from the lumen of the small intestine, across the epithelial cells of the villi, and directly into the dense network of blood capillaries within each villus, thereby entering the bloodstream.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A is incorrect.** This structure is the **stomach**. The main functions of the stomach are to store food, mix it with gastric juices, and begin the chemical digestion of proteins. Very little absorption of nutrients occurs in the stomach. Its thick mucous lining prevents significant absorption, although some water, alcohol, and certain medications can pass into the blood from here.\n\n*   **B is incorrect.** This structure is the **pancreas**. The pancreas is an accessory organ of the digestive system; food does not pass through it. It produces digestive enzymes that are released into the small intestine to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It also produces hormones, like insulin, that regulate blood glucose levels. However, it is not a site of nutrient absorption from digested food.\n\n*   **D is incorrect.** This structure is the **large intestine**.

This is based on the principle of complementary base pairing. In the DNA double helix, the nitrogenous bases pair in a highly specific manner: the purine base Guanine always pairs with the pyrimidine base Cytosine.

Both Guanine and Adenine are classified as purines, which are larger molecules with a double-ring structure. To maintain the constant diameter of the DNA double helix, a larger purine must always pair with a smaller pyrimidine (a single-ring base).

Maltose is a disaccharide, a sugar made of two glucose units. For it to be absorbed into the bloodstream, it must be broken down into its constituent monosaccharides (glucose). This chemical digestion is carried out by the enzyme maltase. Maltase is produced by the cells of the intestinal wall and is located on the surface of the microvilli (the brush border), as well as being present in the intestinal juice. Therefore, the small intestine is the specific site where maltose is digested into glucose, which is then absorbed.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. colon:** The colon is part of the large intestine. Its primary functions are the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and then to pass useless waste material from the body. The colon does not produce digestive enzymes, so no significant chemical digestion, including that of maltose, occurs here.\n\n**B. rectum:** The rectum is the terminal section of the large intestine, ending at the anus. Its function is to store faeces temporarily before they are eliminated from the body in a process called egestion. No digestion or absorption of nutrients takes place in the rectum.\n\n**D. stomach:** The stomach secretes hydrochloric acid, creating a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5), and the enzyme pepsin, which begins the chemical digestion of proteins. The stomach does not produce any enzymes that digest carbohydrates. Any salivary amylase that enters the stomach with the food bolus is denatured by the strong acid, halting carbohydrate digestion.

This leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the substrate and the enzyme's active site, resulting in a higher rate of reaction.\n2.  **Optimum Activity (at 30\u00b0C):** The enzyme exhibits its maximum activity at its optimum temperature, which is stated to be 30\u00b0C. At this point, the rate of successful enzyme-substrate complex formation is at its peak.\n3.  **Decreasing Activity (above 30\u00b0C):** At temperatures above the optimum, the enzyme begins to denature. The excessive thermal energy breaks the weak hydrogen bonds that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional shape. This alters the shape of the active site, so the substrate can no longer bind effectively. Consequently, the enzyme's activity decreases rapidly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis graph incorrectly shows that enzyme activity is at a minimum at 30\u00b0C and highest at very low and high temperatures. In reality, enzyme activity increases with temperature up to an optimum point. 30\u00b0C is the stated optimum temperature, so the activity should be at its maximum, not its minimum. Enzyme activity is typically very low at 0\u00b0C due to low kinetic energy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis graph incorrectly suggests a linear, directly proportional relationship where enzyme activity continues to increase indefinitely with temperature. While activity does increase with temperature initially, this model fails to show an optimum temperature. Crucially, it does not account for the process of denaturation, where high temperatures cause the enzyme's structure to break down, leading to a rapid decrease in activity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis graph correctly shows enzyme activity increasing up to the optimum temperature of 30\u00b0C. However, it incorrectly shows the activity remaining constant (plateauing) at temperatures above 30\u00b0C. Temperatures beyond the optimum cause the enzyme to denature, which changes the shape of the active site and leads to a sharp decline in activity, not a sustained maximum rate.

Since both necessary factors\u2014chlorophyll and light\u2014were present, photosynthesis took place, and starch was produced and stored in the cells of disc A.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nPhotosynthesis requires chlorophyll, the green pigment found in chloroplasts, to capture light energy. Disc B was taken from a white, non-pigmented area of the variegated leaf. This area lacks chlorophyll. Although this part of the leaf was exposed to light, photosynthesis could not proceed without the essential pigment to absorb that light energy. Therefore, no glucose or starch would be produced in the cells of disc B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nFor photosynthesis to occur, both chlorophyll and light are essential. Disc C was taken from a white area of the leaf, which means it lacks chlorophyll. Additionally, it was covered by black paper, which prevented light from reaching it.

Disc D was taken from a green area of the leaf, which contains chlorophyll. However, this section was covered by a piece of black paper, which blocked all light from reaching the leaf surface.

According to kinetic theory, as temperature increases, molecules gain kinetic energy and move more rapidly.

Furthermore, the increased energy means a higher proportion of these collisions are 'effective'\u2014they possess sufficient energy (activation energy) for a reaction to occur. Consequently, the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation increases, which in turn accelerates the overall rate of photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy, which is then stored in organic molecules like glucose. The statement suggests the opposite, which is biologically incorrect. Chlorophyll's role is to absorb light energy, not to convert chemical energy back into light.\n\n**B: Enzymes involved in photosynthesis have denatured.**\nDenaturation is the process where high temperatures cause an enzyme to lose its specific three-dimensional shape, particularly at the active site. This change is irreversible and results in a loss of function, leading to a rapid decrease in the rate of the reaction it catalyses. On the graph, denaturation is the reason for the decline in the rate of photosynthesis at temperatures above the optimum (approximately 25\u00b0C).

Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a crucial structural protein found in connective tissues throughout the body, including the skin, blood vessels, cartilage, and bones. Without sufficient vitamin C, the body cannot produce or maintain collagen properly. This leads to the breakdown of these tissues, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of scurvy, such as bleeding gums, poor wound healing, easy bruising, and joint pain.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. calcium:**\nA deficiency in calcium does not cause scurvy. Calcium is a mineral vital for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It is also essential for muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. A prolonged lack of calcium, often in conjunction with a vitamin D deficiency, can lead to conditions like rickets in children (softening and weakening of bones) and osteoporosis in adults (reduced bone density, making bones brittle).\n\n**B. iron:**\nAn iron deficiency does not lead to scurvy. Iron is a mineral that is a critical component of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. A lack of iron impairs the body's ability to produce enough healthy red blood cells, leading to a condition known as iron-deficiency anaemia. Symptoms of anaemia include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath due to reduced oxygen supply to tissues.\n\n**D. vitamin D:**\nA deficiency in vitamin D does not cause scurvy. The primary role of vitamin D is to facilitate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the small intestine, which is essential for the mineralisation and strengthening of bones.

This reduces the difference in water vapour concentration between the inside and the outside of the leaf.

High humidity indicates a high concentration of water vapour in the air surrounding the leaf. Since the air inside the leaf is also saturated with water vapour, this high external humidity *reduces* the difference between the internal and external concentrations. A smaller difference means a lower, or less steep, concentration gradient.

As water transpires, a layer of humid air, known as the boundary layer, forms around the stomata. Wind disperses this boundary layer, bringing drier air into contact with the leaf surface. This action increases the difference in water vapour concentration between the inside of the leaf and the outside air, thereby *raising* or steepening the concentration gradient, not lowering it.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, high humidity *lowers* the concentration gradient because the external air's water vapour concentration becomes closer to that inside the leaf.

The phloem is responsible for translocation, the process of transporting sugars (like sucrose) and amino acids from the leaves (the source) to other parts of the plant, such as the roots and storage organs (the sinks). This transport is typically in a downward direction from the leaves. By removing the phloem, the downward flow of these substances is blocked.

This high concentration of solutes lowers the water potential, drawing water from surrounding tissues via osmosis and resulting in the observed swelling.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B.** This statement is incorrect because phloem does not transport water and mineral ions. The transport of water and mineral ions from the roots to the rest of the plant occurs in the xylem tissue through the process of transpiration.

This blood is at a much lower pressure than the blood in arteries. To facilitate the flow of this low-pressure blood and reduce resistance, veins have a large internal cavity, known as the lumen. Furthermore, because the pressure is low, the walls of veins do not need to be as strong as those of arteries. Consequently, vein walls are relatively thin, with less muscle and elastic tissue.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Artery, large lumen, thick wall**\nThis description is incorrect. While arteries do have thick, muscular, and elastic walls to withstand the high pressure of blood pumped from the heart, they have a relatively narrow (small) lumen. A narrow lumen helps to maintain high blood pressure, ensuring efficient blood flow to all parts of the body. A large lumen would lead to a decrease in pressure.\n\n**B) Artery, small lumen, thin wall**\nThis description is incorrect. Although arteries correctly have a small lumen to maintain high pressure, they must have a thick wall. A thin wall would not be strong enough to withstand the high pressure and pulsatile flow of blood being ejected from the heart, and it would be at risk of rupturing.\n\n**D) Vein, small lumen, thick wall**\nThis description is incorrect as it describes the features of an artery, not a vein. Veins carry low-pressure blood and therefore have a large lumen to minimize resistance to flow and thin walls because they do not need to withstand high pressure.

This is correctly depicted by the arrow for Cl\u207b pointing from the cell to the gut. This movement of ions into the gut lumen significantly lowers the water potential of the fluid within the gut. As a result, water moves by osmosis down its water potential gradient, from the epithelial cells (an area of higher water potential) into the gut lumen (an area of lower water potential). This large volume of water moving into the gut leads to severe, watery diarrhoea. Diagram B correctly illustrates both the secretion of chloride ions and the subsequent osmotic movement of water into the gut.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis diagram shows both chloride ions (Cl\u207b) and water (H\u2082O) moving from the gut lumen into the small intestine epithelial cells. This process represents absorption, which is the normal function of the small intestine. However, the cholera toxin reverses this process, causing secretion into the gut, not absorption from it.

The diaphragm, a large dome-shaped muscle, returns to its relaxed, domed position, and the external intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, also relax.\n2.  **Stage 1: Rib cage moves downwards and inwards.** The relaxation of the external intercostal muscles allows the rib cage, under the force of gravity and elastic recoil, to fall downwards and inwards.\n3.  **Stage 2: Volume of thorax decreases and pressure in lungs increases.** The upward movement of the relaxed diaphragm and the downward and inward movement of the rib cage collectively reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity. According to Boyle's Law, a decrease in volume leads to an increase in pressure. Therefore, the air pressure inside the lungs (intrapulmonary pressure) becomes higher than the atmospheric pressure outside the body.\n4.  **Stage 3: Air is pushed out of lungs.** Gases move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Because the pressure inside the lungs is now greater than the atmospheric pressure, air is forced out of the lungs until the two pressures are equalised.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4**\nThis sequence is incorrect because it places muscle relaxation (4) as the final step.

The movement of air is driven by a pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is created by a change in volume.

They begin to respire anaerobically, breaking down glucose into lactic acid to produce a small amount of ATP. This accumulation of lactic acid leads to an \"oxygen debt,\" which is the extra oxygen the body needs after exercise to restore its normal state.\n\nThe lactic acid produced in the muscles diffuses into the bloodstream and is transported to the liver. In the liver, the lactic acid is metabolized. The majority of the lactic acid is converted back into glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis. This glucose can then be stored as glycogen in the liver or released back into the blood for use by other cells. A smaller portion of the lactic acid is aerobically respired in the liver to provide the ATP required for this conversion. This entire process, which primarily occurs in the liver, is crucial for removing lactic acid from the body and repaying the oxygen debt.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: brain**\nThe brain's primary fuel source is glucose. While it can use other substances like ketone bodies for energy under certain conditions, it is not the primary site for the metabolic clearance of lactic acid from the bloodstream. The brain's role is in neural control, not in processing the byproducts of muscle metabolism to repay a systemic oxygen debt.\n\n**B: heart**\nThe heart muscle is highly aerobic and can take up lactate from the blood and use it as a fuel source by converting it back to pyruvate and respiring it aerobically. However, the liver is the principal organ responsible for clearing the large quantities of lactic acid produced during intense exercise and converting it back to glucose. Therefore, while the heart contributes to lactate removal, the liver performs the main role in metabolizing lactate to resolve the overall oxygen debt.\n\n**D: lungs**\nThe lungs are the site of gas exchange, responsible for taking in oxygen from the atmosphere and releasing carbon dioxide from the blood. They supply the oxygen required for aerobic respiration throughout the body, including the oxygen needed by the liver to process lactic acid.

This action is controlled by an antagonistic pair of muscles in the iris: the circular muscles and the radial muscles. To reduce the size of the pupil, the circular muscles (also known as the sphincter pupillae) contract. Simultaneously, the opposing radial muscles (or dilator pupillae) must relax to allow the pupil to become smaller. This coordinated, involuntary action is known as the pupil reflex.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: The circular muscles of the iris contract and the radial muscles contract.**\nThe circular and radial muscles of the iris are an antagonistic pair, meaning they work in opposition to each other. The contraction of the circular muscles causes the pupil to constrict (get smaller), while the contraction of the radial muscles causes it to dilate (get wider). If both sets of muscles were to contract at the same time, they would pull against each other, resulting in an inefficient and ineffective response. This does not happen in a coordinated biological reflex.\n\n**C: The circular muscles of the iris relax and the radial muscles contract.**\nThis combination of muscle actions describes the pupil reflex in dim light, not bright light. In low light conditions, the pupil dilates (widens) to allow more light to enter the eye and reach the retina.

Auxin is synthesized in the apical meristem (the tip of the shoot) and promotes cell elongation in the region below the tip. When light shines on the shoot from one side, auxin migrates to the shaded side. This leads to a higher concentration of auxin on the shaded side of the shoot compared to the illuminated side. The greater concentration of auxin on the shaded side causes the cells in that region to elongate more rapidly. This differential rate of growth, where the shaded side grows faster than the lighted side, results in the shoot bending towards the light source. Diagram D correctly depicts this uneven distribution, with more auxin accumulating on the shaded side (the right side, as light comes from the left), which will cause the shoot to bend towards the light.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A:** This diagram illustrates an even distribution of auxin on both sides of the shoot. An even distribution of auxin would lead to equal rates of cell elongation on both the lighted and shaded sides of the shoot. Consequently, the shoot would grow straight upwards, showing vertical growth, rather than bending towards the light source. Bending is a result of differential growth, which requires an uneven distribution of the hormone.\n\n**B:** This diagram shows auxin being confined only to the very apex of the shoot tip. While auxin is produced in the apex, it must diffuse downwards to the zone of cell elongation just below the tip to have an effect on growth. If auxin remained only at the tip as shown, it would not reach the cells that are responsible for elongation, and therefore, no growth or bending response would be initiated.\n\n**C:** This diagram shows a higher concentration of auxin on the illuminated side of the shoot and a lower concentration on the shaded side. This is the opposite of the actual physiological response to unilateral light. If this distribution were to occur, the cells on the lighted side would elongate more rapidly than those on the shaded side. This would cause the shoot to bend away from the light source, a phenomenon known as negative phototropism, which is not the typical response for a plant shoot."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_147.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "27 what is an advantage of asexual reproduction in a wild population?\na_ the population has reduced ability to respond to changes in the environment.\nb_ the population can increase rapidly when conditions are suitable.\nc_ the population shows a lot of variation.\nd_ the whole population may be killed by a disease pathogen.", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nA key advantage of asexual reproduction is that it allows for rapid population growth.

The population has reduced ability to respond to changes in the environment.**\n    This statement describes a major *disadvantage* of asexual reproduction, not an advantage. Because asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent (clones), there is very little genetic variation within the population.

The gene responsible is located on the X chromosome. Let's denote the allele for normal vision as X^B (dominant) and the allele for colour blindness as X^b (recessive).\n\n1.  **Determine the Father's Genotype:** A man has one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Since he has red-green colour blindness, and the trait is recessive, his genotype must be **X^bY**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Mother's Genotype:** A woman has two X chromosomes (XX). She does not have red-green colour blindness, which means her phenotype is normal vision. This indicates she has at least one dominant allele (X^B). Her possible genotypes are therefore X^B X^B or X^B X^b.\n\n    However, the problem states that the couple has a child who is colour-blind. This child must have received a colour-blind allele (X^b) from each parent (if female, genotype X^bX^b) or from the mother (if male, genotype X^bY). In either scenario, the mother must possess the recessive allele (X^b). Since her phenotype is normal vision, she cannot be X^bX^b. Therefore, her genotype must be heterozygous: **X^B X^b**. She is a carrier of the trait.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability for the Next Child:** We can use a Punnett square to determine the probabilities of the genotypes for their next child from the cross between the carrier mother (X^B X^b) and the affected father (X^bY).\n\n| | **X^B** (from mother) | **X^b** (from mother) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **X^b** (from father) | X^B X^b (Carrier daughter) | X^b X^b (Affected daughter) |\n| **Y** (from father) | X^B Y (Unaffected son) | X^b Y (Affected son) |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see four possible outcomes, each with a 25% (1 in 4) probability:\n*   A daughter who is a carrier but has normal vision (X^B X^b).\n*   A daughter who has red-green colour blindness (X^b X^b).\n*   A son who has normal vision (X^B Y).\n*   A son who has red-green colour blindness (X^b Y).\n\nThe question asks for the probability that their next child will have red-green colour blindness. This includes both an affected daughter and an affected son.\nProbability = P(affected daughter) + P(affected son) = 25% + 25% = 50%.\n\nTherefore, there is a 50% probability that their next child will have red-green colour blindness. Each pregnancy is an independent event, so the outcome of the first child does not influence the probability for the next.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 0%**\nThis is incorrect. A 0% probability would imply that it is impossible for the couple to have a child with colour blindness. This would only be the case if the mother was homozygous dominant (X^B X^B), as she would only be able to pass on the allele for normal vision. However, the fact that their first child is colour-blind proves that the mother is a carrier (X^B X^b) and can pass on the recessive allele (X^b).\n\n**B: 25%**\nThis is incorrect. A 25% probability represents the chance of a single specific outcome from the Punnett square, such as having a colour-blind son (X^bY) or having a colour-blind daughter (X^bX^b). The question asks for the overall probability of having a colour-blind *child*, which requires combining the probabilities of all possible affected outcomes. In this case, the chance of an affected daughter (25%) and an affected son (25%) must be added together, resulting in a total probability of 50%.\n\n**D: 100%**\nThis is incorrect. A 100% probability would mean that every child is guaranteed to have colour blindness. For this to occur, all possible offspring genotypes would have to result in the colour-blind phenotype. This would require the mother to be colour-blind (X^bX^b). However, the problem explicitly states that the woman does not have red-green colour blindness. The Punnett square shows that there is a 50% chance of having a child with normal vision (X^B X^b or X^B Y)."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_153.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "33 which types of variation can be inherited?\n[sue | \u201ciomsoman\ngenes the environment\na v v key\nb v x v=yes\ncc x v x =no\nd x x", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nInheritance is the process of passing genetic information from parents to offspring. This genetic information is contained within genes, which are segments of DNA. Variation caused by genes, or genetic variation, refers to the differences in alleles (versions of a gene) that individuals possess. Since genes are passed on to the next generation through gametes (sperm and egg cells), any variation that has a genetic basis is heritable. Examples include blood type, natural hair colour, and inherited conditions such as sickle cell anaemia.\n\nVariation caused by the environment, on the other hand, refers to differences that arise due to external factors such as diet, climate, lifestyle, or accidents. These are known as acquired characteristics. For instance, a person may develop large muscles from weightlifting, or a plant may grow tall in nutrient-rich soil. These changes affect the individual's physical appearance (phenotype) but do not alter the genetic code in their gametes. Therefore, acquired characteristics are not passed on to offspring. This means that only variation caused by genes is inherited.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that both genetic and environmental variations can be inherited. While genetic variation is heritable, variation caused by the environment is not. Acquired characteristics, such as a scar from an injury or tanned skin from sun exposure, are not encoded in an organism's DNA and therefore cannot be passed on to the next generation through reproduction.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly claims that environmental variation is inherited while genetic variation is not. This is the opposite of the established principles of heredity. The entire basis of inheritance is the transmission of genes from one generation to the next. Environmental factors can influence how genes are expressed, but they do not alter the genes themselves in a way that can be inherited.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly suggests that no type of variation can be inherited. This contradicts the fundamental principles of genetics and evolution. The inheritance of genetic variation is the reason offspring resemble their parents and is the raw material upon which natural selection acts, leading to evolutionary change over time. Without the inheritance of genetic variation, life as we know it would not exist."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_154.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "34 which feature is a leaf adaptation for living in a hot, dry desert?\na hairy\nb large surface area\nc_ many stomata\nd thin waxy cuticle", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nHairy leaves are a key adaptation for plants, known as xerophytes, that live in hot, dry conditions. These hairs, or trichomes, trap a layer of still air close to the leaf's surface. This trapped air becomes saturated with water vapour that has transpired from the leaf, creating a humid microenvironment. The presence of this humid air reduces the water potential gradient between the moist interior of the leaf and the dry air outside. A lower water potential gradient slows the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata, thereby reducing the overall rate of transpiration and conserving precious water. Additionally, the light colour of the hairs can help to reflect excess sunlight, which keeps the leaf cooler and further reduces the rate of transpiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. large surface area**\nA large surface area is a disadvantage for a plant in a hot, dry desert. While a larger surface can increase the rate of photosynthesis by capturing more sunlight, it also significantly increases the rate of water loss through transpiration. To conserve water, desert plants typically have leaves with a very small surface area, or have their leaves modified into spines or needles. This minimizes the area exposed to the sun and dry air, thus reducing water loss.\n\n**C. many stomata**\nStomata are small pores on the leaf surface through which gas exchange and transpiration occur. A high number of stomata would provide more pathways for water vapour to escape the leaf, leading to a high rate of transpiration and rapid water loss. Plants adapted to dry environments (xerophytes) conserve water by having a reduced number of stomata. Furthermore, these stomata are often sunken into pits or grooves, which helps to trap moist air and reduce the water potential gradient, similar to the function of leaf hairs.\n\n**D. thin waxy cuticle**\nThe waxy cuticle is a waterproof layer covering the epidermis of the leaf. Its primary function is to prevent water from evaporating directly from the leaf's surface cells. In a hot, dry environment where water conservation is critical, a thick waxy cuticle is a vital adaptation. A thick cuticle provides a more effective barrier against water loss. A thin waxy cuticle would be ineffective at preventing water loss and is characteristic of plants living in environments with abundant water, not deserts."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_155.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "35 which term is used to describe an organism that makes its own organic nutrients?\na carnivore\nb  decomposer\nc herbivore\nd producer", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA producer, also known as an autotroph, is an organism that synthesizes its own organic nutrients from simple inorganic substances.

In an ecosystem where the producer is a large tree, the tree itself has a very large biomass. The total biomass of the primary consumers (e.g., insects) that feed on the tree is significantly less than the biomass of the tree. Subsequently, the biomass of secondary consumers is less than that of the primary consumers, and so on. This results in a classic, upright pyramid shape, as shown in diagram P.\n\nA pyramid of numbers illustrates the total number of individual organisms at each trophic level. In this specific food chain, the producer level consists of a single organism: one large tree. This one tree can support a very large number of primary consumers (e.g., thousands of insects).

Due to the inefficient transfer of energy between trophic levels (only about 10% is passed on), the total biomass at a lower trophic level must be greater than the biomass at the trophic level above it to be sustainable. Pyramid Q is inverted at its base, which is not a stable representation for a pyramid of biomass in a terrestrial ecosystem.\n\n**C: P = numbers, Q = biomass**\nThis option is incorrect because it reverses the correct representations. Pyramid P is upright, but a pyramid of numbers for a food chain starting with a single large tree would be inverted at its base (one tree supporting many herbivores). Pyramid Q is inverted, but a pyramid of biomass for this food chain would be upright, as the mass of one large tree is far greater than the mass of the organisms that feed on it.\n\n**D: P = numbers, Q = numbers**\nThis option is incorrect because a single food chain can only be represented by one pyramid of numbers, which will have a specific shape.

The extensive root systems of trees bind soil particles together, creating a stable and porous structure that can absorb and hold large amounts of rainwater. The forest canopy also intercepts precipitation, slowing the rate at which water reaches the ground.\n\nDeforestation removes this natural protection. Without trees, rainwater falls directly onto the exposed ground, often with significant force. This leads to soil compaction, which reduces its permeability and ability to absorb water. The absence of tree roots means the soil is less able to retain water. Consequently, a much larger proportion of rainfall becomes surface runoff, flowing rapidly into nearby rivers and streams. This sudden influx of water can overwhelm the capacity of the river channels, leading to a significant increase in the frequency and severity of flooding in downstream areas.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. decrease in land for livestock production**\n\nDeforestation is the large-scale removal of forests to make way for other land uses. One of the primary global drivers of deforestation is the expansion of agriculture, which includes both crop cultivation and livestock production (e.g., cattle ranching). Forests are cleared specifically to create more pastureland for grazing animals. Therefore, deforestation results in an *increase*, not a decrease, in the amount of land available for livestock production.\n\n**B. decreased levels of carbon dioxide in the air**\n\nTrees are vital components of the global carbon cycle. Through the process of photosynthesis, they absorb carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the atmosphere and store the carbon in their biomass (trunks, branches, leaves, and roots). Forests act as major carbon sinks, effectively removing CO\u2082 from the air. Deforestation has a dual negative effect: it eliminates trees that would otherwise absorb CO\u2082, and the common practice of burning cleared forests releases the stored carbon back into the atmosphere as CO\u2082. Both actions lead to an *increase* in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect and climate change.\n\n**D. increased levels of soil**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Deforestation leads to a significant *loss* of soil through erosion. The roots of trees and other forest vegetation anchor the soil, while the canopy protects it from the erosive forces of wind and rain. When forests are cleared, the topsoil is left exposed and vulnerable. Rainwater washes away the fertile topsoil, and wind can blow it away. This process, known as soil erosion, degrades the land and leads to a decrease in soil depth and quality. The eroded soil is often deposited in rivers and reservoirs, a process called siltation, which can further exacerbate flooding and harm aquatic ecosystems."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_158.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "38 the diagram shows the positions of four farms and the concentrations of nitrate at different points\nin a river.\nwhich farm is likely to have been using too much fertiliser on its land?\nfarm c\nco\ndirection \u2014z\nof flow rae a\n|\nfarm d\n|\nfarm b\ndirection \u2014=\nof flow\n60 preg bn re (pah ar 0 ea paes\na a gl cn\nsers be el |e ee ee be ee ee eee\nssr 2 | ee ee\nss 2 | ee ee\nsss | ee ee\nsese se el 8) ee oe ee ee eee\nsss 2 ee\nss 2\na0=feeeeeeeeeeeeeeee cbre eee eeeceeee cece eee eee ehec\n: sss | ee 2\nnitrate ss\n\u201c pep ee rere\nconcentration fefefeeeteeeeee etre ee e--eeee e+ abbbrre ee heee-ee-ee peele ee-ee eee\nppm ere ee eeeeeeeeee cbs -eeeeeeeehreerreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaeeeeeeeeteh\nsss | |\n7 eo |\npep ee a ee tr\nsss | es\nss | ee\npp ee ee re\nseg | es\nsss, 2s | es\nsrs ss | es\n[lettres | tt a rr ee rr ee\n0 2 el el el ee el 2 ee", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFertilisers used in agriculture contain high concentrations of minerals, including nitrates, to promote plant growth. When these fertilisers are used in excess, or when heavy rainfall occurs shortly after application, the surplus nitrates are not absorbed by the crops. Instead, they are washed off the land and transported into nearby rivers through processes known as surface runoff and leaching.\n\nThe bar chart shows the nitrate concentration at four different points. The second measurement point, located directly downstream from Farm A, corresponds to the highest measured nitrate concentration, approximately 58 parts per million (ppm). This is a substantial increase compared to the very low baseline concentration (approx. 2 ppm) measured upstream in the other river branch. Such a high concentration strongly indicates that a significant amount of nitrate-rich runoff has entered the river from Farm A's land, making it the most likely source of excessive fertiliser use.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe nitrate concentration in the river is measured both upstream and downstream of Farm B. The upstream concentration is very low (approx. 2 ppm), while the downstream concentration increases to approximately 32 ppm. Although this shows that Farm B is also a source of nitrate pollution, the concentration of 32 ppm is significantly lower than the 58 ppm measured downstream of Farm A. Therefore, while Farm B contributes to pollution, the evidence suggests that Farm A is responsible for a much larger discharge of nitrates, making it the more likely farm to be using *too much* fertiliser.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFarm C is situated on the upper river branch, downstream from Farm A. The water flowing past Farm C already contains a high concentration of nitrates originating from Farm A. The next available measurement point is after the two river branches have merged. At this point, the nitrate concentration is a result of the mixing of water from both branches, as well as any potential additional runoff from Farm C's land. Due to these combined factors, it is not possible to isolate the specific impact of Farm C from the data provided. The most significant and clearly identifiable source of pollution is Farm A, which causes the highest single concentration reading.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe direction of river flow is indicated by arrows pointing from left to right. Pollutants are carried downstream with the water current. The final measurement point shown on the diagram is located *upstream* of Farm D. This means the water was sampled *before* it reached the land belonging to Farm D.

The process involves transferring the genetic instructions for making a protein from one organism to another. Insulin is a protein, and the instructions for its synthesis are encoded in a gene, which is a specific length of DNA. To make human insulin, the gene for human insulin must be obtained from a human cell. This gene is then inserted into a bacterial plasmid, which acts as a vector to carry the gene into the bacterial cell. Once inside, the bacterium's cellular machinery reads the inserted human gene and synthesizes human insulin. Therefore, a length of DNA from a human, specifically the gene for insulin, is inserted into the plasmid.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B: a length of DNA from another bacterium**\nThis is incorrect because bacteria do not naturally produce human insulin. Their DNA contains genes for their own bacterial proteins, but not for the human insulin protein. Inserting DNA from another bacterium would not provide the genetic code necessary for the host bacterium to produce human insulin.\n\n**C: a molecule of insulin**\nThis is incorrect because insulin is the final protein product, not the genetic instruction. Genetic engineering works by inserting the gene (the DNA sequence) that codes for a protein into a host organism. The host organism's cells then use these genetic instructions to manufacture the protein. Inserting a molecule of the protein itself into a plasmid would not result in the production of more insulin, as the plasmid and the cell's replication and protein synthesis machinery work with DNA, not proteins.\n\n**D: an enzyme**\nThis is incorrect because while enzymes (specifically restriction enzymes and DNA ligase) are crucial tools used in the genetic engineering process to cut and paste DNA, they are not the genetic material that is inserted into the plasmid.

These products have distinct industrial applications.\n\n*   **Biofuel:** Ethanol is a type of alcohol that can be combusted to release energy. When produced from biological sources like the fermentation of sugars by yeast, it is known as bioethanol and serves as a renewable biofuel.\n*   **Bread:** In bread making, yeast is added to the dough. The yeast respires anaerobically, producing bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. These gas bubbles become trapped within the dough's gluten structure, causing it to expand and rise. This process, called leavening, is what gives bread its light, airy texture. The ethanol produced is a byproduct and largely evaporates during the baking process.\n\nTherefore, ethanol is the end-product used to make biofuel, and carbon dioxide is the end-product used to make bread rise.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because carbon dioxide is not used as a biofuel. Carbon dioxide is a gas at standard temperatures and pressures and does not release energy upon combustion in the way that ethanol does. While it is the correct product for making bread rise, its identification as a biofuel is incorrect.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for both applications. Carbon dioxide is not a biofuel. Furthermore, while ethanol is produced during bread making, it is the carbon dioxide gas that is responsible for leavening the dough, not the ethanol.\n\n**D:** This option correctly identifies ethanol as the product used for biofuel. However, it incorrectly states that ethanol is the product used for making bread. The essential product for causing bread to rise is carbon dioxide, which creates the gas pockets that give bread its structure. The ethanol is an incidental byproduct in this process."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_161.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "1. what are two characteristics of all living organisms?\na breathing and reproduction\nb_ photosynthesis and excretion\nc_ reproduction and respiration\nd_ respiration and photosynthesis", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nAll known living organisms exhibit a set of common characteristics. Two of the most fundamental of these are reproduction and respiration.\n\n*   **Reproduction** is the biological process by which new individual organisms \u2013 \"offspring\" \u2013 are produced from their \"parents\". While not essential for the survival of an individual organism, it is crucial for the continuation and survival of a species. All forms of life, from single-celled bacteria to multicellular plants and animals, reproduce.\n*   **Respiration** is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of all organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. This release of energy is essential to power all other life processes, including growth, movement, and repair.\n\nTherefore, reproduction and respiration are two characteristics shared by all living organisms.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. breathing and reproduction**\nThis option is incorrect because not all living organisms breathe. Breathing is the physical process of gas exchange, typically involving lungs or gills to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. However, many organisms, such as plants, fungi, and most microorganisms, do not have respiratory systems and do not \"breathe\". They exchange gases with their environment through other means, such as diffusion across cell surfaces or through pores like stomata. The universal process is cellular **respiration**, not the mechanical act of breathing.\n\n**B. photosynthesis and excretion**\nThis option is incorrect because not all living organisms perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria (autotrophs) to convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Organisms such as animals and fungi (heterotrophs) cannot make their own food and must obtain energy by consuming other organisms. While excretion is a universal characteristic, photosynthesis is not.\n\n**D. respiration and photosynthesis**\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as option B. While respiration is a universal life process, photosynthesis is restricted to autotrophic organisms. All living organisms respire to release energy from their food, but only producers photosynthesise to create that food initially. Animals, for example, respire but do not photosynthesise."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_162.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "2 the photograph shows an organism.\nif i a \u00bb = ~ <= <<}\n\u00bb = fy\nyi sg \u2018a\n\u2018 4 \u00e9s a \\ a \u2018a\nn (z rik y ee pt ' \\\n_ ] \u2018i . hi}\n-, mi\n= ~\n~*~\n2 a ma\nos rr, s jp.\na a \u00e9 ; if &\nxx sr \" os f yr\n1 oa jo ae a\n\u2018 3 \u2018 a \\ a\ned ees nan > \\ aa\n~? an y i\nwhich visible feature can be used to classify this organism as a bird?\na feathers\nb lays eggs\nc_ two legs\nd_ wings", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Explanation\n\n**A. feathers (Correct)**\n\nFeathers are a unique and defining characteristic of the class Aves (birds). They are complex epidermal structures found on all living birds and no other group of animals. This makes the presence of feathers the most reliable feature for identifying an organism as a bird.\n\n**B. lays eggs (Incorrect)**\n\nThe ability to lay eggs, known as oviparity, is not exclusive to birds. This reproductive method is also used by many other animal classes, including most reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects. Additionally, a small group of mammals, the monotremes (e.g., the platypus), also lay eggs. Therefore, egg-laying is not a definitive characteristic for classifying an organism as a bird.\n\n**C. two legs (Incorrect)**\n\nHaving two legs (bipedalism) is a feature shared by birds, but it is not unique to them. Humans, for example, are also bipedal animals. As this characteristic is present in other classes of animals, it cannot be used as the sole feature to classify an organism as a bird.\n\n**D. wings (Incorrect)**\n\nWhile wings are a prominent feature of most birds, they are not exclusive to this class. Other groups of animals, such as insects and bats (which are mammals), also possess wings. These structures are an example of convergent evolution, where different groups independently evolve similar features.

A defining feature of most bacteria is the presence of a cell wall, which lies outside the cell membrane. This rigid structure is primarily composed of peptidoglycan and serves several vital functions: it provides structural support, maintains the cell's characteristic shape (e.g., spherical, rod-like), and protects the cell from bursting due to osmotic pressure when in a hypotonic environment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. An animal cell has a cell wall.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Animal cells are eukaryotic cells that are distinguished by the absence of a cell wall. Their outermost boundary is the flexible cell membrane. This lack of a rigid external structure allows animal cells to have varied shapes and to carry out functions such as phagocytosis (engulfing particles). Cell walls are characteristic features of plant cells, fungi, and bacteria, not animals.\n\n**C. An animal cell has chloroplasts.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Chloroplasts are organelles responsible for photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy. Animals are heterotrophs, meaning they obtain energy by consuming other organisms rather than producing their own food. Consequently, animal cells do not contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are found in the cells of plants and algae, which are autotrophs.\n\n**D. A bacterium has chloroplasts.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bacteria are prokaryotes, which are structurally simpler than eukaryotes and lack membrane-bound organelles. Chloroplasts are complex, double-membraned organelles. Therefore, bacteria do not have chloroplasts. While some bacteria (like cyanobacteria) are capable of photosynthesis, they do so using chlorophyll and other pigments that are located in the cytoplasm or on infoldings of the cell membrane, not within organised chloroplasts."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_164.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "4 the diameter of an egg cell from a frog is 2.5mm.\nthe diameter of an egg cell from a human is 120 um.\nwhich value shows approximately how many times larger an egg cell from a frog is than an egg\ncell from a human?\na x2 b x21 c x48 d- x300", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nTo determine how many times larger a frog egg cell is than a human egg cell, we must first express both diameters in the same unit. The standard unit for microscopy is the micrometer (\u00b5m).\n\n1.  **Unit Conversion:** We know that 1 millimeter (mm) is equal to 1000 micrometers (\u00b5m). Therefore, we convert the diameter of the frog egg cell from millimeters to micrometers:\n    Diameter of frog egg = 2.5 mm \u00d7 1000 \u00b5m/mm = 2500 \u00b5m.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now that both diameters are in micrometers (frog egg = 2500 \u00b5m; human egg = 120 \u00b5m), we can find the ratio by dividing the larger diameter by the smaller diameter:\n    Ratio = (Diameter of frog egg) / (Diameter of human egg)\n    Ratio = 2500 \u00b5m / 120 \u00b5m \u2248 20.83\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value of 20.83 is approximately 21. Therefore, a frog egg cell is about 21 times larger in diameter than a human egg cell.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. \u00d72**\nThis value is incorrect. An answer of approximately \u00d72 would be obtained if an incorrect conversion factor was used. For example, if one mistakenly assumed that 1 mm = 100 \u00b5m, the calculation would be (2.5 \u00d7 100) / 120 = 250 / 120 \u2248 2.08, which rounds to 2. The correct conversion is 1 mm = 1000 \u00b5m.\n\n**C. \u00d748**\nThis value is incorrect. This result is obtained by dividing the numerical value of the human egg diameter by the numerical value of the frog egg diameter (120 / 2.5 = 48) without first converting them to the same unit. This calculation is mathematically and conceptually flawed because it compares values with different units (\u00b5m and mm).\n\n**D. \u00d7300**\nThis value is incorrect.

The cytoplasm and cell sap inside a plant cell contain solutes such as salts and sugars, which results in a lower water potential compared to pure water. Pure water has the highest possible water potential (defined as zero).\n\nWhen a plant cell is placed in pure water, a water potential gradient is established. Water moves by osmosis from the surrounding pure water (higher water potential) into the cell's vacuole and cytoplasm (lower water potential). Therefore, the cell **gains** water.\n\nAs water enters the cell, the vacuole swells and pushes the cell contents against the rigid cellulose cell wall. This creates internal pressure, known as turgor pressure, which makes the cell firm and swollen. This state is described as **turgid**. The strong cell wall prevents the cell from bursting.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: gains, plasmolysed**\nWhile it is correct that the cell gains water, it does not become plasmolysed. Plasmolysis is the process where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to significant water loss, which occurs when a plant cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential (a concentrated solution).\n\n**C: loses, plasmolysed**\nA plant cell only loses water when placed in a solution with a lower water potential than its own cytoplasm (a hypertonic solution). Pure water has a higher water potential, so the cell will gain, not lose, water. Although water loss does cause plasmolysis, the initial premise that the cell loses water is incorrect in this scenario.\n\n**D: loses, turgid**\nThis option is contradictory. A plant cell loses water when the external solution has a lower water potential, which leads to it becoming flaccid or plasmolysed. A cell becomes turgid by gaining water, not losing it.

Glucose enters the cells by both active transport and diffusion.**\n\n*   The graph shows that some glucose is taken up by the cells even in the absence of oxygen. This uptake does not require energy from aerobic respiration and is therefore a passive process, which for glucose is facilitated diffusion. Diffusion allows substances to move down a concentration gradient without the expenditure of metabolic energy (ATP).\n*   The graph also shows that in the presence of oxygen, the rate and total amount of glucose uptake are significantly higher. Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, a process that generates a large amount of ATP. This ATP provides the energy for active transport, which can move glucose into the cells against its concentration gradient.\n*   Therefore, the data indicates two mechanisms are at work: diffusion, which occurs with or without oxygen, and active transport, which is significantly enhanced by the presence of oxygen due to increased ATP production.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Glucose only enters the cells by active transport.**\nThis conclusion is incorrect because the graph clearly shows that glucose uptake occurs even when there is no oxygen. Active transport is an energy-intensive process that requires ATP, which is primarily produced during aerobic respiration (which needs oxygen). In the absence of oxygen, ATP production is very low, so active transport would be severely limited. The fact that uptake still happens indicates that a process not dependent on aerobic respiration, such as diffusion, must also be involved.\n\n**B. Glucose only enters the cells by diffusion.**\nThis conclusion is incorrect because it cannot explain the large difference in glucose uptake between the \"with oxygen\" and \"no oxygen\" conditions. Diffusion is a passive process that does not require ATP. If diffusion were the only method of uptake, the presence of oxygen (and the resulting high levels of ATP) would not cause such a dramatic increase in the rate and total amount of glucose entering the cells. The enhanced uptake with oxygen points to an additional, energy-dependent mechanism.\n\n**D. Glucose enters the cells by osmosis.**\nThis statement is biologically incorrect. Osmosis is specifically defined as the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.

The enzyme and substrate have more kinetic energy and collide more frequently.**\n\nThis statement correctly explains why the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction increases with temperature, up to the optimum. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. As the temperature rises, both the enzyme and substrate molecules gain more kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and randomly. This increased speed leads to a higher frequency of collisions between the substrate molecules and the active sites of the enzyme molecules. A greater number of collisions per unit of time results in the formation of more enzyme-substrate complexes, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The enzyme and substrate have more kinetic energy and collide less frequently.**\n\nThis statement is partially correct but ultimately flawed. While it is true that an increase in temperature provides the enzyme and substrate with more kinetic energy, this leads to an *increase*, not a decrease, in collision frequency. Molecules with higher kinetic energy move faster, making collisions between them more likely.\n\n**B. The enzyme and substrate have less kinetic energy and collide more frequently.**\n\nThis statement contains a contradiction. An increase in temperature leads to an *increase* in the kinetic energy of molecules, not a decrease. While more frequent collisions do increase the reaction rate, this is a consequence of higher, not lower, kinetic energy.\n\n**D. The enzyme and substrate have less kinetic energy and collide less frequently.**\n\nThis statement describes the effect of *decreasing* the temperature.

The product of photosynthesis, glucose, is often stored as starch. This experiment is designed to test the necessity of light and chlorophyll. The plant was first destarched, meaning any starch present at the end of the experiment must have been produced during the 24-hour period of light exposure.\n\nRegion C is part of the green central area of the leaf, which contains chlorophyll. It was also exposed to light. Since all the necessary conditions for photosynthesis were met in this region, glucose was produced and subsequently converted to starch for storage. Therefore, a positive test for starch would be observed in region C.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nRegion A is located in the white outer part of the variegated leaf. The white colour indicates the absence of chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for absorbing light energy. Although this region was exposed to light, photosynthesis could not take place without chlorophyll. As a result, no glucose was synthesised, and consequently, no starch was produced or stored in this area.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nRegion B is located in the green central part of the leaf, meaning it contains chlorophyll. However, this region was covered by black paper, which prevented light from reaching the leaf cells. Light is the essential energy source that drives the process of photosynthesis. In the absence of light, photosynthesis cannot occur, even with chlorophyll present. Therefore, no glucose was produced, and no starch was stored in region B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nRegion D, similar to region A, is situated in the white, non-pigmented outer area of the leaf. This part of the leaf lacks chlorophyll, which is essential for capturing light energy for photosynthesis.

Light is in excess, and therefore it is not limiting the process.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as option C. The section between points 3 and 4 is part of the light saturation plateau where the rate of photosynthesis is constant. An increase in light intensity in this region does not cause an increase in the rate.

This energy is captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the process of cellular respiration.\n*   **Carbohydrates** are the body's primary and most readily available source of energy. They are digested into simple sugars, mainly glucose. Glucose is the key substrate for aerobic respiration, where it is completely oxidized in the presence of oxygen to produce a significant amount of ATP, water, and carbon dioxide.\n*   **Fats (lipids)** are the body's most concentrated energy source and are used for long-term energy storage. When required, fats are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids. These components can then enter the cellular respiration pathway at different points to generate a large quantity of ATP, even more per gram than carbohydrates.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. carbohydrate and mineral ions:** While carbohydrates are a primary energy source, mineral ions are not. Mineral ions are inorganic elements (e.g., calcium, iron, potassium) that are essential for various bodily functions, such as nerve impulse transmission, bone formation, and acting as cofactors for enzymes. They do not contain chemical energy that can be released through metabolic processes.\n\n**C. protein and water:** Water is an essential inorganic compound vital for life, acting as a solvent, a transport medium, and a reactant in hydrolysis. However, it is not a source of metabolic energy. While proteins can be broken down into amino acids and used to release energy, this is not their primary function; they are mainly used for growth, repair, and synthesis of enzymes and hormones. The body typically uses proteins for energy only when carbohydrate and fat reserves are depleted. The inclusion of water, a non-energy component, makes this option incorrect.\n\n**D. vitamins and protein:** Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for various metabolic processes, often functioning as coenzymes that help enzymes work correctly. They are crucial for health but are not broken down to release energy. Although proteins can be used as an energy source, the inclusion of vitamins, which are non-caloric, makes this option incorrect."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_174.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "14 which is a part of the small intestine?\na colon\nb_ ileum\nc oesophagus\nd- rectum", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B. ileum\n\nThe small intestine is a long, coiled tube in the digestive system responsible for the chemical digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.

Translocation is the transport of soluble organic substances, such as sugars, from a source to a sink via the phloem.\n\n1.  **Correct Substance:** The primary sugar transported in the phloem is sucrose. While glucose is produced during photosynthesis, it is converted into sucrose for transport because sucrose is a non-reducing sugar, making it less chemically reactive and more stable for long-distance travel within the plant. This diagram correctly labels the transported substance as sucrose.\n2.  **Correct Source and Sink:** A 'source' is an area of the plant where sugars are produced (e.g., a photosynthesizing leaf) or released from storage. A 'sink' is an area where sugars are used for growth or stored (e.g., roots, fruits, or developing buds). The diagram correctly shows the substance moving from a source cell into the phloem.\n3.  **Correct Direction of Movement:** Sugars are actively loaded from source cells into the phloem sieve tubes. The high concentration of sugar in the phloem draws water in by osmosis, creating high pressure that drives the bulk flow of the sugar solution. At the sink, sugars are actively unloaded from the phloem. This diagram correctly illustrates the loading of sucrose from the source into the phloem and the unloading from the phloem into the sink.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it identifies the transported sugar as glucose. Although glucose is the direct product of photosynthesis, it is typically converted to sucrose for transport within the phloem. Sucrose is a disaccharide and is less reactive than the monosaccharide glucose, making it a more suitable molecule for long-distance transport through the plant's vascular system without being metabolized along the way. While the source-to-sink direction is correctly depicted, the identity of the transported sugar is wrong.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis diagram contains two significant errors. Firstly, like diagram A, it incorrectly identifies the transported substance as glucose instead of sucrose. Secondly, it incorrectly labels the source and sink relative to the direction of transport shown. The dotted arrow indicates a downward flow of substances within the phloem. This means the substance must be loaded into the phloem at a higher point (the source) and unloaded at a lower point (the sink). The diagram incorrectly labels the upper cell as the sink and the lower cell as the source, which contradicts the direction of movement.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it mislabels the source and the sink. The process of translocation involves the movement of sugars from a source to a sink. The dotted arrow in the phloem indicates the overall direction of flow is downwards. Therefore, the source (where sugar is loaded) must be the upper cell, and the sink (where sugar is unloaded) must be the lower cell. This diagram reverses these labels, incorrectly showing the upper cell as the sink and the lower cell as the source. Although it correctly identifies sucrose as the transported sugar, the fundamental representation of the transport process is flawed."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_177.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "17 the diagram shows a section of the human heart.\nwhich label identifies the right ventricle?\n\\/\na\nd cc", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\n*   **Explanation for D (Correct):**\n    This label indicates the right ventricle.

To determine the correct order, we must first identify each blood vessel by its structure.\n\n*   **Vessel 1** has a thick, muscular and elastic wall with a relatively narrow central channel (lumen). This structure is characteristic of an **artery** (or a smaller arteriole), which must withstand and maintain the high pressure of blood being pumped from the heart.\n*   **Vessel 3** has a wall that is only one cell thick.

This structure is characteristic of a **vein**, which carries blood back to the heart under low pressure. The larger lumen reduces resistance to blood flow.\n\nBlood leaves the aorta (the body's main artery) and travels through progressively smaller arteries (like vessel 1).

This pathogen carries specific molecules on its surface called **antigens** (1), which are recognized as foreign by the immune system.

These cells proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, which produce large quantities of specific proteins called **antibodies** (2). These antibodies bind to the antigens, marking the pathogen for destruction.

Passive immunity is the transfer of pre-made antibodies into an individual, providing immediate but temporary protection without stimulating the individual's own immune system to produce memory cells.

The external intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, contract, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards. The internal intercostal muscles, which are an antagonistic pair to the external ones, must relax to allow this movement to occur. This expansion of the rib cage, along with the contraction and flattening of the diaphragm, increases the volume within the chest. This increase in volume causes a decrease in pressure inside the lungs relative to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. As a result, air flows from the higher external pressure to the lower internal pressure, filling the lungs.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The external intercostal muscles and the internal intercostal muscles contract.**\nThis is incorrect because the external and internal intercostal muscles are an antagonistic muscle pair, meaning they work in opposition to each other. They cannot both contract at the same time. The contraction of external intercostals facilitates inhalation, while the contraction of internal intercostals facilitates forced exhalation. Simultaneous contraction would lead to a rigid chest wall, preventing the volume change required for breathing.\n\n**B. The external intercostal muscles and the internal intercostal muscles relax.**\nThis describes the state of the intercostal muscles during passive exhalation (breathing out), not inhalation. Inhalation is an active process requiring the contraction of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. When these muscles relax, the volume of the thoracic cavity decreases, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. Therefore, the relaxation of these key muscles is characteristic of breathing out, not in.\n\n**C. The external intercostal muscles relax and the internal intercostal muscles contract.**\nThis combination of muscle actions occurs during forced exhalation, such as when coughing or during strenuous exercise. The contraction of the internal intercostal muscles pulls the rib cage down and inwards, while the relaxation of the external intercostals allows this to happen. This action rapidly decreases the thoracic volume, increasing the pressure inside the lungs and forcefully expelling air.

Initially, as the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of both the enzyme and substrate molecules increases. This leads to more frequent and energetic collisions, resulting in a higher rate of reaction. The activity continues to rise until it reaches a peak at the enzyme's **optimum temperature**, where the rate of reaction is maximal. Beyond this point, a further increase in temperature causes the weak hydrogen bonds holding the enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure to break. This process, known as **denaturation**, alters the shape of the active site, making it no longer complementary to the substrate. Consequently, the enzyme's activity rapidly decreases and eventually ceases.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\nThis graph is incorrect because it shows enzyme activity increasing to a maximum and then plateauing, remaining constant at higher temperatures. This pattern is characteristic of the effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activity, where the rate becomes constant once all enzyme active sites are saturated. However, for temperature, activity does not remain high. Instead, high temperatures cause the enzyme to denature, leading to a sharp drop in activity, which is not depicted in this graph.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\nThis graph incorrectly suggests a linear and directly proportional relationship between temperature and enzyme activity, implying that activity would increase indefinitely as temperature rises. While enzyme activity does increase with temperature initially, this relationship is not linear and is limited. This model fails to account for the existence of an optimum temperature and, critically, ignores the process of denaturation, where high temperatures cause a rapid and irreversible loss of enzyme function.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\nThis graph incorrectly shows an exponential increase in enzyme activity with temperature, with no upper limit. While the rate of reaction does increase with temperature up to a certain point, it does not continue to accelerate indefinitely.

The brain interprets the relative stimulation of these three types of cones to perceive a wide range of colours.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. Rod cells are far more sensitive to light than cone cells.

While it is true that cone cells are concentrated in the fovea (statement 1) and detect colour (statement 2), they are less sensitive to light than rod cells. Rod cells are specialised for vision in dim light due to their high light sensitivity.\n\n**C. 1 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false. Although statement 1 correctly describes the location of cone cells, statement 3 incorrectly claims that cones are more sensitive to light than rods. Rod cells are the more light-sensitive photoreceptors, adapted for low-light vision.\n\n**D. 2 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because statement 3 is false.

A key function of the skin in thermoregulation is controlling heat loss from the blood. When the body needs to conserve heat (in cold conditions), the smooth muscle in the walls of these arterioles contracts. This process, known as vasoconstriction, narrows the lumen (the inside space) of the blood vessel. As a result, the volume of warm blood flowing to the skin surface is significantly reduced, which in turn decreases the amount of heat lost to the surrounding environment by radiation.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. Sensory Receptor:**\nStructure A is a sensory receptor, likely a Meissner's corpuscle, which is sensitive to light touch. While sensory receptors in the skin are responsible for detecting temperature changes in the external environment and sending signals to the brain, they do not themselves constrict or directly participate in the physiological response to reduce heat loss. Their role is detection, not response.\n\n**C. Arrector Pili Muscle:**\nStructure C is the arrector pili muscle, a small muscle attached to a hair follicle. In response to cold, this muscle contracts, causing the hair to stand on end. In animals with dense fur, this traps a layer of air close to the skin, which acts as an insulator to reduce heat loss. In humans, this response is vestigial and creates \"goosebumps,\" but it is not an effective mechanism for reducing heat loss. The primary mechanism is the constriction of blood vessels (B).\n\n**D. Sweat Gland:**\nStructure D is a sweat gland, which is involved in cooling the body down, not conserving heat. When the body temperature rises, the sweat gland secretes sweat onto the skin's surface. The evaporation of this sweat requires thermal energy, which it takes from the skin, thereby producing a cooling effect and increasing heat loss. To reduce heat loss in cold conditions, sweat production is stopped, but the gland itself does not constrict."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_187.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "27 where are the hormones oestrogen and progesterone produced during pregnancy?\na amniotic sac\nb_ oviducts\nc placenta\nd_ umbilical cord", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: C. placenta**\n\nThe placenta is a temporary endocrine organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy. In the early stages of pregnancy, the corpus luteum in the ovary produces progesterone and oestrogen. However, as the placenta matures (by about the 8th-12th week), it takes over as the primary producer of these crucial hormones. Progesterone maintains the uterine lining (endometrium), preventing menstruation, and inhibits uterine contractions to sustain the pregnancy. Oestrogen supports the development of the fetus, stimulates the growth of the uterus, and prepares the mammary glands for lactation.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. amniotic sac**\nThe amniotic sac is a membrane that encloses the developing fetus and contains amniotic fluid. Its primary functions are to protect the fetus from physical injury, maintain a constant temperature, and allow for fetal movement. The amniotic sac is not an endocrine tissue and does not produce hormones like oestrogen and progesterone.\n\n**B. oviducts**\nThe oviducts, also known as Fallopian tubes, are the site where fertilisation typically occurs.

The oviducts are not endocrine glands and are not responsible for producing the high levels of oestrogen and progesterone required to maintain pregnancy.\n\n**D. umbilical cord**\nThe umbilical cord connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains blood vessels that facilitate the transport of nutrients, oxygen, and antibodies from the mother's blood (via the placenta) to the fetus, and the removal of waste products, such as carbon dioxide and urea, from the fetus to the placenta.

The fetus, like any living organism, undergoes cellular respiration, a process that consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. Fetal metabolism also produces other excretory wastes, such as urea. These waste products must be removed from the fetal blood. The placenta facilitates the transfer of these wastes to the mother's circulatory system for disposal. Consequently, the blood traveling from the fetus in the umbilical artery is high in carbon dioxide and urea, and low in oxygen (as it has been used by the fetus).\n\nIn contrast, the umbilical vein carries blood from the placenta back to the fetus.

This composition describes the blood in the umbilical vein, which carries oxygenated and purified blood from the placenta to the fetus, not the blood in the umbilical artery.\n\n**B:** This option correctly identifies that the umbilical artery has less oxygen and more urea, but it incorrectly states that it has less carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a primary waste product of fetal cellular respiration that is transported to the placenta for removal. Therefore, its concentration is higher in the umbilical artery than in the umbilical vein.\n\n**C:** This option correctly identifies that the umbilical artery has more carbon dioxide, but it incorrectly states that it has more oxygen and less urea.

The condition is recessive, meaning an individual must have the genotype X^a X^a (female) or X^a Y (male) to express the phenotype.\n\nTo determine the chances of their daughter showing the condition, we must consider the possible gametes and resulting offspring genotypes.\n\n*   The mother (X^A X^a) can produce two types of eggs: 50% with the X^A allele and 50% with the X^a allele.\n*   The father (X^a Y) can produce two types of sperm: 50% with the X^a allele and 50% with the Y chromosome.\n\nA daughter is formed when a sperm carrying an X chromosome fertilises an egg.

However, the question specifically asks for the chances that *their daughter* will have the condition, which means we only consider the female offspring possibilities.\n\n**D) 75%**\nThis is incorrect. Based on the principles of Mendelian genetics for this specific cross, there is no combination of alleles that would result in a 75% probability of a daughter showing the recessive condition.

Variation is a fundamental concept in evolution, as it provides the raw material upon which natural selection acts.\n\n---\n**A. having two identical alleles of a particular gene**\n\nThis describes the genetic state known as **homozygous**. An allele is a specific version of a gene.

This structural adaptation is crucial for water conservation. Rolling the leaf encloses the stomata within a protected, internal space. The hairs further contribute by trapping a layer of still, humid air around the stomata. This trapped humid air reduces the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside environment, significantly decreasing the rate of water loss through transpiration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: large air spaces in the tissues**\nThis is a characteristic feature of hydrophytes (aquatic plants), not xerophytes. Large air spaces, known as aerenchyma, provide buoyancy to keep the leaves and stems afloat for optimal sunlight exposure and facilitate the diffusion of gases like oxygen to submerged parts of the plant. Xerophytes, in contrast, typically have dense, compact tissues to minimise internal water loss.\n\n**C: leaves with stomata on the upper surface**\nThis is an adaptation found in floating hydrophytes, such as water lilies. Their leaves float on the water's surface, so stomata must be on the upper epidermis to allow for gas exchange with the atmosphere.

Producers, such as plants and algae, capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This chemical energy is stored in the bonds of organic molecules (like glucose). When a primary consumer eats a producer, this stored chemical energy is transferred. The energy continues to flow through the subsequent trophic levels of the food chain as organisms are consumed. Therefore, the energy transfer at every step in a food chain can be traced back to the initial input of solar energy.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. producer**\nA producer is an organism, typically a plant or alga, that forms the base of a food chain. While producers are the first organisms to introduce energy into the food chain, they do not create this energy.

In a forest ecosystem, the producers at the first trophic level are large trees. These trees have a very large combined biomass, forming a wide base for the pyramid. The primary consumers (herbivores like insects, squirrels, and deer) that feed on these trees have a significantly smaller total biomass. Subsequently, the secondary consumers (carnivores that eat herbivores) and tertiary consumers have progressively smaller total biomass at each higher trophic level. This is because only about 10% of the energy, and thus biomass, is transferred from one trophic level to the next. Therefore, a pyramid of biomass for a forest is always upright, with the largest biomass at the bottom and decreasing at each successive level.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis diagram shows a spindle-shaped pyramid, where the producer level is narrow, the primary consumer level is wide, and the higher trophic levels become narrow again. This shape is characteristic of a **pyramid of numbers** for a forest ecosystem, not a pyramid of biomass.

This type of pyramid of biomass is characteristic of certain aquatic ecosystems, such as oceans or lakes. In these environments, the producers are microscopic phytoplankton. While their individual mass is tiny, they reproduce very rapidly. This high turnover rate allows a small standing crop (total biomass at any one time) of phytoplankton to support a much larger biomass of primary consumers (zooplankton).

It shows the biomass of secondary consumers being greater than the biomass of primary consumers. According to the principles of energy flow in an ecosystem, energy is lost at each trophic level, primarily as heat during metabolic processes. Typically, only about 10% of the energy from one level is incorporated into the biomass of the next. Consequently, the total biomass must decrease at each successive trophic level.

The over-use of fertilisers on agricultural land is a primary source of these nutrients. When rain washes these excess fertilisers, which are rich in nitrates and phosphates, into rivers, it stimulates a rapid and excessive growth of aquatic plants and algae (an algal bloom). When these plants die, they provide a large amount of organic matter for decomposer bacteria. The population of these aerobic bacteria increases dramatically, and their respiratory activity consumes large quantities of dissolved oxygen in the water. This severe depletion of oxygen (hypoxia) leads to the death of fish and other aquatic animals that require oxygen for survival.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Air pollution**\nAir pollution, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels which releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can lead to the formation of acid rain. Acid rain lowers the pH of rivers and lakes, making the water acidic. This change in acidity can directly harm or kill aquatic organisms, including fish, by damaging their gills and disrupting their life cycles. However, it does not typically cause the initial rapid growth of aquatic plants that is a key step in the process of eutrophication.\n\n**B. Deforestation**\nDeforestation, the clearing of forests, often leads to increased soil erosion. Without tree roots to hold the soil in place, large amounts of soil and sediment are washed into rivers. This increases the turbidity (cloudiness) of the water, which blocks sunlight from reaching submerged aquatic plants. The reduction in light penetration inhibits photosynthesis and can cause these plants to die, rather than promoting their rapid growth.\n\n**D. Presence of herbicides**\nHerbicides are chemicals specifically designed to kill unwanted plants. If herbicides from agricultural land were to wash into a river, they would be toxic to the aquatic plants, causing them to die off.

The process of producing human insulin in bacteria involves genetic engineering. The gene for human insulin is first isolated from human DNA. This gene is then inserted into a plasmid, which is a small, circular piece of DNA obtained from a bacterium. The resulting plasmid, now containing DNA from two different sources (human and bacterium), is called a recombinant plasmid. This recombinant plasmid is then introduced into host bacterial cells. The bacteria's cellular machinery reads the instructions on the recombinant plasmid and synthesizes human insulin.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A. a human nucleus:** This is incorrect. A human nucleus contains the entire set of human chromosomes, which is far more genetic information than is needed. Only the specific gene for producing insulin is required for this process. Furthermore, a bacterial cell is a simple prokaryote and cannot incorporate a large, complex eukaryotic organelle like a nucleus.\n\n*   **B. human plasmids:** This is incorrect. Plasmids are small DNA molecules that are naturally found in bacteria, not in human cells. The plasmids used in this process are of bacterial origin. While they are modified to carry a human gene, they are not \"human plasmids.\"\n\n*   **C. recombinant insulin:** This is incorrect. Insulin is the protein that is the final product of this process. The goal is to make the bacterial cells produce insulin. To do this, the genetic instructions (the gene) for making insulin must be inserted into the bacteria, not the insulin protein itself. The term \"recombinant insulin\" refers to the insulin produced through this genetic engineering method, but it is the product, not the material inserted into the bacteria to start the process."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_200.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "40 penicillin is made in a fermenter by growing organisms.\nwhich type of organism is used in the production of penicillin?\na bacterium\nb_ fungus\nc protoctist\nd virus", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nPenicillin is an antibiotic produced by a fungus. Specifically, it is synthesised by certain species of mould belonging to the genus *Penicillium*, most notably *Penicillium chrysogenum*. In industrial production, this fungus is cultured in large vessels called fermenters. Within the fermenter, conditions such as nutrient supply, pH, temperature, and oxygen levels are meticulously controlled to encourage the fungus to grow and produce the maximum amount of penicillin. The fungus secretes penicillin into the surrounding liquid medium, from which it is later extracted and purified.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) bacterium:**\nThis is incorrect because bacteria are the target of penicillin, not the producers. Penicillin is an antibiotic that functions by inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. This weakens the cell wall, causing the bacterium to lyse (burst) and die. While some other antibiotics are produced by bacteria (e.g., streptomycin from *Streptomyces*), penicillin is of fungal origin.\n\n**C) protoctist:**\nThis is incorrect. The Kingdom Protoctista includes a wide variety of simple eukaryotic organisms, such as algae and amoebas. The organism *Penicillium* is classified under the Kingdom Fungi, not Protoctista. Fungi have distinct features, such as cell walls made of chitin and a saprotrophic mode of nutrition, which separate them from protoctists. Therefore, a protoctist is not the organism used to produce penicillin.\n\n**D) virus:**\nThis is incorrect. Viruses are non-cellular entities that are not capable of independent metabolism or reproduction. They are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they must infect a living host cell and use its cellular machinery to replicate. Viruses lack the complex metabolic pathways and organelles required to synthesise molecules like penicillin. Furthermore, antibiotics are ineffective against viruses because viruses do not have cell walls or the metabolic processes that these drugs target."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_201.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "1 apperson touches a hot object and rapidly moves their hand away from the hot object.\nwhich characteristic of living organisms is this an example of?\na excretion\nb growth\nc_ reproduction\nd _ sensitivity", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nSensitivity, also known as irritability, is the ability of a living organism to detect changes or stimuli in its internal or external environment and make appropriate responses. In this scenario, the hot object acts as an external stimulus. Sensory receptors in the person's skin detect the potentially harmful high temperature. The nervous system rapidly processes this information and initiates a response: the contraction of muscles to pull the hand away.

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.\n\n1.  **In distilled water:** Distilled water has the highest possible water potential (0 kPa). The cytoplasm of a plant cell contains solutes, giving it a lower (more negative) water potential. Due to this water potential gradient, water moves by osmosis from the distilled water into the plant cell. The cell swells, and the cell membrane pushes against the inelastic cell wall, causing the cell to become firm and **turgid**.\n\n2.  **In the low concentration sucrose solution:** The problem states that this solution has a higher water potential than the plant cell cytoplasm. This creates a water potential gradient where water will move by osmosis from the solution into the cell. As in distilled water, the cell will take in water and become **turgid**.\n\n3.  **In the high concentration sucrose solution:** The problem states that this solution has a lower water potential than the plant cell cytoplasm. This reverses the water potential gradient. Water moves by osmosis from the cell's cytoplasm (higher water potential) into the surrounding solution (lower water potential). The loss of water causes the vacuole and cytoplasm to shrink, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall. This condition is known as **plasmolysis**.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of states is turgid, turgid, and plasmolysed.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: turgid, plasmolysed, flaccid**\nThis option is incorrect because a plant cell placed in a solution with a higher water potential (the low concentration sucrose solution) will gain water and become turgid, not plasmolysed. Plasmolysis occurs when a cell loses a significant amount of water. Furthermore, in a high concentration solution with a much lower water potential, the cell will lose a large volume of water and become plasmolysed, not merely flaccid.\n\n**B: flaccid, turgid, plasmolysed**\nThis option is incorrect because a plant cell placed in distilled water will not become flaccid. Distilled water has a significantly higher water potential than the cell, leading to a strong net influx of water that makes the cell turgid. A flaccid state implies there is no net movement of water, which would only occur if the water potentials inside and outside the cell were equal.\n\n**C: flaccid, plasmolysed, flaccid**\nThis option is incorrect for all three conditions. A plant cell in distilled water becomes turgid, not flaccid, due to the net influx of water. In the low concentration solution (higher external water potential), the cell also becomes turgid, not plasmolysed. In the high concentration solution (lower external water potential), the significant water loss leads to plasmolysis, a more extreme state than being flaccid."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_206.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "6 which process requires energy from respiration?\na active transport\nb diffusion\nc osmosis\nd transpiration", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nActive transport is the process by which cells move substances across a membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration. This movement occurs against the concentration gradient, which requires the cell to perform work. This work is powered by chemical energy, which is supplied in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is produced during cellular respiration. Therefore, active transport is an 'active' process that is directly dependent on the energy released from respiration to function.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nDiffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, moving down a concentration gradient. This is a passive process, meaning it does not require the cell to expend metabolic energy. The movement is driven by the random kinetic energy of the particles themselves. Consequently, diffusion does not require energy from respiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nOsmosis is a specific type of diffusion involving the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. The movement occurs from a region of higher water potential (dilute solution) to a region of lower water potential (concentrated solution). As a form of diffusion, osmosis is a passive process. It is driven by the difference in water potential and does not require an input of metabolic energy (ATP) from respiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nTranspiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves. The movement of water up the xylem is a physical, passive process driven by the evaporation of water from the leaf surface. This evaporation creates a tension that pulls the column of water up from the roots, a mechanism known as the cohesion-tension theory.

The production of fatty acids causes the pH of the solution to decrease, making it more acidic. For this reaction to occur most quickly, optimal conditions are required. Test-tube A contains milk (the source of the fat substrate), lipase (the enzyme), and bile. Bile is not an enzyme, but it plays a crucial role in fat digestion by emulsifying large fat globules into smaller droplets. This process significantly increases the surface area of the fats, allowing the lipase enzyme to access and break them down more efficiently and rapidly. Therefore, the combination of substrate, enzyme, and an emulsifying agent in test-tube A results in the fastest rate of fatty acid production, causing its contents to become acidic most quickly.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nIn test-tube B, the lipase has been boiled. High temperatures cause enzymes to denature, meaning their specific three-dimensional structure, including the active site, is irreversibly changed. A denatured enzyme is no longer functional and cannot bind to its substrate. Although milk (substrate) and bile are present, the inactive lipase cannot break down the fats. Consequently, fatty acids will not be produced, and the pH of the contents will not become acidic.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nTest-tube C contains milk (substrate) but lacks both active lipase and bile. The lipase has been boiled, which denatures the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Without a functional enzyme, the chemical breakdown of fats into fatty acids cannot occur.

Milk is the source of the fat substrate upon which the enzyme lipase acts. In the absence of its specific substrate, the lipase enzyme has nothing to break down.

According to the principle of limiting factors, the rate of a process is limited by the factor that is in the shortest supply. In this experiment, as light intensity is increased, the rate of photosynthesis (and thus bubble release) increases. This indicates that at lower light levels, light intensity is the limiting factor. However, once the rate becomes constant despite further increases in light intensity, it signifies that another factor is now limiting the process. Carbon dioxide is a crucial raw material for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. At high light intensities, the light-dependent reactions are proceeding at a very high rate, but if the concentration of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water is insufficient to keep pace, the overall rate of photosynthesis will plateau. The plant cannot photosynthesise any faster because it does not have enough carbon dioxide to convert into glucose, even with abundant light energy.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B) Light intensity becomes a limiting factor.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the question describes the scenario where the rate of photosynthesis becomes constant *at high light intensities*. A limiting factor is one that restricts the rate of a process. In this part of the experiment, light is abundant, and increasing its intensity further has no effect on the rate. Therefore, light is no longer the limiting factor; something else is preventing the rate from increasing further. Light intensity is only the limiting factor at the initial, lower levels where an increase in light causes a corresponding increase in the rate of photosynthesis.\n\n**C) Oxygen availability becomes a limiting factor.**\nThis statement is incorrect because oxygen is a *product* of photosynthesis, not a reactant or a necessary condition. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082. The process releases oxygen; it does not consume it. Therefore, the availability of oxygen in the surrounding water does not limit the rate at which photosynthesis can occur.\n\n**D) Water availability becomes a limiting factor.**\nThis statement is incorrect in the context of this experiment. While water is an essential reactant for photosynthesis, the experiment uses an aquatic plant that is completely submerged in water. This setup ensures that the plant has a continuous and abundant supply of water.

Therefore, photosynthesis takes place in both structures 1 and 4.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nWhile structure **1** (palisade mesophyll cell) is a major site of photosynthesis, structure **2** is a xylem vessel. Xylem is a transport tissue responsible for conducting water and dissolved mineral ions from the roots to the rest of the plant. Xylem vessels are composed of dead cells that lack cytoplasm and organelles, including chloroplasts. Consequently, they cannot perform photosynthesis.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nNeither structure **2** (xylem vessel) nor structure **3** (phloem sieve tube) performs photosynthesis. These two tissues form the vascular bundle, which is responsible for transport within the plant. Structure 2, xylem, transports water and lacks chloroplasts. Structure 3, phloem, transports sugars (the products of photosynthesis) but its cells do not contain chloroplasts and therefore cannot photosynthesise.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nWhile structure **4** (spongy mesophyll cell) does perform photosynthesis, structure **3** is a phloem sieve tube. The function of phloem is to transport sugars, such as sucrose, produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant where they are needed for respiration or storage. The cells of the phloem are highly specialised for transport and do not contain chloroplasts, so they are not sites of photosynthesis."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_212.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "12 the diagram shows part of the alimentary canal and associated organs.\nwhich labelled part stores bile?\nd ihm\nha oleae a\nec gd \u00b0\nker", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nThe organ labelled C is the gall bladder.

Initially, carbohydrates are consumed as large, complex polysaccharides, such as starch. These are long chains of simple sugar units. In the mouth, the enzyme salivary amylase starts breaking down these long polysaccharide chains into smaller sugar molecules, primarily the disaccharide maltose (which consists of two glucose units). This process is known as chemical digestion. The process is halted in the acidic environment of the stomach but resumes in the small intestine. Here, pancreatic amylase continues to break down any remaining starch into maltose. Then, enzymes in the intestinal wall, such as maltase, complete the digestion by breaking down the disaccharides (maltose) into single sugar units called monosaccharides (glucose). These small monosaccharide molecules can then be absorbed through the wall of thesmall intestine into the bloodstream. Row B correctly depicts this entire sequence: large polysaccharides are broken into disaccharides in the mouth, and these disaccharides are further broken down into monosaccharides in the small intestine.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A.** This option is incorrect because it shows no chemical digestion occurring in the mouth; the large polysaccharide molecules remain unchanged. Chemical digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth with the action of salivary amylase.

It begins with monosaccharides, which are the final products of digestion, not the starting molecules.

Fibre consists of indigestible plant-based carbohydrates, such as cellulose from plant cell walls. Because it cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, it passes through the small intestine into the large intestine largely unchanged. Here, it adds bulk and softness to the faeces. This increased volume stimulates the muscular walls of the intestine to contract and relax in a wave-like motion called peristalsis, which moves the faeces along the gut more efficiently and prevents them from becoming hard and difficult to pass.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: fat**\nFats are a group of nutrients that serve as a major source of energy, provide insulation, and are essential for the production of cell membranes and certain hormones. They are chemically digested and absorbed in the small intestine. Fats do not provide the indigestible bulk required to stimulate peristalsis in the large intestine and therefore do not directly prevent constipation.\n\n**C: minerals**\nMinerals are inorganic elements required by the body in small amounts for various vital functions, such as bone strength (calcium), nerve impulse transmission (sodium), and oxygen transport in haemoglobin (iron).

The rate of transpiration is highest when the conditions that favour evaporation are maximised. A hot, dry, and windy day provides the ideal combination of these conditions.\n\n*   **Hot Temperature:** High temperatures increase the kinetic energy of water molecules inside the leaf, causing them to evaporate more quickly from the surfaces of the mesophyll cells into the air spaces.\n*   **Dry Air (Low Humidity):** Dry air has a very low concentration of water vapour. This creates a steep water potential gradient between the humid air inside the leaf and the dry air outside. The steeper this gradient, the faster the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata.\n*   **Windy Conditions:** Wind blows away the layer of humid air that accumulates around the stomata. This action maintains the steep water potential gradient, ensuring that water continues to diffuse out of the leaf at a high rate.\n\nBecause the plant is \"well-watered,\" its stomata will be open to facilitate gas exchange for photosynthesis, allowing for a maximal rate of transpiration under these optimal environmental conditions.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. on a cool, dry, windy day**\nWhile dry and windy conditions do promote transpiration by maintaining a steep water potential gradient, the cool temperature is a limiting factor. Lower temperatures reduce the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to a slower rate of evaporation from the mesophyll cells within the leaf. Therefore, the overall transpiration rate would be lower than on a hot day.\n\n**B. on a cool, wet, windy day**\nThis option presents two conditions that significantly reduce the rate of transpiration. The cool temperature slows down evaporation, and the wet (humid) air reduces the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside air. A small gradient leads to a very slow rate of diffusion. Even with wind, the combined effects of low temperature and high humidity result in a very low transpiration rate.\n\n**D. on a hot, wet, windy day**\nAlthough hot and windy conditions are favourable for transpiration, the wet (high humidity) air is a strong limiting factor. High humidity means the air surrounding the leaf is already partially saturated with water vapour. This significantly reduces the water potential gradient between the leaf's interior and the external environment, slowing down the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata.

A **source** is a part of the plant that produces or releases sugars, while a **sink** is a part that consumes or stores them.\n\nDuring photosynthesis, the mature **leaves** are the primary source. They synthesise glucose, which is then converted into sucrose for efficient transport throughout the plant.\n\n**Fruits** are major sinks because they are non-photosynthetic and require a large supply of energy for their growth and development. The sucrose transported to the fruits is often converted into other sugars like fructose and glucose, which accumulate and make the fruit sweet. Therefore, the statement that leaves are a source and fruits are a sink is correct.\n\n### **Explanations for Incorrect Answers**\n\n**A. The flowers, fruits, leaves and roots are all sources of sucrose.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies several plant parts. While mature leaves are the primary source of sucrose during photosynthesis, flowers, fruits, and roots are typically sinks. These parts do not produce their own sugars (or not enough to be self-sufficient) and rely on the sucrose transported from the leaves to fuel their metabolic activities, such as growth, reproduction, and storage.\n\n**B. The fruits are a source of sucrose and the flowers are a sink.**\nThis statement is incorrect because fruits are not sources; they are strong sinks. Fruits require a substantial import of sucrose from the leaves to develop and accumulate sugars for storage. Although it is correct that flowers are sinks (requiring energy for development and nectar production), the initial premise that fruits are a source is false.\n\n**D. The roots are a source of sucrose and the leaves are a sink.**\nThis statement incorrectly reverses the typical roles of leaves and roots during active photosynthesis. Mature leaves are the primary source of sucrose, not a sink. Conversely, roots are sinks as they cannot photosynthesise and require sucrose from the leaves for cellular respiration, growth, and the active uptake of mineral ions. While storage roots (like carrots or turnips) can act as a source by releasing stored sugars during a subsequent growing season, they function as a sink during the period when the leaves are actively photosynthesising."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_219.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "19 what is an advantage of having a double circulatory system?\na it uses less energy because blood flows through the heart only once in each circuit around\nthe body.\nb_ concentration gradients of solutes and gases are kept low.\nc  deoxygenated and oxygenated blood are separated to allow a high rate of oxygen supply\nto the tissues.\nd_ it maintains high-pressure blood flow to the lungs and low-pressure blood flow to the body.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nA double circulatory system involves two separate circuits for blood flow: the pulmonary circuit, which transports blood between the heart and the lungs, and the systemic circuit, which transports blood between the heart and the rest of the body. In mammals and birds, the heart is four-chambered, which completely separates oxygenated blood (in the left side of the heart) from deoxygenated blood (in the right side). This separation ensures that the blood pumped to the body's tissues via the systemic circuit is fully saturated with oxygen. Maximising the oxygen content of the blood creates a steep concentration gradient between the blood in the capillaries and the respiring tissue cells. This steep gradient allows for a very high rate of oxygen diffusion from the blood into the cells, which is essential to support the high metabolic rate and activity levels of these organisms.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n**A:** This statement is incorrect. A defining feature of a double circulatory system is that blood passes through the heart twice for each complete circulation of the body: once on its way to the lungs (pulmonary circuit) and a second time on its way to the body tissues (systemic circuit). A system where blood passes through the heart only once per circuit is a single circulatory system (e.g., in fish). Pumping blood through two distinct circuits, especially the high-pressure systemic circuit, requires a powerful heart and consumes more energy, not less.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect. The efficiency of a circulatory system is dependent on maintaining *high* or *steep* concentration gradients for gases and solutes to facilitate rapid diffusion. A double circulatory system is advantageous because it effectively delivers highly oxygenated blood to tissues and removes waste products like carbon dioxide, thereby maintaining the steep gradients necessary for efficient exchange. Keeping these gradients low would slow down the rate of diffusion and make the system inefficient.\n\n**D:** This statement incorrectly describes the pressure relationship in the two circuits. A key advantage of the double circulatory system is its ability to maintain different pressures in each circuit. The systemic circuit, which pumps blood to the entire body, is a high-pressure system to ensure blood reaches all extremities. Conversely, the pulmonary circuit, which pumps blood only to the nearby lungs, is a low-pressure system. This lower pressure protects the delicate capillaries of the lungs from damage. Therefore, the system maintains low-pressure flow to the lungs and high-pressure flow to the body, the opposite of what is stated."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_220.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "20 the diagram shows the external structure of the human heart.\nwhich part is blocked in coronary heart disease?\npe\n=+\u2014+#\u2014\u2014a\nae :\nea e", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe structure labelled B represents a coronary artery. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that branch off from the aorta and supply the heart muscle (myocardium) with oxygenated blood and essential nutrients. Coronary heart disease is a condition characterised by the narrowing or blockage of these specific arteries, typically due to the build-up of fatty deposits called plaques (a process known as atherosclerosis). This blockage restricts blood flow to the cardiac muscle, depriving it of oxygen, which can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack (myocardial infarction).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:**\nThis structure represents a pulmonary vein. The pulmonary veins transport oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart. While they are a crucial part of the circulatory system, they are not the vessels that supply the heart muscle itself. Therefore, a blockage in a pulmonary vein is not what defines coronary heart disease.\n\n**C:**\nThis structure represents the inferior vena cava.

The cholera toxin, produced by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, acts on the epithelial cells lining the small intestine. It causes these cells to actively secrete chloride ions (Cl\u207b) into the lumen (the cavity) of the small intestine. This large-scale movement of ions into the lumen significantly increases the concentration of solutes in the intestinal fluid. An increase in solute concentration always results in a decrease (or lowering) of the water potential. Consequently, the water potential inside the small intestine becomes much lower than the water potential of the blood and surrounding tissue cells. This establishes a steep water potential gradient, causing water to move by osmosis from the blood and tissues into the intestinal lumen. This massive influx of water into the intestine leads to severe watery diarrhoea, which is the hallmark symptom of cholera.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A: secretion of chloride ions out of the small intestine lowering the water potential**\n    This option is incorrect because the cholera toxin causes the secretion of chloride ions *into* the lumen of the small intestine, not *out of* it. Secretion of ions out of the intestine (i.e., absorption into the body) would increase the solute concentration in the body tissues and *raise* the water potential within the intestine, which would promote water absorption, not cause diarrhoea.\n\n*   **B: secretion of chloride ions out of the small intestine raising the water potential**\n    This option is incorrect primarily because the direction of ion movement is wrong. Chloride ions are secreted *into* the intestine. While moving ions *out* of the intestine would indeed raise its internal water potential (by decreasing solute concentration), this is the opposite of what happens in a cholera infection.\n\n*   **D: secretion of chloride ions into the small intestine raising the water potential**\n    This option correctly identifies that chloride ions are secreted *into* the small intestine. However, it incorrectly states that this *raises* the water potential. The addition of solutes, such as chloride ions, to a solution always *lowers* its water potential (makes it more negative). A raised water potential would inhibit the osmotic movement of water into the intestine, thereby preventing diarrhoea.

Passive immunity is the short-term immunity that results from the introduction of antibodies from another person or animal. A newborn baby's immune system is not yet fully developed. During breastfeeding, particularly in the first few days with the consumption of colostrum, the mother passes on her antibodies to the baby. These antibodies provide the baby with immediate, temporary protection against pathogens to which the mother is immune. This immunity is 'passive' because the baby's own immune system has not produced the antibodies.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A part of the antibody molecule has the same shape as the antigen it acts on.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The part of the antibody molecule that binds to an antigen, known as the binding site or paratope, has a shape that is *complementary* to the shape of the antigen's epitope, not the same. This complementary relationship is often described using a 'lock and key' analogy, where the antibody (the lock) has a specifically shaped binding site that the antigen (the key) fits into perfectly. If they were the same shape, they would not be able to bind together.\n\n**C. Phagocytes produce antibodies.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, are white blood cells that protect the body by engulfing and destroying foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells through a process called phagocytosis. Antibodies, however, are produced by a different type of white blood cell called a B lymphocyte (specifically, by plasma cells, which are differentiated B lymphocytes). While phagocytes can present antigens to lymphocytes to help initiate an immune response, they do not produce antibodies themselves.\n\n**D. Vaccines contain weakened antibodies.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Vaccines contain weakened or inactivated pathogens (like viruses or bacteria), or specific molecules from the pathogen called antigens. The purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the body's own immune system to produce its own antibodies and memory cells against a specific pathogen. This process creates long-lasting, active immunity. Injecting antibodies would provide passive immunity, which is temporary, and is a different type of treatment (e.g., antitoxin injections).

The diaphragm, a large sheet of muscle located beneath the lungs, contracts and flattens downwards. Simultaneously, the external intercostal muscles contract, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards. These actions increase the volume of the thoracic (chest) cavity, which in turn reduces the pressure inside the lungs to below atmospheric pressure, causing air to be drawn into the lungs.\n\nThe airways, such as the trachea and bronchi, are lined with specialised ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells. Goblet cells secrete sticky mucus, which traps inhaled dust, pollen, and pathogens like bacteria. The cilia are tiny, hair-like projections that beat in a coordinated, wave-like manner. This action propels the mucus upwards, away from the lungs and towards the throat (pharynx), where it can be swallowed or coughed out. This mechanism is known as the mucociliary escalator. Therefore, the function of the cilia is to carry mucus to the throat.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: contracts to cause breathing out / trap bacteria from the air**\nThis option is incorrect. The contraction of the diaphragm causes breathing in (inhalation), not breathing out (exhalation). Exhalation is typically a passive process resulting from the *relaxation* of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Furthermore, while the respiratory system does trap bacteria, this is the function of the mucus lining the airways, not the cilia themselves. The cilia's role is to move the mucus, not to trap particles directly.\n\n**C: relaxes to cause breathing in / filter dust from the air**\nThis option is incorrect. The relaxation of the diaphragm decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity, leading to breathing out (exhalation), not breathing in. Breathing in requires the diaphragm to *contract*. Additionally, the filtering of dust is performed by the mucus that lines the respiratory tract. The cilia then move this mucus; they do not act as the primary filter.\n\n**D: relaxes to cause breathing out / produce mucus**\nThis option is incorrect. While it is true that the diaphragm relaxes to cause breathing out, the cilia do not produce mucus.

The accumulation of lactic acid leads to muscle fatigue and creates an 'oxygen debt'. This debt is the extra oxygen required after exercise to restore the body to its resting state. The process that removes this debt primarily involves the fate of the accumulated lactic acid. Lactic acid is transported from the muscles via the bloodstream to the liver. In the liver, with a sufficient supply of oxygen, the lactic acid is either broken down into carbon dioxide and water through aerobic respiration or converted back into glucose. Both of these metabolic pathways require oxygen, and it is this aerobic processing of lactic acid in the liver that repays the oxygen debt.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nA decrease in breathing rate would reduce the intake of oxygen into the lungs and subsequently into the bloodstream. Repaying an oxygen debt requires an *increased* supply of oxygen to metabolise the accumulated lactic acid. Therefore, after vigorous exercise, the breathing rate and depth remain elevated to maximise oxygen intake. A decrease in breathing rate would hinder, not help, the process of removing the oxygen debt.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nA decrease in heart rate would slow down the circulation of blood throughout the body. To remove the oxygen debt, oxygen taken in by the lungs must be transported efficiently to the liver, and lactic acid must be transported from the muscles to the liver. After strenuous exercise, the heart rate remains elevated to ensure rapid transport of both oxygen and lactic acid via the blood. A decreased heart rate would slow down this transport, prolonging the recovery process.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nAn increase in blood supply to the skin is a physiological response for thermoregulation, not for removing oxygen debt. During exercise, muscle activity generates significant heat. To prevent the body from overheating, blood vessels near the skin's surface dilate (vasodilation), increasing blood flow. This allows excess heat to be lost to the environment. While this process occurs during and after exercise, its primary function is temperature control, not the metabolic breakdown of lactic acid."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_225.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "25 in healthy people, which substance is completely reabsorbed into the blood from the kidney\nnephrons?\na_ glucose\nb .ssalts\nc urea\nd_ water", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn a healthy individual, all of the glucose that is filtered from the blood in the glomerulus into the nephron tubule is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This process, known as selective reabsorption, occurs primarily in the proximal convoluted tubule. Glucose is a vital source of energy for cellular respiration, and the body conserves it efficiently. The reabsorption of glucose is an active process, requiring energy, which moves all of the glucose molecules from the filtrate back into the blood capillaries surrounding the tubule. Consequently, the urine of a healthy person should contain no glucose.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nSalts (mineral ions) are filtered from the blood into the nephron. However, they are not completely reabsorbed. The amount of salt reabsorbed is carefully regulated to maintain the correct ion concentration and osmotic balance in the blood. This process is part of homeostasis. If the body has an excess of salts, less will be reabsorbed, and the surplus will be excreted in the urine. Conversely, if the body is deficient in salts, more will be reabsorbed. Because the quantity reabsorbed is variable and dependent on the body's needs, reabsorption is selective, not complete.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nUrea is the primary nitrogenous waste product resulting from the breakdown of amino acids in the liver. It is toxic in high concentrations, and a key function of the kidneys is to remove it from the blood and excrete it in urine. While urea is filtered into the nephron, and a small amount is reabsorbed to help maintain the concentration gradient in the medulla for water reabsorption, the majority of it is purposely left in the filtrate to be eliminated from the body. Therefore, urea is not completely reabsorbed; it is mainly excreted.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nWater is essential for life, and its balance in the body is tightly controlled through a process called osmoregulation. While a large amount of water is reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood along the nephron and collecting duct, it is not completely reabsorbed. The amount of water reabsorbed is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) based on the body's hydration level. If the body is dehydrated, ADH levels increase, and more water is reabsorbed. If the body is well-hydrated, ADH levels decrease, and less water is reabsorbed, resulting in the production of more dilute urine.

A small pupil reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, protecting it from damage and ensuring clear vision.\n\n2.  **Lens Shape (Fat):** Focusing on a near object, such as a mobile phone, requires the lens to increase its refractive power. This process is called accommodation. The ciliary muscles contract, which causes the suspensory ligaments to slacken.

On a hot day, the body must lose excess heat to the environment to prevent overheating. This is achieved through vasodilation. Vasodilation is the widening of the arterioles (small arteries) that lead to the capillaries near the skin's surface. This widening increases the flow of warm blood to the skin. As more blood flows close to the surface, more thermal energy (heat) is lost to the cooler surroundings through radiation, effectively cooling the body and helping to maintain a constant internal temperature.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Vasoconstriction increases blood flow to the skin surface capillaries.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels, which *decreases* blood flow, not increases it. Secondly, vasoconstriction is a physiological response to cold, not heat. It serves to conserve body heat by reducing blood flow to the skin, thus minimising heat loss to the environment.\n\n**B. Vasoconstriction decreases blood flow to the skin surface capillaries.**\nWhile this statement correctly describes the effect of vasoconstriction, it is the incorrect mechanism for the situation described. Vasoconstriction is initiated when the body needs to conserve heat, for example, on a cold day. By decreasing blood flow to the skin surface, the body reduces the amount of heat lost to the environment. On a hot day, the body's objective is to lose excess heat, not conserve it.\n\n**D. Vasodilation decreases blood flow to the skin surface capillaries.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The term \"vasodilation\" refers to the widening or dilation of blood vessels.

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels, typically after a meal rich in carbohydrates. Insulin acts on cells, particularly in the liver and muscles, stimulating them to increase their uptake of glucose from the bloodstream. Inside these cells, the glucose is converted into glycogen, a storage polysaccharide. This process, known as glycogenesis, effectively removes glucose from the blood, causing its concentration to fall back to the normal range.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** An increased release of adrenaline would lead to an *increase* in blood glucose concentration. Adrenaline is a hormone released by the adrenal glands during times of stress or excitement (the 'fight or flight' response). It stimulates the liver to break down its stores of glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis) and release it into the blood. This provides a rapid supply of energy for the muscles.\n\n**B:** Amylase is a digestive enzyme, not a hormone that regulates blood glucose. It is produced by the salivary glands and the pancreas. Its function is to break down complex carbohydrates, such as starch, into simpler sugars, like maltose. The subsequent absorption of these sugars from the small intestine into the bloodstream would lead to an *increase*, not a decrease, in blood glucose concentration.\n\n**C:** An increased release of glucagon would lead to an *increase* in blood glucose concentration. Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas when blood glucose levels are low. It acts on the liver, stimulating the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose (a process called glycogenolysis), which is then released into the blood. Glucagon and insulin are antagonistic hormones, meaning they have opposite effects to maintain blood glucose homeostasis."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_229.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "29 which statement about antibiotics is correct?\na_ antibiotics do not affect bacteria but kill viruses.\nb_ antibiotics do not affect bacteria or viruses.\nc_ antibiotics kill bacteria and kill viruses.\nd_ antibiotics kill bacteria but do not affect viruses.", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nAntibiotics are a class of antimicrobial drugs used specifically for treating and preventing bacterial infections. They function by targeting and disrupting essential life processes that are unique to bacteria. For example, some antibiotics inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, a structure that is absent in viruses and animal cells. Others interfere with bacterial protein synthesis or DNA replication. Because viruses are not living cells and lack these specific structures and metabolic pathways, antibiotics are ineffective against them. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on the host cell's machinery to replicate, and therefore require different types of medication, such as antivirals, for treatment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Antibiotics do not affect bacteria but kill viruses.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The primary and intended function of antibiotics is to inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria. They are specifically designed to target bacterial structures and metabolic processes.

The acrosome is a cap-like structure on the head of the sperm that contains hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes are essential for digesting the protective jelly coat (zona pellucida) of the egg cell.

After ovulation (around day 14), the remnants of the ovarian follicle develop into the corpus luteum, which begins to secrete large amounts of progesterone. The primary functions of progesterone are to further prepare the uterine lining (endometrium) for the potential implantation of a fertilised egg and to maintain this lining throughout a potential pregnancy. It also inhibits the secretion of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, preventing the development of new follicles.\n\nLine B accurately represents this pattern. The hormone concentration is low during the first half of the cycle (follicular phase), begins to rise sharply immediately after ovulation, peaks approximately midway through the luteal phase (around day 21), and then declines towards the end of the cycle if fertilisation does not occur. This decline in progesterone leads to the breakdown of the uterine lining and the onset of menstruation.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** This line represents Luteinising Hormone (LH). LH concentration remains low for most of the cycle but experiences a dramatic, sharp surge approximately 24-36 hours before ovulation.

For a trait to be selected for, it must be genetically based and passed down to the next generation. The organisms that survive due to their advantageous appearance will reproduce, passing the alleles (versions of a gene) responsible for that appearance to their offspring.

Producers, such as plants and algae, capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This stored chemical energy, in the form of organic molecules, is then passed through the various trophic levels of an ecosystem, from producers to consumers and decomposers. Therefore, the continuous input of solar energy is essential to sustain life and drive ecological processes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. glucose**\nGlucose is a vital molecule that stores chemical energy, which organisms use for cellular respiration. However, it is not the *initial* source of energy input to biological systems. The energy contained within the chemical bonds of glucose is derived from the conversion of light energy from the Sun during photosynthesis. Therefore, glucose is an energy carrier or a form of stored energy *within* the system, not the original source.\n\n**B. oxygen**\nOxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the metabolic pathway that efficiently releases the energy stored in glucose. In this process, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, enabling the production of large amounts of ATP. However, oxygen itself is not a source of energy; it is a reactant that facilitates the release of energy from organic molecules. The energy originates from the Sun, not from oxygen.\n\n**C. plants**\nPlants are producers, meaning they are the organisms that convert light energy into chemical energy. They form the base of most food chains by capturing solar energy through photosynthesis and making it available to other organisms. While they are the crucial link that brings energy into the ecosystem's food web, they are energy converters (transducers), not the original source of the energy itself.

This process is called assimilation. The nitrogen from these nitrate ions is then used to synthesize essential organic molecules, such as amino acids, proteins, chlorophyll, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which are vital for the plant's growth and development.\n\n2.  **Denitrifying Bacteria:** These bacteria thrive in anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions within the soil. Through a process called denitrification, they use nitrate ions as an alternative to oxygen for respiration. They convert nitrate ions (NO\u2083\u207b) back into gaseous nitrogen (N\u2082), which is then released into the atmosphere. This process completes the nitrogen cycle by returning nitrogen to the atmosphere and reduces the availability of nitrates in the soil for plants.\n\nTherefore, both denitrifying bacteria and plants are responsible for removing nitrate ions from the soil.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. denitrifying bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules:**\nWhile denitrifying bacteria do remove nitrate ions, nitrogen-fixing bacteria do not. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as *Rhizobium* in the root nodules of leguminous plants, convert inert atmospheric nitrogen gas (N\u2082) into ammonium compounds (NH\u2084\u207a). This process, known as nitrogen fixation, *adds* usable nitrogen to the soil, rather than removing existing nitrate ions.\n\n**C. nitrifying bacteria and plants:**\nWhile plants do remove nitrate ions, nitrifying bacteria do the opposite. Nitrifying bacteria carry out nitrification, a two-step process where they convert ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a) into nitrite ions (NO\u2082\u207b) and then into nitrate ions (NO\u2083\u207b). This process *increases* the concentration of nitrate ions in the soil, making them available for plant uptake.\n\n**D. nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules:**\nNitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas (N\u2082) into ammonium compounds. They do not interact with or remove nitrate ions from the soil. Their role is to introduce new, usable nitrogen into the ecosystem, which can subsequently be converted into nitrates by nitrifying bacteria."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_239.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "39 what are two reasons for organisms becoming endangered?\n1 habitat destruction\n2 monitoring\n3 education\n4 pollution\n5 captive breeding programmes\na iand4 b 1and5 c 2and3 d 3and4", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nHabitat destruction and pollution are two significant reasons why organisms become endangered.\n\n1.  **Habitat Destruction:** The loss or fragmentation of an organism's natural habitat is the primary driver of extinction worldwide. Activities such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agriculture remove the specific resources\u2014food, water, shelter, and breeding sites\u2014that species need to survive and reproduce. This leads to a decline in population size, making the species vulnerable to endangerment.\n\n2.  **Pollution:** The introduction of harmful substances into the environment can have devastating effects on wildlife. Chemical pollutants from industry and agriculture can poison organisms directly, disrupt their reproductive or endocrine systems, and accumulate in food chains (bioaccumulation). Plastic pollution can cause entanglement and ingestion, while oil spills can destroy entire aquatic ecosystems. These pressures reduce survival and reproductive rates, contributing to population decline.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. 1 and 5:** While habitat destruction (1) is a major cause of endangerment, captive breeding programmes (5) are a conservation strategy designed to prevent extinction. These programmes involve breeding species in controlled environments, such as zoos or sanctuaries, with the goal of increasing their numbers and eventually reintroducing them to protected habitats in the wild. Therefore, captive breeding is a solution to, not a cause of, endangerment.\n\n**C. 2 and 3:** Both monitoring (2) and education (3) are conservation measures, not causes of endangerment. Monitoring involves tracking the population size, health, and distribution of a species to assess its status and the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Education aims to raise public awareness about threats to biodiversity and promote actions that help protect species and their habitats. These are tools used to combat the problem of endangerment.\n\n**D. 3 and 4:** Although pollution (4) is a valid reason for organisms becoming endangered, education (3) is not. Education is a key component of conservation efforts. By informing people about the causes and consequences of species decline, education programmes encourage support for conservation policies and promote behaviours that reduce human impact on the environment.

This is typically done by inserting a specific gene from one species into the DNA of another to introduce a desired characteristic. Option C, \"inserting genes into crop plants to improve the nutritional qualities of the plant,\" is a direct description of this process. For example, 'Golden Rice' is a genetically modified crop that has had genes inserted to enable it to produce beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: choosing cattle to breed so that alleles for high milk yield will be passed on to their offspring**\nThis describes **selective breeding**, also called artificial selection. This is a traditional method where humans choose organisms with desirable traits and breed them together over many generations. While it aims to increase the frequency of desirable alleles in a population, it works with the natural genetic variation that already exists within a species. It does not involve laboratory techniques to directly insert or alter specific genes in the organism's DNA.\n\n**B: increasing food production by using insecticides to improve quality and yield**\nThis describes an agricultural practice involving the use of chemicals.

It is defined as a permanent increase in the size and dry mass of an organism, achieved through an increase in cell number, cell size, or both. From the simplest unicellular bacteria, which increase in size before dividing, to complex multicellular organisms like plants and animals that grow from a single cell into a mature individual, growth is a universal life process.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria (cyanobacteria), convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process is not carried out by all organisms. Heterotrophic organisms, including all animals and fungi, cannot perform photosynthesis and must obtain energy by consuming other organisms.\n\n**C. sexual reproduction**\nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes to form a zygote, leading to offspring with genetic variation. However, not all organisms reproduce sexually. Many organisms, such as bacteria, reproduce exclusively through asexual methods like binary fission. Other organisms, including many plants, fungi, and simple animals, are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Since it is not the sole method of reproduction for all life, it is not a universal process.\n\n**D. transpiration**\nTranspiration is the process of water loss in the form of water vapour from the surfaces of a plant, primarily through small pores called stomata on the leaves.

This means the concentration of water molecules is higher outside the cell than inside the cell's cytoplasm and vacuole. In other words, the distilled water has a higher water potential than the cell sap. Due to osmosis, there is a net movement of water molecules from the region of higher water potential (the distilled water) into the region of lower water potential (the cell) across the partially permeable cell membrane.\n\nAs water enters the cell, the vacuole swells and pushes the cell's contents (the protoplast) against the strong, rigid cellulose cell wall. This creates internal pressure known as turgor pressure, causing the cell to become firm and swollen. This state is described as turgid. The inelastic cell wall prevents the cell from taking in too much water and bursting.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A - burst:** Plant cells do not burst when placed in distilled water because they are surrounded by a strong and rigid cellulose cell wall. While water enters the cell due to osmosis and causes it to swell, the cell wall exerts an opposing pressure (wall pressure) that prevents the cell from expanding indefinitely and rupturing. Animal cells, which lack a cell wall, would burst (undergo lysis) under the same conditions.\n\n*   **B - flaccid:** A flaccid state occurs when a plant cell has lost some water, causing the protoplast to not press firmly against the cell wall. This happens when the cell is in an isotonic solution, where the water potential inside and outside the cell is equal, resulting in no net movement of water. In the given scenario, the cell is in a hypotonic solution (distilled water), so it will gain water and become turgid, not flaccid.\n\n*   **C - plasmolysed:** Plasmolysis is the condition where a plant cell loses a significant amount of water, causing the vacuole and cytoplasm to shrink and the cell membrane to pull away from the cell wall. This process occurs when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution (e.g., a concentrated salt or sugar solution) where the external water potential is lower than that of the cell. Since the cell is in distilled water (a hypotonic solution), water moves into the cell, which is the opposite of the conditions required for plasmolysis."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_246.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "6 which diagram represents active transport?\na b\n\u2014 partially permeable \u2014\u2014 partially permeable\ns | cell membrane | cell membrane\ne ai | \u00b0 \u00b0 | a \u00b0\nete \u00ab = eles 4\n\u00b0 *) \u2018 * ie \u00b0\n\u2018 \u201c| \u00b0 ~\u00ab | =* \u00b0\n. | \u00b0 = | \u00b0\n. eu ie e\nrequires energy requires energy\nfrom respiration from respiration\ncc d\n_ partially permeable ee partially permeable\n. 2 2% 4 cell membrane - * 4 * cell membrane\ne i el e \u00ab * . e le . . we\n\u00b0 \u2014 . . 2 ae =\n\u201cse \u00ab\u00a9 ie\" -@ en\n\u00b0 e e | - \u00a5 | e e e\n\u00b0 : le \u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0| * \u00b0\n1 l\ndoes not require energy does not require energy\nfrom respiration from respiration", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nActive transport is the process of moving substances across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration.

The shape of the enzyme's active site changes as the pH increases from 7 to 9.**\n\nEnzymes are proteins, and their function is critically dependent on their specific three-dimensional structure, particularly the shape of the active site. This structure is maintained by chemical bonds, including hydrogen and ionic bonds, between the amino acids that make up the protein.\n\nThe pH of the surrounding environment affects the charges on these amino acids. Each enzyme has an optimal pH at which its active site has the precise shape and charge distribution to be most complementary to its substrate, resulting in the maximum rate of reaction. In the graph, this optimal pH is 7.\n\nAs the pH increases from 7 to 9, the environment becomes more alkaline. This change in H+ ion concentration alters the charges on the amino acid R-groups within the enzyme. The disruption of these charges breaks the ionic and hydrogen bonds that maintain the enzyme's tertiary structure. Consequently, the shape of the active site is altered, a process known as denaturation. As the active site's shape changes, it becomes less complementary to the substrate, reducing the efficiency of binding and thus decreasing the rate of the catalysed reaction, as shown by the downward slope of the graph from pH 7 to 9.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. As the pH increases from 5 to 7, the kinetic energy increases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the kinetic energy of molecules is primarily dependent on temperature, not pH. An increase in temperature causes molecules to move faster, thereby increasing their kinetic energy and the frequency of collisions. While the reaction rate does increase as the pH moves from 5 to 7, this is due to the enzyme's active site approaching its optimal conformation, allowing for more efficient binding with the substrate, not due to a change in kinetic energy.\n\n**B. As the pH increases from 7 to 9, the frequency of enzyme and substrate collisions increases.**\n\nThis statement contradicts the data shown in the graph. The graph illustrates that as the pH increases from 7 to 9, the rate of reaction *decreases*. A decrease in the reaction rate indicates a *decrease* in the frequency of *effective* collisions between the enzyme's active site and the substrate. The reason for this decrease is the denaturation of the enzyme, which alters the active site's shape, preventing the substrate from binding properly.\n\n**D. The substrate denatures at pH 7.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, denaturation is a term that describes the loss of the specific three-dimensional structure of a protein, such as an enzyme. Substrates are typically not proteins and do not denature. Secondly, pH 7 is the optimal pH for this enzyme, where the reaction rate is at its maximum. This indicates that the enzyme is in its most active and functional state, and the substrate is binding effectively. Denaturation of either the enzyme or substrate would lead to a decrease or cessation of the reaction, not a peak in activity."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_249.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "9 which sentence explains the importance of vascular bundles for photosynthesis?\na_ vascular bundles transport carbon dioxide to the leaf.\nb_ vascular bundles transport oxygen to the leaf.\nc_ vascular bundles transport starch to the leaf.\nd_ vascular bundles transport water to the leaf.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Rationale for the correct answer: D\n\nThe process of photosynthesis requires two primary reactants: carbon dioxide and water.

This long-distance transport of water is the function of the xylem tissue, which is a key component of the plant's vascular bundles. Therefore, by delivering water\u2014a crucial raw material\u2014to the photosynthetic cells in the leaf, vascular bundles play an essential role in photosynthesis.\n\n---\n### Rationale for the incorrect answers:\n\n**A. Vascular bundles transport carbon dioxide to the leaf.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Carbon dioxide is a gas that is present in the atmosphere. It enters the leaf directly from the air through small pores on the leaf surface called stomata. The process of entry is diffusion, driven by a concentration gradient. Vascular bundles are internal transport systems and are not involved in the uptake of atmospheric gases.\n\n**B. Vascular bundles transport oxygen to the leaf.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, not a reactant needed for the process. During photosynthesis, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen. This oxygen is then considered a waste product and diffuses out of the leaf through the stomata into the atmosphere. Vascular bundles do not transport oxygen to the leaf for the purpose of photosynthesis.\n\n**C. Vascular bundles transport starch to the leaf.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Photosynthesis produces glucose, which is a simple sugar. This glucose is either used immediately for respiration or converted into sucrose for transport or starch for storage.

Pancreatic amylase is responsible for the chemical digestion of starch, breaking it down into the disaccharide maltose.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. gall bladder**\nThe gall bladder is a small organ located beneath the liver. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, which is produced by the liver. Bile plays a crucial role in digestion by emulsifying fats, breaking large fat globules into smaller droplets to increase the surface area for lipase enzymes to act upon. The gall bladder does not produce amylase or any other digestive enzymes.\n\n**B. kidney**\nThe kidneys are the principal organs of the urinary system. Their main functions are to filter waste products, such as urea, from the blood to produce urine, and to regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and water content in the body (osmoregulation).

These molecules diffuse into the epithelial cells lining the villi. Inside these cells, they are re-formed into triglycerides and then combined with proteins to form structures called chylomicrons. Due to their large size, chylomicrons cannot enter the blood capillaries. Instead, they are absorbed into the lacteals, which are specialized lymphatic capillaries located in the center of each villus. The lymph fluid, now rich in fats and appearing milky (hence the name 'lacteal'), transports these chylomicrons through the lymphatic system, which eventually drains into the bloodstream.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. amino acids**\nAmino acids are the final products of protein digestion. They are absorbed from the lumen of the small intestine into the epithelial cells of the villi, primarily through active transport. From these cells, amino acids pass directly into the blood capillaries within the villus, not the lacteal. They are then transported in the blood to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.\n\n**C. lactic acid**\nLactic acid is not a nutrient absorbed from the digestion of food in the small intestine. It is a metabolic by-product of anaerobic respiration, which occurs in cells (like muscle cells) when oxygen is scarce. Lactic acid is transported by the blood to the liver, where it can be converted back into glucose, but it is not absorbed from the gut.\n\n**D. hydrochloric acid**\nHydrochloric acid is secreted by the stomach to create an acidic environment for the enzyme pepsin and to kill pathogens.

The small intestine is the primary site for the absorption of both digested nutrients and water. It is highly adapted for this function with a very large surface area, created by its considerable length, internal folds, and the presence of millions of microscopic projections called villi and microvilli. A large volume of water, from both ingested fluids and digestive secretions, enters the small intestine. As digested food molecules (solutes) are actively absorbed from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream, the water potential of the blood is lowered. This creates a steep water potential gradient, causing water to move by osmosis from the lumen into the blood. The vast majority, approximately 90%, of water absorption in the entire alimentary canal occurs in the small intestine.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The structure labelled A is the stomach. The primary roles of the stomach are the mechanical churning of food and the chemical digestion of proteins by the enzyme pepsin in an acidic environment. The stomach wall is largely impermeable to water, and very little absorption of any substances, including water, occurs here.\n\n**B:** The structure labelled B is the pancreas, which is an accessory organ of the digestive system, not a part of the alimentary canal through which food passes. Its function is to produce digestive enzymes, which are secreted into the small intestine, and to produce hormones like insulin. No absorption of water from digested food occurs in the pancreas.\n\n**C:** The structure labelled C is the large intestine. A key function of the large intestine is to absorb water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter. However, the volume of water absorbed in the large intestine is significantly less than that absorbed in the small intestine.

This process, known as lignification, makes the cell walls very strong and woody. The primary function of this lignification is to provide mechanical strength and support to the plant, helping it to stand upright and withstand physical stresses such as wind. Lignin also makes the xylem vessels waterproof, which is essential for their role in water transport.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. cells are joined end to end**\nThe arrangement of xylem cells joined end to end forms a continuous, long tube known as a xylem vessel. This structural feature is an adaptation for the efficient transport of water, creating an uninterrupted column from the roots to the leaves. While this continuous structure is part of the overall plant architecture, the support itself is provided by the material reinforcing the walls of this tube, not by the end-to-end arrangement of the cells.\n\n**B. no cell contents**\nXylem vessels are dead at maturity and lack a nucleus, cytoplasm, vacuole, and other organelles.

This feature does not contribute to the mechanical support of the plant.\n\n**C. no cross-walls**\nThe end walls between the individual cells that make up a xylem vessel disintegrate and disappear.

This process is a form of diffusion, driven by a difference in water vapor concentration (or water potential gradient) between the moist interior of the leaf and the drier air outside. Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. When humidity is low, the air is dry, meaning there is a low concentration of water vapor outside the leaf. This creates a steep water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the surrounding air. As a result, water vapor diffuses out of the stomata at a faster rate, thereby increasing the rate of transpiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. decreasing light intensity**\nLight is the primary trigger for the opening of stomata, which are the main sites of transpiration. In the presence of light, stomata open to allow for the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. As a side effect, water vapor escapes. When light intensity decreases, the rate of photosynthesis slows down, and the stomata begin to close to conserve water. The closure of stomata reduces the surface area available for water vapor to exit the leaf, thus decreasing the rate of transpiration.\n\n**C. decreasing temperature**\nTemperature affects the kinetic energy of water molecules. Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy, causing water to evaporate more quickly from the surfaces of the spongy mesophyll cells inside the leaf and diffuse faster through the stomata. Conversely, a decrease in temperature reduces the kinetic energy of water molecules. This slows down the rate of evaporation within the leaf and the rate of diffusion out of the stomata, leading to a decrease in the overall rate of transpiration.\n\n**D. decreasing wind speed**\nWind removes the layer of humid air, known as the boundary layer, that accumulates around the surface of a leaf as water vapor exits the stomata. By blowing this layer away, wind maintains a steep water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the surrounding air, which promotes transpiration. If the wind speed decreases, this humid boundary layer is not removed as effectively. The accumulation of water vapor around the stomata reduces the water potential gradient, which in turn slows down the rate of diffusion and decreases the rate of transpiration."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_257.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "17. which statement describes translocation?\na_ the movement of amino acids and sucrose from the source to the sink in phloem\nb the movement of amino acids and sucrose from the source to the sink in xylem\nc_ the movement of amino acids and sucrose from the sink to the source in phloem\nd the movement of amino acids and sucrose from the sink to the source in xylem", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nTranslocation is the process by which plants transport soluble organic substances, primarily sucrose and amino acids, from where they are produced to where they are needed for growth or storage.

However, it incorrectly suggests that the breathing rate increases (1) before the brain detects the change in blood carbon dioxide (4) and sends nerve signals (3). The increase in breathing rate is the final response, which can only occur after the stimulus (high CO2) has been detected by the brain and the command to increase breathing has been transmitted to the respiratory muscles."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_262.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "22 two molecules of glucose are aerobically respired.\nhow many molecules of water are produced?\na 1 b 2 cc 6 d 12", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the complete aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose is:\nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 \u2192 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O\n\nThis equation shows that for every one molecule of glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) that is fully oxidised, six molecules of water (H\u2082O) are produced as a waste product.

Its cells carry out aerobic respiration to produce the ATP required for processes such as the active transport of substances during selective reabsorption. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of aerobic respiration. As blood flows through the capillaries of the kidney, carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring kidney cells into the blood. Consequently, the blood leaving the kidney via the renal vein has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than the blood that entered through the renal artery.\n\n**B. glucose is incorrect.** Glucose is a key reactant for cellular respiration. The kidney cells absorb glucose from the blood delivered by the renal artery to meet their energy demands. Although glucose that is filtered into the nephron is almost entirely reabsorbed back into the blood, the kidney tissue itself consumes some glucose. Therefore, the concentration of glucose in the blood leaving the kidney via the renal vein is slightly lower than in the renal artery.\n\n**C. oxygen is incorrect.** Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration. The renal artery supplies oxygenated blood to the kidney tissues. The kidney cells take up this oxygen from the blood to respire and release energy. As a result, the blood becomes deoxygenated as it passes through the kidney. The blood in the renal vein therefore has a lower concentration of oxygen than the blood in the renal artery.\n\n**D. urea is incorrect.** The primary function of the kidney is to filter nitrogenous waste, primarily urea, from the blood to form urine. The renal artery carries blood with a high concentration of urea to the kidneys. In the nephrons, urea is filtered from the blood and is not reabsorbed, leading to its excretion in urine. This process cleanses the blood, so the blood returning to the general circulation via the renal vein has a significantly lower concentration of urea than the blood in the renal artery."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_264.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "24 where are amino acids deaminated and converted into urea?\na bladder\nb_ kidneys\nc siiver\nd pancreas", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C liver**\n\nThe liver is the principal site for the metabolism of excess amino acids. When the body has more amino acids than it needs for protein synthesis and other functions, they are transported to the liver. Here, they undergo a process called deamination, where the amino group (-NH\u2082) is removed from the amino acid molecule. This removal results in the formation of a highly toxic compound, ammonia. The liver then rapidly converts this toxic ammonia into a much less toxic, water-soluble compound called urea through a series of biochemical reactions known as the urea cycle. The urea is then released into the bloodstream, transported to the kidneys, and excreted in urine.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A bladder:** The bladder is a muscular sac that serves as a storage organ for urine before it is expelled from the body during urination. It does not perform metabolic functions like deamination or the synthesis of urea. It only holds the final excretory fluid, which contains urea produced by the liver.\n\n**B kidneys:** The primary function of the kidneys is to filter waste products, such as urea, from the blood to produce urine. While the kidneys are central to excretion, they are not the site where urea is synthesized from amino acids. Their role is to remove the urea that was produced in the liver from the circulation.\n\n**D pancreas:** The pancreas has two main functions: an endocrine function (producing hormones like insulin and glucagon) and an exocrine function (producing digestive enzymes).

When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. This creates a high concentration of neurotransmitter molecules in the cleft, right next to the presynaptic membrane. The postsynaptic membrane, on the other hand, has a very low concentration of these neurotransmitters. Due to this concentration gradient, the neurotransmitter molecules passively move from the area of high concentration (presynaptic side) to the area of low concentration (postsynaptic side). This net movement of particles down a concentration gradient is the definition of diffusion.\n\n---\n### Rationale for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. active transport**\n\nActive transport is the movement of substances against a concentration gradient, a process that requires energy in the form of ATP. While active transport is crucial for the reuptake of some neurotransmitters back into the presynaptic neuron after they have transmitted their signal, it is not the process that moves them *across* the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic neuron. The initial movement across the cleft is a passive process, driven by a concentration gradient, not an energy-dependent one.\n\n**C. gravity**\n\nGravity is a physical force that pulls objects with mass towards each other. It is not the primary mechanism for the movement of molecules at the microscopic level of a synapse. Synapses are oriented in all directions throughout the nervous system, and their function is independent of the body's orientation relative to gravity. The movement of neurotransmitters is governed by chemical principles, specifically the concentration gradient, which is a much stronger influence over such a tiny distance than gravity.\n\n**D. osmosis**\n\nOsmosis is a specific type of diffusion that refers exclusively to the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. The question concerns the movement of neurotransmitter molecules, which are solutes, not water.

The pancreas, specifically the alpha (\u03b1) cells within the islets of Langerhans, detects this decrease. In response, these cells secrete the hormone glucagon into the bloodstream.

This process is regulated by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is produced in the tip of the shoot and diffuses downwards. When light shines on the shoot from one side (unilateral light), it causes auxin to migrate from the illuminated side to the shaded side. This results in a higher concentration of auxin on the shaded side (Statement 2). In shoots, auxin stimulates cell elongation. Therefore, the higher concentration of auxin on the shaded side causes the cells on this side to elongate more rapidly and to a greater extent than the cells on the illuminated side (Statement 4).

Antibiotics are used to treat all transmissible diseases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Transmissible diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protoctists. Antibiotics are specifically designed to be effective against bacterial infections. They have no effect on diseases caused by other types of pathogens, such as the common cold or influenza (caused by viruses), or malaria (caused by a protoctist). Each type of pathogen requires a specific class of antimicrobial drug for treatment (e.g., antivirals for viruses, antifungals for fungi).\n\n**B. Antibiotics are used to treat diseases caused by viruses.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibiotics work by targeting specific structures or metabolic pathways found in bacterial cells, such as the synthesis of the cell wall or the function of bacterial ribosomes. Viruses are not cells; they lack these structures and metabolic processes. Viruses are much simpler entities that replicate by invading a host's cells and using the host's cellular machinery. Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. Diseases caused by viruses are treated with a different class of drugs called antivirals.\n\n**C. Antibiotic resistance can be stopped by increasing their use.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Increasing the use of antibiotics actually accelerates the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance occurs through the process of natural selection. Within any large population of bacteria, some individuals may have random mutations that make them resistant to an antibiotic. When the antibiotic is used, it kills the non-resistant (susceptible) bacteria, but the resistant bacteria survive and reproduce. This leads to a population dominated by the resistant strain. Overusing or misusing antibiotics (e.g., for viral infections or not completing the prescribed course) increases this selective pressure, making resistance a more significant problem. To combat resistance, antibiotic use must be carefully managed and reduced.\n\n**D. Antibiotics are used to treat diseases caused by bacteria.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Antibiotics are antimicrobial substances that are specifically effective against bacteria. They function either by killing bacteria (bactericidal effect) or by inhibiting their growth and reproduction (bacteriostatic effect). They achieve this by interfering with vital processes unique to bacteria, such as the synthesis of their cell walls, the replication of their DNA, or the synthesis of essential proteins. Because these targets are absent or structurally different in human cells, antibiotics can selectively eliminate bacterial pathogens with minimal harm to the host."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_269.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "29 fusarium wilt is a fungal disease of bananas that can spread quickly through a banana population.\nthe table shows the area affected by fusarium wilt over time in one country.\nar area affected with\ny fusarium wilt / hectares\n1976 1200\n1983 1500\n1999 3000\nwhat was the percentage increase in the area affected with fusarium wilt from 1976 to 1999?\na 40% b 60% c 150% d 250%", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe percentage increase is calculated using the formula: ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) \u00d7 100.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final values from the table:**\n    *   Initial area (in 1976) = 1200 hectares.\n    *   Final area (in 1999) = 3000 hectares.\n\n2.  **Calculate the increase in area:**\n    *   Increase = Final Value - Initial Value = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 hectares.\n\n3.  **Calculate the percentage increase:**\n    *   Percentage increase = (Increase / Initial Value) \u00d7 100\n    *   Percentage increase = (1800 / 1200) \u00d7 100 = 1.5 \u00d7 100 = 150%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in the area affected from 1976 to 1999 was 150%.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 40%**\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly dividing the initial value by the final value (1200 / 3000 = 0.4, or 40%).

This is a notable exception to the general rule in postnatal circulation, where veins carry deoxygenated blood towards the heart.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The role of preventing pathogens from passing to the fetus is a function of the placental barrier, not the umbilical vein.

The process begins with a diploid cell at a certain DNA mass. The mass then doubles; this represents the S phase of interphase, where DNA replication occurs in preparation for nuclear division. Following this, the cell maintains this doubled DNA mass through the G2 phase and the initial stages of nuclear division (prophase, metaphase, anaphase). Finally, the DNA mass is halved, returning to the original level. This halving event represents the separation of the cell into two daughter cells during telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nThis pattern is characteristic of **mitosis**. Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.

Discontinuous variation is usually caused by genes only.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Discontinuous variation is a type of variation that shows distinct, non-overlapping categories of phenotypes. For example, human blood groups are A, B, AB, or O, with no intermediate types. These traits are typically controlled by a single gene or a very small number of genes, and the environment has little to no effect on their expression. An individual's phenotype is determined solely by the alleles they inherit from their parents.\n\n### Rationale for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Continuous variation is usually caused by the environment only.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Continuous variation, which involves a complete range of phenotypes from one extreme to another (e.g., height, weight), is caused by the combined effects of both genetic and environmental factors. It is typically a polygenic trait, meaning it is controlled by multiple genes. While environmental factors like diet and lifestyle significantly influence the final phenotype, there is always an underlying genetic basis. The word \"only\" makes this statement false.\n\n**B. Continuous variation results in a limited range of phenotypes with no intermediates.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It mischaracterizes continuous variation. Continuous variation is defined by the presence of a wide spectrum of intermediate phenotypes between two extremes. For instance, human height does not fall into a few distinct categories; instead, it spans a continuous range. The description \"a limited range of phenotypes with no intermediates\" is the defining characteristic of discontinuous variation, not continuous variation.\n\n**D. Discontinuous variation results in a range of phenotypes between two extremes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It inaccurately describes discontinuous variation by applying the definition of continuous variation. Discontinuous variation results in a few distinct, separate, and non-overlapping phenotypic categories. It does not produce a continuous spectrum of intermediates between two extremes. For example, the ability to roll one's tongue is a discontinuous trait; a person either can or cannot do it, with no in-between ability."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_275.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "35 the photograph shows a water lily plant, which is a hydrophyte.\nne: i\nwhich statement explains why the stomata are located on the upper surface of the leaf?\na __ to allow carbon dioxide from the air to enter the leaf for use in photosynthesis\nb _ to allow carbon dioxide produced by photosynthesis to leave the leaf\nc__ to allow oxygen from the air to enter the leaf for use in photosynthesis\nd to allow oxygen from the water to enter the leaf for respiration", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nStomata are small pores on the surface of leaves that regulate gas exchange between the plant and the atmosphere. The primary function of these pores during the day is to allow carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) to diffuse from the air into the leaf. This CO\u2082 is an essential raw material for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce glucose for energy. A water lily is a hydrophyte with leaves that float on the water's surface. Because the underside of the leaf is in direct contact with water, gas exchange with the air is impossible from that surface. Therefore, the stomata are located on the upper surface of the leaf, which is exposed to the air, ensuring a constant supply of CO\u2082 for photosynthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect because photosynthesis is a process that *consumes* carbon dioxide, it does not produce it. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082. As shown, carbon dioxide is a reactant, and oxygen is a product. Carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration, not photosynthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the gases involved in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a key reactant to produce glucose. Oxygen is a *waste product* of photosynthesis that is released from the leaf through the stomata. While plants do take in oxygen for respiration, it is not used in the process of photosynthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the stomata are located on the *upper* surface of the leaf, which is in contact with the air, not the water. Therefore, they are adapted for gas exchange with the atmosphere, not the water. Secondly, while plants do require oxygen for respiration, the primary reason for the specific location of stomata on a water lily leaf is to maximize the intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, which occurs at a much higher rate than respiration during daylight hours."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_276.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "36 which term is used when humans cross individuals with desirable features?\na genetic breeding\nb natural breeding\nc_pure-breeding\nd selective breeding", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. selective breeding**\n\nSelective breeding, also known as artificial selection, is the process where humans intentionally choose organisms with specific desirable characteristics to reproduce. By repeatedly crossing individuals that exhibit these traits, the frequency of the corresponding alleles increases in the population over generations. This leads to the development of new breeds of animals or varieties of plants that are particularly suited for human uses, such as high-yield crops, docile domestic animals, or disease-resistant plants. The core principle is human intervention to guide the evolutionary path of a species for a desired outcome.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. genetic breeding**\nThis is not a standard scientific term and is less precise than \"selective breeding.\" It could be misinterpreted as genetic engineering, which is a different process involving the direct manipulation of an organism's DNA in a laboratory. Selective breeding, in contrast, works with whole organisms and relies on the principles of inheritance through sexual reproduction, without directly altering the genetic code.\n\n**B. natural breeding**\nThis term implies a process without human intervention, such as natural selection. In natural selection, environmental pressures determine which individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits.

By cultivating a single crop species over a large, uniform area, farmers can employ specialised, mechanised techniques for planting, irrigation, fertilisation, pest control, and harvesting. This mechanisation and standardisation lead to high levels of efficiency and allow for the optimisation of growing conditions for that particular crop. As a result, the amount of crop produced per unit area (the yield) is maximised, which is a primary economic and productive advantage of this agricultural system.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) Biodiversity is increased.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Monoculture involves replacing a natural ecosystem, which contains a wide variety of plant species, with a single crop species. This action drastically reduces plant diversity. Consequently, the variety of habitats and food sources for other organisms, such as insects, birds, and mammals, is also severely diminished, leading to a significant decrease, not an increase, in overall biodiversity. This loss of biodiversity is a major disadvantage of monoculture.\n\n**B) Genetic variation is increased.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Large-scale monocultures typically rely on a single, selectively bred variety of a crop chosen for its high yield and other desirable traits. These plants are often genetically uniform or identical (clones). This practice leads to a sharp decrease in the genetic variation within the crop population compared to the diversity found in wild relatives or traditional mixed-crop systems. The lack of genetic variation makes the entire crop highly vulnerable to new diseases or pests.\n\n**C) Water use is increased.**\nWhile it is often true that large-scale monocultures require significant amounts of water for irrigation, leading to increased water use, this is not considered an advantage. The question asks for an advantage of the practice. Increased consumption of a natural resource like water is an environmental and economic cost, and is therefore a disadvantage, particularly in regions where water is scarce. It can lead to the depletion of aquifers and other negative environmental impacts."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_279.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "39 yeast can produce carbon dioxide and ethanol.\nwhat can be made using these products?\n| stersoale [ater\na biofuel washing powder\nb washing powder fruit juice\ncc fruit juice bread\nd bread biofuel", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nYeast performs anaerobic respiration, a process also known as fermentation.

The ethanol produced by the fermentation of plant sugars (such as from sugarcane or corn) is widely used as a renewable biofuel.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. Biofuel is produced from ethanol, not carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a product of combustion when biofuel is burned; it is not the fuel itself.

The process of genetically modifying bacteria to produce a human protein involves several sequential steps. The very first step is to identify the specific human gene that codes for the desired protein and isolate it from the rest of the human DNA. This is achieved using specific enzymes, called restriction enzymes, to cut the gene out of the human chromosome.

It is the process by which metabolic waste products\u2014substances that are toxic or are in excess of the body's requirements\u2014are removed from an organism. All living things carry out metabolic reactions, such as respiration, to release energy. These chemical reactions invariably produce waste products (e.g., carbon dioxide, urea). The accumulation of these substances would be harmful, so every organism, from a single-celled bacterium to a complex animal, must have a mechanism to excrete them to maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. breathing**\nBreathing is the mechanical process of taking in air (inhalation) and expelling it (exhalation), which facilitates gas exchange in organisms with lungs or similar respiratory organs. While many animals breathe, it is not a universal characteristic. For instance, plants and algae perform gas exchange through structures like stomata, but they do not breathe. Many microorganisms and anaerobic organisms do not require oxygen and therefore do not breathe.\n\n**C. photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (glucose) and release oxygen. This process is exclusive to autotrophs (producers). Animals, fungi, and many bacteria are heterotrophs, meaning they cannot produce their own food and must obtain energy by consuming other organisms. Therefore, photosynthesis is not a characteristic of all living things.\n\n**D. tropism**\nTropism is a directional growth response of an organism, typically a plant, towards or away from an external stimulus like light (phototropism) or gravity (geotropism). While responding to stimuli (sensitivity or irritability) is a characteristic of all life, tropism specifically refers to a growth-based response. This is primarily seen in plants and other sessile (non-moving) organisms. Animals, being motile, typically respond to stimuli with movement rather than directional growth."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_282.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "2 ~~ what kind of skin do amphibians have?\na dry without scales\nb_ dry with scales\nc moist without scales\nd_ moist with scales", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAmphibian skin is characteristically moist and lacks scales. The skin contains numerous mucus glands that secrete a slimy coating, which keeps the surface moist. This moisture is crucial for cutaneous respiration, a form of gas exchange that occurs through the skin. Oxygen from the air or water dissolves in this moist layer and diffuses across the thin, permeable skin into a dense network of underlying blood capillaries. This process supplements the gas exchange that occurs in their simple lungs. The absence of scales is a key feature that allows the skin to be an efficient respiratory surface.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) dry without scales**\nThis is incorrect. While amphibians do lack scales, their skin must remain moist for survival. Dry skin would prevent cutaneous respiration, as gases like oxygen need to dissolve in a liquid before they can diffuse across a membrane. If an amphibian's skin were to dry out, it would essentially suffocate.\n\n**B) dry with scales**\nThis describes the skin of reptiles (e.g., lizards, snakes, crocodiles). Reptiles have evolved dry, scaly skin as an adaptation to a fully terrestrial life. The keratin scales create a waterproof barrier that prevents water loss (desiccation) and provides protection. This is fundamentally different from the permeable, moist skin of amphibians.\n\n**D) moist with scales**\nThis describes the skin of most fish. Fish live in an aquatic environment, and their skin is kept moist by their surroundings and a layer of mucus. They are typically covered in scales, which offer protection from predators and physical damage.

This means that a shorter distance for particles to travel results in a faster rate of diffusion. Molecules can cross from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration more quickly when the barrier is thinner. Biological gas exchange surfaces, such as the walls of the alveoli and capillaries in the lungs, are extremely thin (often only one cell thick) to minimise the diffusion distance and maximise the rate of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a decrease in the concentration gradient**\nThe rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the steepness of the concentration gradient. A steep gradient (a large difference in concentration) drives faster net movement of molecules. A decrease in the concentration gradient would reduce the driving force for diffusion, causing the rate to slow down, not increase.\n\n**C. a decrease in the kinetic energy of molecules**\nThe kinetic energy of molecules is related to their speed of movement, which is determined by temperature. A decrease in kinetic energy means the molecules are moving more slowly. Since diffusion relies on the random motion of particles, slower-moving particles will diffuse at a lower rate. An increase in kinetic energy (i.e., higher temperature) is required to increase the rate of diffusion.\n\n**D. a decrease in the surface area of the gas exchange surface**\nThe rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the surface area over which it occurs. A larger surface area provides more space for molecules to pass through, increasing the total number of particles that can diffuse in a given time.

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through a partially permeable membrane.\n\nPure water has the highest possible water potential (defined as zero). The cytoplasm and vacuolar sap inside potato plant cells contain dissolved solutes like sugars and salts, which lowers their water potential, making it negative.\n\nWhen potato cells are placed in pure water, a steep water potential gradient is established between the outside and the inside of the cells. Consequently, water moves by osmosis from the pure water (higher water potential) into the potato cells (lower water potential).\n\nAs water enters the cell vacuole and cytoplasm, they swell and push the cell membrane against the strong, inelastic cellulose cell wall.

Water enters the cells and they become plasmolysed.**\nWhile it is correct that water enters the cells, the outcome is incorrect. Plasmolysis is the condition where the cell membrane and cytoplasm shrink and pull away from the cell wall due to a significant loss of water. This occurs when a plant cell is placed in a solution with a much lower water potential (a hypertonic solution), not in pure water.\n\n**C. Water leaves the cells and they become plasmolysed.**\nWater would only leave the cells if the external solution had a lower water potential than the cell's cytoplasm. Since pure water has a higher water potential than the potato cells, water will move into, not out of, the cells.

It consists of a short hydrocarbon chain and a terminal carboxyl group (\u2014COOH). While it possesses a carboxyl group, which is one of the functional groups found in an amino acid, it lacks the essential amino group (\u2014NH\u2082).

A decrease in the time required to complete the reaction signifies that the reaction is proceeding more quickly. Therefore, the rate of reaction increases as the temperature rises from X to Y. This is because increasing the temperature provides more kinetic energy to both the enzyme and substrate molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions and a higher rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The optimum temperature is at X and the rate of reaction decreases between X and Y.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the optimum temperature is not at X. At point X, the time taken for the reaction is high, indicating a low rate of reaction. The optimum temperature corresponds to the maximum reaction rate, which occurs at Y.

The surface area of the food is increased.**\n\nChewing, also known as mastication, is the process of mechanical digestion in the mouth. It involves the teeth cutting and grinding food into smaller pieces. This physical breakdown does not change the chemical nature of the food, but it dramatically increases the total surface area of the food particles. Digestive enzymes, which are responsible for chemical digestion, can only act on the surface of these particles. By increasing the surface area, chewing allows these enzymes (such as amylase in the saliva and subsequent enzymes in the stomach and small intestine) to access the food more efficiently and simultaneously. This leads to a much faster rate of chemical breakdown, thus speeding up the overall process of digestion.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. Bacteria in the food are killed.**\nWhile saliva does contain an enzyme called lysozyme which has some antibacterial properties, this is not the primary reason chewing speeds up digestion. The main site for killing harmful microorganisms in food is the stomach, where the highly acidic environment (due to hydrochloric acid) effectively sterilises the food. Furthermore, the act of killing bacteria is a protective measure, not a process that accelerates the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which is the core function of digestion.\n\n**B. Food is mixed with protease.**\nDuring chewing, food is mixed with saliva. Saliva contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of starch (a carbohydrate) into simpler sugars like maltose. Proteases are enzymes that specifically break down proteins. Protease is not found in saliva; protein digestion begins in the stomach with the enzyme pepsin and continues in the small intestine with enzymes like trypsin.\n\n**D. The taste of food is improved.**\nChewing does enhance the perception of taste because breaking down the food releases more chemical molecules that can dissolve in saliva and stimulate the taste buds on the tongue. However, this is a sensory experience. While pleasant tastes can stimulate the production of more saliva, the improvement of taste itself is not the direct mechanism that speeds up the chemical reactions of digestion. The acceleration is due to the physical change in the food (increased surface area), not the sensory perception of it."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_294.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "14 which substances are produced by the action of amylase on starch?\na_ amino acids\nb fatty acids and glycerol\nc ssalts\nd sugars", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nStarch is a large, complex carbohydrate molecule (a polysaccharide) made up of long chains of glucose units. Amylase is a digestive enzyme that specifically catalyses the breakdown of starch. This enzymatic reaction, known as hydrolysis, breaks the chemical bonds linking the glucose units together. The result is the formation of smaller, simpler, soluble sugar molecules, primarily the disaccharide maltose, which can be further broken down into the monosaccharide glucose.

The two main structures responsible for these changes are the diaphragm (3) and the rib cage, which is moved by the intercostal muscles (1).\n\nDuring inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, while the external intercostal muscles contract to lift the rib cage upwards and outwards. Both of these actions increase the volume of the thoracic cavity. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure inside the lungs relative to the atmospheric pressure, causing air to flow into the lungs.\n\nDuring exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and returns to its dome shape, and the external intercostal muscles relax, allowing the rib cage to move downwards and inwards. These movements decrease the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the pressure inside the lungs above atmospheric pressure and forcing air out. Therefore, both the rib cage (1) and the diaphragm (3) are essential for producing the volume and pressure changes of ventilation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. 1 only:** This option is incorrect because it omits the role of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the primary muscle of respiration, and its movement is responsible for a significant portion of the volume change in the thoracic cavity during quiet breathing. While the rib cage (1) is also crucial, ventilation relies on the coordinated action of both the rib cage and the diaphragm.\n\n**C. 2 and 3:** This option is incorrect because it includes the trachea (2). The trachea is a rigid tube, reinforced with cartilage rings, that serves as the main airway connecting the larynx to the bronchi. Its function is to conduct air to and from the lungs. It is a passive structure in the mechanics of breathing and does not contract or move to change the volume of the thoracic cavity.\n\n**D. 2 and 4:** This option is incorrect because it identifies the trachea (2) and the bronchi/bronchioles (4) as the structures responsible for ventilation mechanics. Both the trachea and the bronchi/bronchioles are parts of the respiratory tract's conducting zone. They function as passageways for air to travel to the alveoli for gas exchange but do not actively participate in changing the volume and pressure of the thoracic cavity."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_302.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "22 the graph shows the lactic acid concentration in the blood during exercise and during recovery\nafter exercise.\n1.0\nz\nblood lactic acid\nconcentration 0.5\n/mgdm*\nea exercise \u2014\u2014\u00bb|\u00ab\u2014\u2014_ recovery \u2014\u2014\u00bb\n\u201c0 5 10 15 20 25 30\ntime / minutes\nwhich process accounts for the shape of the graph at z?\na aerobic respiration of lactic acid in the kidney\nb aerobic respiration of lactic acid in the liver\nc_ anaerobic respiration of lactic acid in the kidney\nd_ anaerobic respiration of lactic acid in the liver", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nDuring strenuous exercise, the body's demand for energy exceeds the oxygen supply to the muscles. This leads to anaerobic respiration, where glucose is partially broken down into lactic acid to release a small amount of energy. After exercise, during the recovery period, this accumulated lactic acid must be removed. It is transported by the blood from the muscles to the liver. In the liver, in the presence of oxygen (which is why breathing rate remains high after exercise, to repay the 'oxygen debt'), the lactic acid is converted back to pyruvate. This pyruvate is then completely oxidised through aerobic respiration to release a large amount of energy, or it can be converted into glucose and stored as glycogen. This aerobic breakdown of lactic acid in the liver causes its concentration in the blood to decrease, as shown by the downward slope at Z.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. aerobic respiration of lactic acid in the kidney**\nThis option is incorrect because although the breakdown of lactic acid is an aerobic process, the primary organ responsible for metabolising the majority of lactic acid from the blood is the liver, not the kidney. While the kidneys and heart muscle can metabolise some lactate, the liver plays the principal role in clearing it after intense exercise.\n\n**C. anaerobic respiration of lactic acid in the kidney**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, lactic acid is a product of anaerobic respiration, not a substance that is broken down by it. The breakdown of lactic acid is an aerobic process that requires oxygen. Secondly, as explained above, the main site for this metabolic process is the liver, not the kidney.\n\n**D. anaerobic respiration of lactic acid in the liver**\nThis option correctly identifies the liver as the primary site for lactic acid metabolism but incorrectly describes the process. The breakdown of lactic acid is an oxygen-dependent (aerobic) process, which is part of repaying the oxygen debt incurred during exercise.

As this filtrate travels through the nephron, particularly in the proximal convoluted tubule, essential substances are returned to the blood. All the glucose is selectively reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the capillaries surrounding the nephron via active transport. This is a crucial process to conserve valuable nutrients and prevent them from being lost in the urine. In a healthy individual, urine should not contain any glucose.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: production of amino acids**\nAmino acids are not produced within the nephron. They are obtained through the digestion of proteins and are transported in the blood. Like glucose, amino acids are small molecules that are filtered out of the blood in the glomerulus. They are then almost completely reabsorbed back into the blood in the proximal convoluted tubule because they are essential for protein synthesis and other metabolic processes. The nephron's role is to conserve amino acids, not to produce them.\n\n**B: excretion of oxygen**\nOxygen is transported by haemoglobin in red blood cells and is vital for aerobic respiration in all body cells, including the cells of the kidney. It is not a metabolic waste product to be excreted. The excretory system's primary function is to remove metabolic wastes like urea and excess salts and water. Gaseous exchange, including the removal of the waste gas carbon dioxide, occurs in the lungs.\n\n**C: production of urea**\nUrea is not produced in the nephron. It is synthesised in the liver through a process called deamination, where excess amino acids are broken down. The liver converts the resulting highly toxic ammonia into the less toxic urea. Urea is then released into the bloodstream, transported to the kidneys, and filtered from the blood at the glomerulus to be excreted as a component of urine.

This is achieved by widening the pupil, a process called dilation. Pupil dilation is controlled by the antagonistic action of two sets of muscles in the iris. The radial muscles, arranged like spokes on a wheel, contract. This contraction pulls the inner edge of the iris outwards, enlarging the pupil. Simultaneously, the circular muscles, which encircle the pupil, relax. This relaxation allows the radial muscles to effectively widen the pupil. Therefore, in a dark room, the pupil dilates due to the contraction of radial muscles and the relaxation of circular muscles.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the pupil constricts. Pupil constriction is the response to bright light, not dim light, as its purpose is to limit the amount of light entering the eye. While the listed muscle actions (radial muscles contract, circular muscles relax) are correct for causing pupil dilation, they are incorrectly matched with pupil constriction, making this option internally inconsistent and incorrect for the given scenario.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option describes the physiological response to moving from a dark room into bright light, which is the opposite of the situation presented. In bright light, the pupil constricts (gets smaller) to protect the retina from excessive light. This constriction is caused by the contraction of the circular muscles and the relaxation of the radial muscles. Since the question describes moving into a dark room, this set of responses is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the pupil dilates in a dark room but incorrectly describes the muscle actions required to achieve this. Pupil dilation requires the radial muscles to contract and the circular muscles to relax. This option states the opposite: that the radial muscles relax and the circular muscles contract. The contraction of circular muscles would cause the pupil to constrict, directly opposing the dilation needed in low light.

Adrenaline causes more glycogen to be converted to glucose.**\n\nAdrenaline is a hormone released in response to stress or excitement, preparing the body for \"fight or flight\". A key part of this response is to rapidly increase the amount of available energy for cells, particularly muscle cells. The main source of this energy is glucose. Adrenaline acts on liver cells, stimulating the breakdown of the stored polysaccharide, glycogen, into glucose molecules. This process is called glycogenolysis. The glucose is then released from the liver into the bloodstream, causing a rapid increase in blood glucose concentration. This provides the body's tissues with the extra fuel needed for increased metabolic activity.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Adrenaline causes less glucose to be converted to glucagon.**\n\nThis statement is biologically incorrect. Glucose is a simple sugar used for energy, while glucagon is a protein hormone produced by the pancreas. Glucose is not converted into glucagon. Glucagon's function is to raise blood glucose levels, but it is not formed from glucose.\n\n**B. Adrenaline causes less glucagon to be converted to glucose.**\n\nThis statement is also biologically incorrect. Glucagon is a hormone that signals the liver to break down glycogen; it is not a storage molecule that can be converted into glucose. Hormones act as chemical messengers to trigger cellular processes, but they are not themselves converted into the products of those processes.\n\n**C. Adrenaline causes more glucose to be converted to glycogen.**\n\nThe conversion of glucose into glycogen is a process called glycogenesis. This process stores excess glucose, thereby *decreasing* the concentration of glucose in the blood. This effect is opposite to what is required in a \"fight-or-flight\" situation and is contrary to the observed rise in blood glucose levels. The hormone primarily responsible for stimulating glycogenesis is insulin, which is typically released when blood glucose levels are high, such as after a meal."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_306.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "26 which statement about insulin is correct?\n\na insulin is produced by the liver when the blood glucose concentration is high. its target cells\nare in the pancreas.\n\nb insulin is produced by the liver when the blood glucose concentration is low. its target cells\nare in the pancreas.\n\nc insulin is produced by the pancreas when the blood glucose concentration is high. its target\ncells are in the liver.\n\nd insulin is produced by the pancreas when the blood glucose concentration is low. its target\ncells are in the liver.", "Chapter": 14, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement accurately describes the function of insulin in blood glucose regulation. Insulin is a hormone produced by the \u03b2-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The secretion of insulin is stimulated by an increase in blood glucose concentration, a condition known as hyperglycemia, which typically occurs after consuming a carbohydrate-rich meal. Once released into the bloodstream, insulin travels to its target cells, primarily in the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue. It binds to receptors on these cells, signalling them to increase their uptake of glucose from the blood. Specifically in the liver, insulin stimulates the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage. This entire process effectively lowers the blood glucose level, returning it to its normal homeostatic range.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Insulin is produced by the liver when the blood glucose concentration is high. Its target cells are in the pancreas.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, insulin is produced by the pancreas, not the liver. The liver is a major target organ for insulin, but it does not produce the hormone. Secondly, while the pancreas produces insulin, it is not the primary target for insulin's glucose-lowering action. The main target organs are the liver and muscle cells.\n\n**B. Insulin is produced by the liver when the blood glucose concentration is low. Its target cells are in the pancreas.**\nThis statement contains multiple inaccuracies. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, not the liver. Furthermore, insulin is secreted in response to *high* blood glucose levels, not low. Low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) stimulates the pancreas to release a different hormone called glucagon. Finally, the primary target cells for insulin are in the liver and muscles, not the pancreas.\n\n**D. Insulin is produced by the pancreas when the blood glucose concentration is low. Its target cells are in the liver.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it identifies the wrong stimulus for insulin release. While it correctly states that insulin is produced by the pancreas and acts on the liver, it incorrectly claims this occurs when blood glucose is low. Insulin's function is to *lower* blood glucose, so it is released when blood glucose levels are high. When blood glucose is low, the pancreas secretes glucagon, which acts on the liver to release glucose into the blood."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_307.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "27 what is a function of the placenta?\na acts as a barrier to prevent some toxins reaching the fetus\nb_ exchanges blood between the mother and the fetus\nc prevents the transfer of excretory products from the fetus\nd protects the fetus from mechanical damage", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nThe placenta functions as a selective barrier between the mother's and the fetus's blood. While it facilitates the transport of essential nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, it also prevents many harmful substances, such as certain pathogens and toxins, from passing from the mother's blood to the fetal circulation. This protective function is crucial for healthy fetal development. However, it is important to note that this barrier is not impenetrable; some harmful substances, including alcohol, nicotine, certain drugs, and viruses like rubella, can cross the placenta and harm the fetus.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **B is incorrect** because there is no direct exchange or mixing of blood between the mother and the fetus. The maternal and fetal circulatory systems are separate. The exchange of substances (like nutrients, gases, and waste products) occurs via diffusion across the thin membranes of the chorionic villi, where the fetal capillaries are in close proximity to the maternal blood pools. This separation prevents the mother's immune system from rejecting the fetus and protects against potential issues from different blood types.\n\n*   **C is incorrect** because a primary function of the placenta is the opposite of what is stated. The placenta is essential for the removal of metabolic waste products, such as urea and carbon dioxide, from the fetal blood. These excretory products diffuse across the placenta into the mother's bloodstream, where her organs (kidneys and lungs) process and excrete them. Therefore, the placenta facilitates, rather than prevents, the transfer of excretory products from the fetus.\n\n*   **D is incorrect** because the primary structure that protects the fetus from mechanical damage is the amniotic sac filled with amniotic fluid.

In environments where water is scarce, such as deserts, minimising water loss is critical for survival. Desert plants have evolved numerous adaptations to reduce the rate of transpiration, such as having a thick, waxy cuticle, a reduced number of stomata, or leaves modified into spines. By reducing transpiration, these plants can conserve the limited water they absorb from the soil, thus enabling them to survive prolonged periods of drought.\n\n---\n### Rationale for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. translocation**\n\nTranslocation is the transport of soluble organic substances, such as sucrose, within a plant. This process occurs in the phloem tissue and moves sugars from the source (usually the leaves where photosynthesis occurs) to the sink (parts of the plant that require energy, like roots, fruits, and growing tips). Translocation is essential for distributing energy and nutrients throughout the plant. While water is involved as the solvent in phloem sap, translocation itself is not a process of water loss to the environment. Reducing this process would hinder the plant's ability to nourish itself, rather than help it retain water.\n\n**C. respiration**\n\nCellular respiration is the metabolic process that breaks down glucose to release energy in the form of ATP, which powers all cellular activities. This process is fundamental to the survival of all living organisms, including plants. Respiration occurs continuously in all living cells. It is not a mechanism of significant water loss; in fact, it is a process that produces a small amount of metabolic water. Reducing respiration would deprive the plant of the essential energy needed to live and would not be a viable strategy for water conservation.\n\n**D. digestion**\n\nDigestion is the process of breaking down large, complex food molecules into smaller, simpler ones that can be absorbed and used by an organism.

While plants do break down stored food reserves (like starch into glucose), this is typically referred to as hydrolysis and is an internal metabolic process. It is not related to water loss to the external environment.

This sequence places the mutation (4) at the end. Antibiotics act as a selective agent on pre-existing variation; they do not cause the specific mutation for resistance. The mutation must be present in the population before the antibiotic is used for selection to occur. Furthermore, survival (3) must logically precede reproduction (2), as an organism cannot reproduce if it has not survived.\n\n**B: 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 4** is incorrect. This sequence is not logical. It begins with antibiotic-resistant bacteria reproducing (2), but there would be no selective advantage for this trait to become prominent before the introduction of the antibiotic (1), which acts as the selection pressure. As with option A, the mutation (4) is incorrectly placed at the end of the process, whereas it is the initial source of the resistance trait.\n\n**C: 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 2** is incorrect. This sequence incorrectly starts with the survival of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (3). Survival can only occur in response to a selection pressure, in this case, the introduction of the antibiotic (1). Therefore, event 1 must happen before event 3.

In the year 2000, the most common beak length (the mode, represented by the tallest bar) was relatively short. In 2020, the entire distribution has shifted to the right, and the most common beak length is now longer. This indicates an overall **increase** in the average beak length of the population.\n\nThe question specifies that this is a **wild** bird population. Changes in the traits of a wild population over time are driven by **natural selection**. This process occurs when environmental pressures (such as changes in food availability, climate, or predators) favour certain individuals with specific heritable traits. These individuals are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring. In this case, birds with longer beaks had a selective advantage, leading to an increase in the frequency of this trait in the population. This specific pattern, where one extreme phenotype is favoured, is known as directional selection.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decrease, artificial**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the graphs show a shift towards longer beaks, indicating an increase, not a decrease, in average beak length. Secondly, artificial selection involves humans deliberately breeding organisms for desired traits. Since the population is described as \"wild,\" the selection pressure is environmental, not human-induced.\n\n**B: decrease, natural**\nThis option correctly identifies the process as natural selection, as the population is wild. However, it incorrectly states that the beak length has decreased. The graphical data clearly shows that the distribution of beak lengths has shifted towards the longer end of the scale, indicating an increase in the average beak length.\n\n**C: increase, artificial**\nThis option correctly identifies that the average beak length has increased. However, it incorrectly attributes this change to artificial selection. Artificial selection is a process guided by human intervention.

Producers, such as plants and algae, capture light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy in the form of organic molecules (like glucose) through the process of photosynthesis. This chemical energy is then transferred through the different trophic levels of the ecosystem as organisms consume one another. Therefore, all the energy available to consumers and decomposers in a food chain originally entered the ecosystem as sunlight.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. decomposers**\nDecomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, obtain energy by breaking down the dead organic matter of other organisms from all trophic levels. While they play a vital role in recycling nutrients, they are not the primary source of energy. The energy they release from decomposition was originally captured from the sun by producers and then transferred through the food chain. Decomposers are at the end of the energy flow pathway, not the beginning.\n\n**B. herbivores**\nHerbivores are primary consumers that obtain their energy by eating producers (plants). The energy they acquire is the chemical energy that the plants stored during photosynthesis. Therefore, herbivores are a step in the transfer of energy through the ecosystem, but they are not the original source of that energy. Their energy ultimately comes from the Sun, via the producers they consume.\n\n**C. producers**\nProducers, or autotrophs, are the organisms that form the base of the food chain. They are fundamentally important because they are the entry point for energy into the ecosystem. However, they are energy *converters*, not the energy *source*.

This order accurately reflects the cause-and-effect chain that characterises this ecological process.\n\n1.  **Increase in nitrate ions (2):** The process begins with the enrichment of a body of water with nutrients, such as nitrates and phosphates. This is often caused by runoff from agricultural fertilisers or discharge of untreated sewage.\n2.  **Growth of producers (4):** The excess nitrates act as a fertiliser, stimulating the rapid and excessive growth of aquatic producers, primarily algae and cyanobacteria. This event is known as an algal bloom.\n3.  **Death of producers followed by their decomposition (6):** The dense layer of algae on the surface blocks sunlight from reaching submerged plants, causing them to die. The algae in the bloom also have short lifespans and die in large numbers as they exhaust the nutrient supply or due to overcrowding.\n4.  **Increased aerobic respiration by decomposers (5):** The large quantity of dead organic matter (dead producers) provides a food source for a massive population of decomposers, such as aerobic bacteria and fungi. As these decomposers break down the organic material, their population and rate of aerobic respiration increase dramatically.\n5.  **Reduction in dissolved oxygen (1):** The high rate of aerobic respiration by the decomposers consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen from the water, leading to a significant depletion of oxygen levels. This condition is known as hypoxia (low oxygen) or anoxia (no oxygen).\n6.  **Death of organisms requiring dissolved oxygen (3):** The severely reduced levels of dissolved oxygen are insufficient to support other aerobic aquatic life. Organisms such as fish, insects, and crustaceans die from suffocation.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A (1 \u2192 3 \u2192 5 \u2192 2 \u2192 6 \u2192 4):** This sequence is incorrect because it starts with a reduction in dissolved oxygen (1), which is a consequence of eutrophication, not its starting point.

Lignin can be produced as rapidly as it is removed from the environment.**\n\nA sustainable resource is defined as a resource that can be replenished or renewed at a rate equal to or greater than the rate at which it is consumed. This ensures that the resource will not be depleted over time. Lignin is a polymer found in plants. Since plants can be grown and harvested (a process that occurs within a human timescale), the supply of lignin is renewable. Therefore, bioplastics made from lignin are considered sustainable because the raw material, lignin, can be produced by growing new plants as it is used, fitting the definition of a sustainable resource.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Lignin is found in xylem tissue.**\n\nThis statement is factually correct; lignin is a key structural component of xylem, providing rigidity and support to the plant. However, the location of a substance within an organism does not determine its sustainability. Sustainability is concerned with the renewability of the resource, not its specific biological origin or location.\n\n**C. Lignin is strong.**\n\nWhile it is true that lignin is a strong and rigid polymer, which makes it a useful material for bioplastics, its strength is a physical property. The physical characteristics of a material are distinct from the concept of its sustainability. Many strong materials, such as those derived from minerals or fossil fuels, are non-renewable and therefore not sustainable.\n\n**D. Lignin is waterproof.**\n\nThe waterproof (hydrophobic) nature of lignin is another of its important physical properties, crucial for its function in plant xylem. However, like strength, this property does not relate to whether the resource is sustainable. Sustainability is determined by whether the resource can be replenished, not by its physical attributes. For example, conventional plastics derived from petroleum are also waterproof, but they are not sustainable because crude oil is a finite, non-renewable resource."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_319.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "39 which bacterial cell structure is useful in genetic modification?\na cell membrane\nb cell wall\nc_ cytoplasm\nd plasmid", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nA plasmid is a small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecule found in the cytoplasm of many bacteria. In genetic modification (also known as genetic engineering), plasmids are used as **vectors**\u2014vehicles for carrying foreign DNA into a host cell. Scientists can isolate plasmids from bacteria, use specific **restriction enzymes** to cut the plasmid open, and then insert a gene of interest (e.g., the human gene for insulin) into the plasmid. This creates what is known as **recombinant DNA**. The modified plasmid is then reintroduced into host bacteria. As these bacteria reproduce rapidly, they also replicate the plasmid, thereby cloning the inserted gene. The bacteria can then express this gene to produce the desired protein. This central role as a carrier of genetic information makes the plasmid an essential tool in genetic modification.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: cell membrane**\nThe cell membrane's primary function is to control the passage of substances into and out of the cell. While it plays a role in the process of genetic modification\u2014it must be made temporarily permeable to allow the recombinant plasmid to enter the bacterium\u2014the cell membrane itself is not the structure that is modified or used to carry the new genetic material. It is a boundary to be crossed, not the vehicle for the gene.\n\n**B: cell wall**\nThe cell wall provides structural support and protection to the bacterial cell. Like the cell membrane, it is a barrier that must be overcome for a plasmid to enter the cell. However, it does not contain genetic information that can be manipulated, nor is it used to transport genes. Its function is purely structural and protective, not genetic.\n\n**C: cytoplasm**\nThe cytoplasm is the internal environment of the cell where metabolic reactions occur. Once a recombinant plasmid enters a bacterium, it resides and replicates within the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the cell's machinery for protein synthesis (ribosomes), located in the cytoplasm, is used to express the new gene. However, the cytoplasm is the site of these activities, not the specific structure used to introduce and carry the foreign genetic information.

Within any large population of weeds, there is natural genetic variation. By chance, a few individual weeds may possess a random mutation that confers some degree of resistance to the herbicide. When the herbicide is applied, non-resistant weeds are killed, while the resistant individuals survive and reproduce. They pass the gene for resistance to their offspring. Over subsequent generations and repeated applications of the same herbicide, the frequency of this resistance gene increases throughout the weed population. This process of natural selection can lead to the evolution of \"superweeds\" that are no longer controlled by the herbicide, which is a significant disadvantage for farmers.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **A: The loss of weeds reduces competition.** This statement describes an advantage, not a disadvantage. Weeds compete with crop plants for essential resources such as sunlight, water, and soil nutrients. By using a herbicide to eliminate weeds, competition is reduced, allowing the genetically modified crop to grow more vigorously and access more resources. This is one of the primary intended benefits of this technology.\n\n*   **C: The crop plant is unharmed and produces a higher yield.** This statement describes the main advantage and the reason for developing a herbicide-resistant crop. The genetic modification allows the crop plant to remain unaffected by the herbicide, while competing weeds are destroyed. The resulting decrease in competition typically leads to a healthier crop and a greater harvest (higher yield), which is a clear benefit to the farmer.\n\n*   **D: The new gene will appear in new generations of the crop plant.** This is an essential and intended feature of a genetically modified crop, not a disadvantage.

A dilute salt solution has a high concentration of water molecules (high water potential) and a low concentration of solute (salt). Conversely, the cytoplasm and vacuole of the plant cell contain salts, sugars, and other solutes, resulting in a lower water potential. When the cell is placed in the dilute solution, a water potential gradient is established. Consequently, water moves by osmosis from the surrounding solution into the cell. This influx of water causes the vacuole to swell and push the cell membrane firmly against the rigid cell wall, leading to the cell becoming turgid, as shown in the second diagram.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The primary and most significant change observed is the increase in cell volume and turgidity, which is caused by the movement of water, not salts. While some movement of salt ions by diffusion might occur, osmosis, the movement of water, is the process that accounts for the cell swelling. Diffusion of salts into the cell would not cause the substantial increase in turgor pressure seen.\n\n**B:** Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. The external solution is described as dilute, meaning it has a lower concentration of salts than the cell's cytoplasm.

However, this is not the primary process, and salts would tend to move into the cell, down their concentration gradient, not out.\n\n**D:** Water leaves a cell by osmosis when the external solution has a lower water potential (i.e., is more concentrated) than the cell's interior. This process, known as plasmolysis, would cause the vacuole to shrink and the cell membrane to pull away from the cell wall, making the cell flaccid.

Mitochondria are the organelles where the majority of aerobic respiration takes place. Therefore, a large number of mitochondria are required to produce sufficient ATP to fuel the active transport of nitrate ions.\n2.  **Oxygen:** Aerobic respiration requires oxygen as a reactant to release a large amount of energy from glucose, producing a high yield of ATP. Without a sufficient supply of oxygen, the rate of aerobic respiration would decrease, leading to a reduction in ATP production and, consequently, a slower rate of nitrate ion absorption.\n3.  **Membrane proteins:** Active transport is facilitated by specific carrier proteins (also called transporter proteins) embedded within the cell surface membrane.

Benedict's solution is initially a clear blue colour due to the presence of copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a). When this solution is heated with a sample containing a reducing sugar, the sugar donates electrons to the copper(II) ions, reducing them to copper(I) ions (Cu\u207a). These copper(I) ions then form an insoluble precipitate of copper(I) oxide (Cu\u2082O).\n\nThe colour of the precipitate, and thus the solution, changes depending on the concentration of the reducing sugar. A low concentration produces a green precipitate, a moderate concentration produces a yellow or orange precipitate, and a high concentration results in a brick-red precipitate.

Its primary role is the chemical digestion and absorption of most nutrients. To facilitate the absorption of these dissolved nutrients, a vast amount of water is also absorbed from the digestive tract into the bloodstream by osmosis. The small intestine has a very large surface area, due to its length and the presence of numerous folds called villi and microvilli, which makes it highly efficient at absorption.

The active site is a particular region on the enzyme with a shape and chemical properties that are precisely tailored to bind to a specific molecule, the substrate. This relationship is described as complementary, similar to how a key is complementary to its lock. The substrate fits into the active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This binding allows the enzyme to catalyse the conversion of the substrate into products. This specificity ensures that each enzyme typically acts on only one type of substrate, enabling precise control over metabolic pathways in a cell.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. The active site of an enzyme has the same shape as the substrate.**\nThis statement is incorrect. If the active site and the substrate had the exact same shape, they would not be able to bind together. For binding to occur, the two shapes must fit together, meaning they are complementary. For example, a depression (part of the active site) fits a protrusion (part of the substrate). This complementary fit is essential for the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex.\n\n**B. The active site is not affected by changes in temperature.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Enzymes are proteins, and their three-dimensional structure, including the shape of the active site, is held in place by weak bonds. High temperatures increase the kinetic energy of the enzyme's atoms, causing them to vibrate. If the temperature becomes too high, these vibrations can break the bonds that maintain the active site's specific shape. This irreversible change in shape is called denaturation, and it renders the enzyme non-functional because the substrate can no longer bind to the altered active site.\n\n**D. The substrate and product combine at the active site.**\nThis statement misrepresents the process of an enzyme-catalysed reaction. The substrate is the reactant molecule that binds to the active site. The enzyme then facilitates a chemical reaction that transforms the substrate into the product(s). The product(s) are then released from the active site, freeing the enzyme to catalyse another reaction.

However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is increased from 0.04% to 0.10% (while keeping the light intensity constant at the level of point X), the graph shows that the rate of photosynthesis increases significantly (as seen on the higher curve).

This indicates that the rate of photosynthesis has reached a plateau at this specific carbon dioxide concentration. Any further increase in light intensity (moving to the right along the x-axis) does not result in a corresponding increase in the rate of photosynthesis.

Amylase is an enzyme that digests carbohydrates, specifically starch, breaking it down into simpler sugars like maltose.

Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems, and flowers. The vast majority of water loss occurs through microscopic pores on the leaf surface called stomata. Water from the xylem travels to the mesophyll cells in the leaf, evaporates from their moist surfaces into the air spaces, and then diffuses out of the leaf as water vapour when the stomata are open. This loss of water vapour creates the transpirational pull that draws more water up from the roots.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. exchange of gases between the leaf and the atmosphere**\n\nThis describes the process of gas exchange, not transpiration. Gas exchange is the diffusion of gases into and out of the plant. Primarily, it involves the intake of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) for photosynthesis and the release of oxygen (O\u2082) as a waste product.

Water is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported upwards to the leaves, not from the leaves down to the roots.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis pathway incorrectly starts with the mesophyll cells. Water absorption occurs in the roots, initiated by the root hair cells, not in the mesophyll cells of the leaf. Furthermore, the sequence suggests water moves from the leaf to the root and then enters the xylem, which contradicts the established mechanism of water transport in plants.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nWhile this pathway correctly identifies the root hair cells as the starting point for water absorption, it incorrectly sequences the subsequent steps. It suggests water moves directly from the root hair cells to the mesophyll cells in the leaf, which is anatomically impossible. Water must first pass through the root cortex and then be transported a long distance up the plant via the xylem vessels before it can reach the mesophyll cells."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_338.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "18 the diagrams show the single circulation of a fish and the double circulation of a mammal.\ngill capillaries lung capillaries\ns coe)\nees z zed\nss saas\nr 0) suz y\ns$ we\nventricle y nn\natria\nies\natrium \\ el\non\nt ao z \u2014 ventricles\nzs&e 2e\nes ssg,\n3s seg\nbody capillaries body capillaries\nfish circulation mammal circulation\nwhich letters represent areas with the most oxygenated blood?\na randx b sandy c tandy d tandz", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation\n\n**B. S and Y**\n\nIn the single circulatory system of a fish, deoxygenated blood is pumped from the heart to the gill capillaries. Here, gas exchange occurs, and the blood becomes saturated with oxygen. This highly oxygenated blood then flows through vessel **S** (the dorsal aorta) to be distributed to the body capillaries.\n\nIn the double circulatory system of a mammal, the pulmonary circuit involves blood flow to and from the lungs. Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right ventricle to the lung capillaries. In the lungs, the blood is oxygenated. This oxygen-rich blood then returns to the left atrium of the heart via vessel **Y** (the pulmonary vein).\n\nTherefore, vessels **S** and **Y** both carry blood that has just been oxygenated in the respiratory organs (gills and lungs, respectively) and thus contain the most oxygenated blood in their respective systems.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. R and X**\n\nThis option is incorrect. In the fish, vessel **R** (the ventral aorta) carries deoxygenated blood from the ventricle *to* the gills to be oxygenated. In the mammal, vessel **X** (the pulmonary artery) carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle *to* the lungs to be oxygenated. Both vessels carry deoxygenated blood.\n\n**C.

One of the main types of lymphocytes, known as B-lymphocytes (or B-cells), is responsible for producing antibodies. When a B-lymphocyte encounters a specific foreign antigen (a molecule on the surface of a pathogen), it becomes activated and differentiates into a plasma cell. These plasma cells then manufacture and secrete large quantities of antibodies into the bloodstream. Antibodies are proteins that specifically bind to the antigens that triggered their production, helping to neutralise pathogens or mark them for destruction by other components of the immune system.\n\n**B. blood clotting (Incorrect)**\n\nBlood clotting, or coagulation, is the process that prevents excessive bleeding following injury. This vital function is carried out by platelets (also called thrombocytes) and a series of proteins in the blood plasma known as clotting factors. Lymphocytes are white blood cells involved in the immune response and do not have a role in the formation of a blood clot.\n\n**C. phagocytosis (Incorrect)**\n\nPhagocytosis is the process by which a cell engulfs and digests solid particles, such as pathogens or cellular debris. This is a primary function of a different type of white blood cell called a phagocyte. The main phagocytes in the blood are neutrophils and monocytes. While lymphocytes are key components of the immune system, their primary role is not phagocytosis but rather the coordination of the specific immune response and antibody production.\n\n**D. oxygen transport (Incorrect)**\n\nThe transport of oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues is the principal function of red blood cells (erythrocytes). Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, a specialised protein that binds reversibly with oxygen. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell and lack haemoglobin, so they are not involved in the transport of respiratory gases like oxygen."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_340.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "20 a patient was injected with antibodies after being bitten by a poisonous snake. the patient\nrecovered and survived.\nwhat describes the effect of the injection in the patient\u2019s body?\nactive passive memory cells\nimmunity immunity produced\n\na v x v key\n\nb jv x x v=yes\n\ncc x v v x=no\n\nd x v x", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe injection of antibodies, such as in an antivenom for a snakebite, provides passive immunity. This is because the patient is receiving pre-made antibodies from an external source, rather than their own immune system producing them. This provides immediate protection against the snake venom.\n\nActive immunity is not stimulated because the patient's lymphocytes are not activated to produce their own antibodies in response to an antigen. Consequently, since there is no primary immune response from the patient's own body, memory cells are not produced.

It claims that inspired air has less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than expired air. The reality is the opposite. Oxygen is absorbed from the air during inspiration, so expired air has less oxygen. Carbon dioxide is a waste product released into the air in the lungs, so expired air has more carbon dioxide.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis table incorrectly states that inspired air has more carbon dioxide than expired air. Carbon dioxide is a metabolic waste product that diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be removed from the body.

According to Boyle's Law, this decrease in volume leads to an increase in pressure, forcing air out of the lungs.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A is incorrect.** This option incorrectly states that all three muscle groups contract. The external and internal intercostal muscles are an antagonistic pair; they cannot both contract simultaneously. Furthermore, the contraction of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are actions associated with inhalation (breathing in), as they increase the volume of the thoracic cavity.\n\n**C is incorrect.** This option incorrectly states that the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm contract during exhalation. The contraction of these two muscle groups increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, which lowers the internal pressure to draw air *into* the lungs during inhalation. For exhalation, these muscles must relax.\n\n**D is incorrect.** While the relaxation of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm does occur during quiet, passive exhalation, this option incorrectly states that the pressure in the thorax is low. To expel air, the pressure inside the thorax must be higher than the external atmospheric pressure. A low pressure in the thorax is what causes air to be drawn into the lungs during inhalation.

It acts as an intermediary, connecting the sensory neurone to the motor neurone. This is a relay neurone, or interneurone.\n3.  **Motor Neurone (N):** Neurone N has its cell body at one end and a long axon extending to an effector. This structure is characteristic of a motor neurone, which carries impulses from the CNS to an effector (a muscle or gland) to produce a response.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence for an impulse travelling during a reflex action is from the sensory neurone (L) to the relay neurone (M), and finally to the motor neurone (N).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis sequence, M \u2192 L \u2192 N, is incorrect.

The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones, which have distinct functions. Cones are responsible for colour vision (photopic vision) and function best in bright light. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue). The brain interprets the relative stimulation of these cones to perceive a wide spectrum of colours. Rods, in contrast, are responsible for vision in low light conditions (scotopic vision). They do not detect colour; instead, they detect differences in light intensity, allowing for vision in shades of grey.\n\n### **Explanation for option B**\nThis statement is incorrect. The blind spot, also known as the optic disc, is the region of the retina where the ganglion cell axons exit the eye to form the optic nerve. This area is completely devoid of any photoreceptor cells, meaning it contains neither rods nor cones. Consequently, any light that falls on the blind spot cannot be detected, resulting in a gap in the visual field.\n\n### **Explanation for option C**\nThis statement is correct. Rods are specialised for functioning in low light levels and are extremely sensitive to light. They contain a light-sensitive pigment called rhodopsin, which can be activated by a very small amount of light (as little as a single photon). This high sensitivity enables vision in dim conditions, such as at night. Cones, however, require much brighter light to be stimulated. While they provide high-resolution and colour vision, their lower sensitivity makes them largely ineffective in low light.\n\n### **Explanation for option D**\nThis statement is incorrect. It reverses the actual number of types for each photoreceptor. In the human eye, there is only one type of rod cell, which is sensitive to a broad range of light wavelengths and detects light intensity. Conversely, there are three distinct types of cone cells. Each type of cone contains a different photopigment (photopsin) that is maximally sensitive to a specific part of the light spectrum: short-wavelength (blue), medium-wavelength (green), or long-wavelength (red) light.

They function by targeting unique cellular structures or metabolic pathways present in bacterial cells but absent in human cells, such as the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This specificity allows them to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth without harming the host.\n\nViruses, on the other hand, have a fundamentally different structure and are not living cells. They lack the cellular machinery that antibiotics target. Instead, they replicate by invading host cells and using the host's own machinery.

The male gamete is the sperm, and the female gamete is the ovum (egg cell). These gametes are produced through a type of cell division called meiosis, which reduces the number of chromosomes by half. Consequently, gametes contain only a single set of 23 chromosomes and are referred to as haploid (n). This is essential because when a haploid sperm fertilises a haploid ovum, the resulting zygote has its full complement of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), making it diploid (2n). This restores the normal chromosome number for a human, allowing the zygote to develop into a diploid offspring.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** Fertilisation is the process involving the fusion of the nuclei of two gametes. As gametes are haploid (n), fertilisation correctly describes the fusion of two *haploid* nuclei to form a diploid (2n) zygote. The fusion of two diploid (2n) nuclei would result in a tetraploid (4n) nucleus, which is not the mechanism of human reproduction.\n\n**C:** The sperm is the male gamete, a haploid cell carrying the father's genetic material. A zygote is the single diploid cell that is formed after the sperm has successfully fertilised an ovum. The zygote is the first cell of a new individual, containing the combined genetic material from both parents. Therefore, a sperm is a gamete that participates in fertilisation, not the resulting zygote.\n\n**D:** Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a single diploid zygote. This diploid zygote then undergoes numerous rounds of mitosis (cell division that maintains the chromosome number) to grow and develop into a multicellular, diploid offspring.

This hormone plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, specifically in the repair and proliferation of the uterine lining (endometrium) following menstruation. It is also responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as the growth of breasts and the widening of the hips.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Cervix:** The cervix is the lower, narrow part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Its primary functions are to allow the passage of menstrual fluid and sperm and to dilate significantly during childbirth. The cervix produces mucus, which changes in consistency during the menstrual cycle, but it is not an endocrine organ and does not produce oestrogen.\n\n**C. Oviducts:** The oviducts, also known as Fallopian tubes, are tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus. Their main function is to transport the ovum from the ovary towards the uterus. Fertilisation, the fusion of the sperm and egg, typically occurs within the oviduct. The oviducts are not endocrine glands and therefore do not produce hormones like oestrogen.\n\n**D. Uterus:** The uterus is a muscular organ where a fertilised egg implants and develops during pregnancy. The uterus is a *target organ* for oestrogen, not a site of its production. Oestrogen produced by the ovaries acts on the uterine lining (endometrium), causing it to thicken and develop a rich blood supply in preparation for potential implantation.

A key indicator of dominant inheritance in a pedigree chart is when two affected parents have an unaffected offspring. This occurs in the diagram: the two polydactyl cats in the second generation (one male, one female) mate and produce a non-polydactyl female in the third generation. For this to happen, the polydactyly allele must be dominant. If we represent the dominant allele for polydactyly as 'P' and the recessive allele for non-polydactyly as 'p', both affected parents must be heterozygous (Pp). This allows them to each pass on a recessive 'p' allele to their offspring, resulting in a homozygous recessive (pp) individual who is non-polydactyl. The trait also appears in every generation, which is characteristic of dominant inheritance.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: It is codominant.**\nCodominance occurs when both alleles in a heterozygous individual are fully and independently expressed in the phenotype, often resulting in a third, distinct phenotype. For example, in cattle, alleles for red and white coat colour can result in a roan coat with both red and white hairs. This pedigree chart only shows two phenotypes: polydactyl and non-polydactyl. There is no evidence of an intermediate or combined phenotype, so codominance can be ruled out.\n\n**B: It could be dominant or recessive.**\nThe inheritance pattern cannot be both. The evidence within the family tree conclusively rules out one of these possibilities. As shown by the mating of the two affected cats in the second generation, who produce an unaffected offspring in the third generation, the allele cannot be recessive. Therefore, it must be dominant.\n\n**D: It is recessive.**\nThis is incorrect. If the allele for polydactyly were recessive, all affected individuals would have a homozygous recessive genotype (e.g., pp). Consequently, if two affected individuals (pp x pp) were to reproduce, they could only pass on the recessive allele ('p'). This would mean that all of their offspring would have to be homozygous recessive (pp) and therefore affected.

These hairs trap a layer of still, humid air close to the leaf surface, particularly around the stomata.

A shallower gradient slows the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the leaf (transpiration), thus conserving the plant's water, which is crucial for survival in dry conditions.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: the presence of chloroplasts**\nChloroplasts are the organelles where photosynthesis occurs. Their presence is a fundamental feature of almost all plants (autotrophs), as this is how they produce their own food. This is not a specific adaptation to dry environments but a general characteristic of photosynthetic organisms.\n\n**C: the presence of phloem tissue**\nPhloem tissue is responsible for transporting sugars (produced during photosynthesis) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.

This leads to a rapid and extensive growth of producers, such as algae, in an event known as an algal bloom. When these large populations of algae die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers, specifically aerobic bacteria, then break down this large amount of dead organic matter. This decomposition process requires a significant amount of dissolved oxygen for the bacteria's respiration. The massive consumption of oxygen by these decomposers severely depletes the oxygen concentration in the water, creating hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) conditions. Fish and other aquatic animals cannot survive in these conditions as they require dissolved oxygen for their own aerobic respiration, leading to widespread death.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. increased growth of producers:** While the increased growth of producers (algal bloom) is the first major biological event in eutrophication, it is not the direct cause of fish death. This bloom sets in motion the chain of events that ultimately leads to oxygen depletion. The fish die not because of the presence of the algae, but because of the consequences following the death and decomposition of the algae.\n\n**B. increased photosynthesis by producers:** Increased photosynthesis is a result of the increased growth of producers. Photosynthesis is a process that produces oxygen. Therefore, during an algal bloom, the oxygen levels in the surface water may temporarily increase during daylight hours. However, the subsequent mass decomposition of the dead algae consumes far more oxygen than was produced, leading to a net deficit. Thus, increased photosynthesis does not cause the death of fish; the lethal condition is a lack of oxygen.\n\n**C. decreased concentration of carbon dioxide in the water:** During an algal bloom, the high rate of photosynthesis will consume large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide, causing its concentration to decrease during the day. However, a low concentration of carbon dioxide is not lethal to fish. The critical factor for the survival of fish is the availability of sufficient dissolved oxygen for respiration. Furthermore, the decomposition process that depletes oxygen also releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, so the concentration of CO\u2082 would eventually increase."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_359.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "39 which product is made using an enzyme rather than bacteria or fungi?\na insulin\nb penicillin\nc lactose-free milk\nd mycoprotein", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nLactose-free milk is produced by adding the enzyme lactase directly to regular milk.

Digestion is the process of breaking down large, insoluble food molecules into smaller, soluble molecules that can be absorbed. This process is characteristic of heterotrophic organisms, such as animals and fungi, which must consume other organisms for nutrients.

Firstly, digestion is not a characteristic of all living organisms. It is performed by heterotrophs but not by autotrophs (e.g., plants), which produce their own food. Secondly, this option incorrectly excludes respiration and excretion, which are both fundamental processes essential for all forms of life.

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through a partially permeable membrane. The potato cells act as this membrane.\n\n1.  **Water Potential Gradient:** The water inside the potato cavity has a very high water potential (as it is pure water). The concentrated sugar solution in the glass dish has a very low water potential due to the high concentration of sugar solutes. The cell sap inside the potato cells has an intermediate water potential, lower than pure water but higher than the concentrated sugar solution.\n2.  **Movement of Water:** Due to this water potential gradient, there will be a net movement of water molecules out of the region of high potential (the water in the cavity) and into the region of very low potential (the sugar solution). This movement occurs through the potato cells.\n3.  **Volume Changes:** As water leaves the cavity in the potato, its volume will decrease. As this water enters the surrounding sugar solution, the volume of the solution will increase.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the volume of water increases. Water moves down its water potential gradient. The water in the potato cavity has a higher water potential than both the potato cells and the external sugar solution. Therefore, water will move out of the cavity, not into it, causing its volume to decrease. While the volume of the sugar solution does increase, the first part of this option is incorrect.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it states that the volume of water increases, which is wrong. Water moves out of the cavity due to its high water potential, causing the volume to decrease. Secondly, it states that the volume of the sugar solution remains the same. This is also incorrect because the concentrated sugar solution has a very low water potential, causing water to move from the potato cells into it via osmosis, thus increasing its volume.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it states that the volume of water remains the same. This would only happen if there were no net movement of water, which implies no water potential gradient. A steep gradient exists, so the volume will change. Secondly, it states that the volume of the sugar solution decreases. This is the opposite of what happens.

This is described as moving a substance \"against\" or \"up\" its concentration gradient. This action allows cells to accumulate essential substances, such as mineral ions in root hair cells, or remove waste products even when the concentration inside the cell is already high.\n\n2.  **Involvement of carrier proteins (Statement 3):** This process is not random; it relies on specific protein molecules embedded within the cell membrane, known as carrier proteins or pumps. Each carrier protein is typically specific to one type of molecule or ion. The substance binds to the protein, which then changes its shape to move the substance across the membrane.\n\n3.  **Requirement for energy (Statement 4):** Moving substances against their concentration gradient is an energy-intensive process. The energy required is supplied in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is generated during cellular respiration. This is why the process is termed \"active\" transport.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect because active transport can move substances both into and out of a cell.

Active transport does not *always* transport particles into cells. It is a directional process that can also transport substances out of a cell, depending on the cell's requirements. For instance, many cells use active transport to expel waste materials or to maintain specific ion concentrations, such as pumping excess sodium ions out of the cytoplasm. The absolute term \"always\" makes this statement factually inaccurate.\n\n**C: 1 and 2 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it includes the incorrect statement 2, as active transport can also move particles out of cells. Secondly, it omits statements 3 and 4, which are fundamental to the definition of active transport. The involvement of specific carrier proteins (statement 3) and the use of energy from respiration (statement 4) are essential characteristics that distinguish active transport from passive processes like diffusion and osmosis.\n\n**D: 3 and 4 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because, while statements 3 and 4 are true and essential features of active transport, it omits statement 1. The defining purpose of using energy and carrier proteins in active transport is to move substances against their concentration gradient (from a low to a high concentration). Without including statement 1, the description of the process is incomplete.

As the temperature increases from 10\u00b0C towards the optimum temperature (around 30\u00b0C), the kinetic energy of both the enzyme and substrate molecules increases. This causes them to move faster and more randomly. Consequently, the frequency of collisions between substrate molecules and the active sites of enzymes increases. Furthermore, the collisions are more energetic, increasing the likelihood that they will be 'effective'\u2014that is, they will have sufficient energy to form an enzyme-substrate complex. This leads to a faster rate of reaction and therefore an increased rate of respiration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: The enzymes are denaturing.**\nDenaturation is the process where high temperatures cause an enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure, including its active site, to change shape permanently. This change prevents the substrate from binding, which leads to a decrease in the rate of reaction. Denaturation occurs at temperatures above the optimum, which explains the sharp fall in the rate of respiration after 30\u00b0C, not the increase before it.\n\n**C: There are fewer enzyme-substrate complexes formed.**\nThe rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction is directly dependent on the number of enzyme-substrate complexes formed per unit of time. An increase in the rate of respiration, as observed between 10\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, indicates that enzyme-substrate complexes are being formed more rapidly. The statement that fewer complexes are formed would explain a decrease in the reaction rate, not an increase.\n\n**D: There is less kinetic energy.**\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules. As the temperature rises from 10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, not decreases.

At point P, the curve has become horizontal (plateaued), which indicates that increasing the light intensity further will not increase the rate of photosynthesis. Therefore, light intensity is not the limiting factor.\n\nTo determine if carbon dioxide concentration or temperature are limiting, we can compare point P (at 20\u00b0C and 0.1% CO\u2082) with the other curves at the same light intensity.\n1.  **Carbon Dioxide:** The curve for 20\u00b0C and 0.2% CO\u2082 shows a higher rate of photosynthesis than point P. This demonstrates that if the carbon dioxide concentration were increased from 0.1% to 0.2% (while keeping temperature and light intensity constant), the rate would increase. Thus, carbon dioxide concentration is a limiting factor.\n2.  **Temperature:** The curve for 30\u00b0C and 0.1% CO\u2082 also shows a higher rate of photosynthesis than point P. This demonstrates that if the temperature were increased from 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (while keeping CO\u2082 concentration and light intensity constant), the rate would increase. Thus, temperature is also a limiting factor.\n\nTherefore, at point P, light intensity is not limiting, but both carbon dioxide concentration and temperature are.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A:** This option incorrectly identifies light intensity as a limiting factor. At point P, the graph shows a plateau, meaning the rate of photosynthesis is no longer increasing with light intensity. This signifies that light is not the factor restricting the rate. While it correctly identifies carbon dioxide concentration as a limiting factor, it incorrectly states that temperature is not.\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. It incorrectly identifies light intensity as a limiting factor, whereas the plateau on the graph indicates it is not. Furthermore, it incorrectly states that carbon dioxide concentration and temperature are not limiting factors. As shown by comparing the different curves, increasing either of these factors would increase the rate of photosynthesis, meaning they are both limiting.\n\n*   **D:** This option correctly identifies that light intensity is not a limiting factor and that temperature is a limiting factor. However, it incorrectly states that carbon dioxide concentration is not limiting. Comparing the curve for point P (0.1% CO\u2082) with the curve for 0.2% CO\u2082 at the same temperature (20\u00b0C) and light intensity reveals that a higher CO\u2082 concentration would result in a faster rate of photosynthesis.

The bacteria shown are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen for their own cellular respiration. They are therefore attracted to areas with a high concentration of oxygen.

Water is transported to the leaf through the xylem and then moves into the mesophyll cells. The spongy mesophyll layer has a large internal surface area due to the irregular shape of its cells and the presence of large air spaces between them. Water coats the surfaces of these cells, and it is from this extensive moist surface that liquid water evaporates into water vapor, filling the air spaces. This process creates a high concentration of water vapor inside the leaf, which then diffuses out into the atmosphere through the stomata.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: the cuticle**\nThe cuticle is a waxy, hydrophobic layer covering the epidermis of the leaf. Its main function is to prevent water loss by creating a waterproof barrier. While a very small amount of water can evaporate through the cuticle (known as cuticular transpiration), it is insignificant compared to the amount lost through the stomata. Therefore, the cuticle is not where most water evaporation occurs; it is a structure that minimizes it.\n\n**B: the guard cells**\nGuard cells are specialized cells that surround the stomata (pores) on the leaf surface. Their function is to regulate the opening and closing of the stomata, thereby controlling the rate of transpiration and gas exchange. They do not serve as the primary surface for evaporation. Water vapor diffuses *past* the guard cells when the stomata are open, but the change from liquid water to water vapor happens deeper within the leaf, on the surfaces of the mesophyll cells.\n\n**D: the xylem vessels**\nXylem vessels are part of the vascular tissue responsible for transporting liquid water from the roots to the leaves. They act as a transport system, delivering water to the leaf tissues. The water within the xylem is in a liquid state. Evaporation is the process of changing from a liquid to a gas, which occurs *after* the water has left the xylem vessels and moved to the surfaces of the spongy mesophyll cells.

A key waste product of aerobic respiration is carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide diffuses from the muscle cells into the bloodstream, causing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood to rise. This increase in blood carbon dioxide concentration is the primary chemical stimulus for increasing the breathing rate.\n\nSpecialised chemoreceptors, located in the medulla oblongata region of the brain, are highly sensitive to these changes. Specifically, they detect the resulting decrease in the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is caused by the increased carbon dioxide. These receptors then send signals to the respiratory control centre, also in the medulla, which in turn stimulates the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to increase the rate and depth of breathing. This enhanced ventilation helps to expel the excess carbon dioxide and restore blood pH to its normal homeostatic level.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: carbon dioxide increases, lung**\nWhile it is correct that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood increases during exercise, the primary chemoreceptors that detect this change and regulate the breathing rate are not located in the lungs. The lungs are the organs of gas exchange, but the central control system that monitors blood chemistry is located in the brain (specifically, the medulla oblongata) and major arteries (carotid and aortic bodies).\n\n**C: carbon dioxide decreases, brain**\nThis statement correctly identifies the brain as the location of the central chemoreceptors. However, it incorrectly states that carbon dioxide levels decrease. During exercise, the rate of aerobic respiration increases to meet higher energy demands. This process produces more carbon dioxide as a waste product, leading to an *increase*, not a decrease, in its concentration in the blood. A decrease in blood carbon dioxide would signal the respiratory centre to slow the breathing rate.\n\n**D: carbon dioxide decreases, lung**\nThis option is incorrect on both points. Firstly, exercise leads to an *increase* in blood carbon dioxide concentration due to a higher rate of cellular respiration.

This action also results in an increased concentration of glucose in the blood.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: adrenaline and insulin**\nThis option is incorrect because insulin has the opposite effect on blood glucose levels. While adrenaline increases blood glucose, insulin, which is secreted by the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas, lowers blood glucose concentration. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into body cells and stimulates the liver and muscles to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage.\n\n**C: adrenaline only**\nThis option is incorrect because it is incomplete. Although adrenaline does increase blood glucose concentration, it is not the only hormone with this function. Glucagon is also a key hormone that raises blood glucose levels, particularly as part of the normal homeostatic regulation between meals.\n\n**D: glucagon only**\nThis option is incorrect because it is also incomplete. While glucagon is a primary hormone for increasing blood glucose levels, especially when they are low, adrenaline also performs this function, particularly during times of stress or excitement to prepare the body for action."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_388.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "28 what is defined as a substance that is taken into the body and modifies or affects chemical\nreactions in the body?\na_ antibody\nb= drug\nc hormone\nd_ pathogen", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA drug is defined as any external chemical substance that, when taken into the body, modifies or affects chemical reactions, thereby altering physiological or psychological functions.

A significant disadvantage of this method is its dependence on the presence of a mate. If an individual organism becomes isolated from others of its species, for example, due to geographical barriers or low population density, it will be unable to reproduce. This can lead to a reduction in the overall reproductive output of the population, limiting its ability to grow or recover from a decline. This contrasts with asexual reproduction, where a single isolated individual can still produce offspring.\n\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A. a reduction in genetic diversity**\nThis statement is incorrect. Sexual reproduction is a primary driver of genetic diversity within a population. It combines the genetic material from two different parents and involves processes like crossing over and independent assortment during meiosis. This results in offspring that are genetically unique, differing from their parents and from each other. This increased variation is a major evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction.\n\n**B. a decreased ability to adapt to changes in the environment**\nThis statement is incorrect. The genetic diversity produced by sexual reproduction enhances a population's ability to adapt to environmental changes. A varied gene pool increases the likelihood that some individuals will possess traits that are advantageous in new or changing conditions. These individuals are more likely to survive and pass on their favourable alleles, allowing the population to evolve and adapt. A decreased ability to adapt is a characteristic disadvantage of asexual reproduction, which produces genetically uniform offspring.\n\n**D. an increased likelihood of a disease affecting all individuals**\nThis statement is incorrect. The genetic variation resulting from sexual reproduction provides a crucial defense against disease. In a genetically diverse population, individuals have different susceptibilities to pathogens. If a disease emerges, it is unlikely to be fatal to every individual, as some may have natural resistance. This allows the population to survive. Conversely, in an asexually reproducing population where individuals are genetically identical, a single disease to which they are all susceptible could wipe out the entire population."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_390.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "30 pollen grains from a plant were placed onto the stigma of a flower of the same plant. the lengths\nof the pollen tubes were measured for four hours.

For fertilisation to occur, the pollen tube must grow from the stigma, down the style, and into the ovule. The problem states the mean length of the style is 2 mm, which is equivalent to 2000 \u00b5m. The graph shows that the pollen tube from the same plant (self-pollination) grows to a length of much less than 500 \u00b5m in four hours. This is far too short to reach the ovule. Therefore, fertilisation cannot take place. This is a common mechanism in plants called self-incompatibility, which prevents inbreeding.\n\n*   **Statement 2: \"The difference in growth of the two types of pollen is an adaptation to increase variation.\"** This statement is correct. The graph clearly shows that pollen from a different plant (cross-pollination) is able to grow a long pollen tube rapidly, while pollen from the same plant (self-pollination) is inhibited. This mechanism promotes cross-pollination over self-pollination. Cross-pollination involves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals, which combines different sets of alleles and leads to greater genetic variation in the offspring. Increased genetic variation is crucial for the long-term survival of a species, as it allows populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

After the first trimester, it takes over the primary role of producing progesterone and oestrogen from the corpus luteum. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium), preventing it from shedding, and also inhibits uterine contractions until labour begins. Oestrogen supports the growth of the uterus and the development of the mammary glands in preparation for lactation. Both hormones work together to sustain the pregnancy and also suppress the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, preventing further ovulation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: FSH and LH**\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) are not produced by the placenta. They are gonadotropic hormones released by the anterior pituitary gland. Their primary roles are to regulate the menstrual cycle by stimulating follicular growth (FSH) and triggering ovulation (LH). During pregnancy, the high levels of progesterone and oestrogen secreted by the placenta actually inhibit the release of FSH and LH, which prevents the development of new ovarian follicles and ovulation.\n\n**B: FSH and progesterone**\nWhile the placenta does produce progesterone, it does not produce Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH). FSH is secreted by the pituitary gland and its production is suppressed during pregnancy by the high levels of placental progesterone and oestrogen. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it includes a hormone not released by the placenta.\n\n**C: oestrogen and LH**\nAlthough the placenta produces oestrogen, it does not produce Luteinizing Hormone (LH). LH is secreted by the pituitary gland and is responsible for triggering ovulation. Similar to FSH, the secretion of LH is inhibited during pregnancy by the hormones produced by the placenta.

All somatic (body) cells in an organism, including pancreatic cells, contain the same complete set of genes (the genome). However, during development, cells differentiate to perform specialized functions. This specialization is achieved by selectively \"switching on\" (expressing) or \"switching off\" (repressing) certain genes. The gene for insulin is present in nearly every cell in the body, but only the beta cells within the pancreas have the necessary regulatory factors to express this gene, leading to the synthesis and secretion of insulin protein. In all other cell types, the insulin gene remains present but is switched off.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. All of the genes in the nucleus of a cell in the pancreas are expressed.**\n\nThis is incorrect. No cell expresses all of its genes simultaneously. Doing so would be highly inefficient and would prevent the cell from becoming specialized. Each cell type only expresses the specific subset of genes required for its unique structure and function. For instance, a pancreatic cell expresses the gene for insulin but does not express the genes for muscle proteins (like actin and myosin) or for haemoglobin, as these are not part of its function. Selective gene expression is fundamental to cell differentiation and the organized functioning of a multicellular organism.\n\n**B. Other body cells do not have the gene for insulin.**\n\nThis is incorrect. With very few exceptions (such as mature red blood cells, which lack a nucleus), all somatic cells in an individual contain the exact same set of genes. This is because all body cells arise from a single fertilized egg (zygote) through mitosis, a process that creates genetically identical daughter cells. Therefore, a nerve cell, a skin cell, and a muscle cell all possess the gene for insulin. The critical difference is that in these other cell types, the gene is not expressed.\n\n**C. The cells in the pancreas have twice as many genes as the other body cells.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The number of genes is consistent across almost all somatic cells within an organism. Most human body cells are diploid, meaning they contain two complete sets of chromosomes and thus two copies of most genes. Pancreatic cells are also diploid and have the same number of genes as other somatic cells like liver cells or skin cells. A cell's specialized function is determined by which of its genes are active, not by possessing a different quantity of genes."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_393.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "33 which statement is correct?\na_ mitosis always produces offspring that are homozygous.\nb_ mitosis produces cells that are genetically identical.\nc_ mitosis produces gametes in animals.\nd_ mitosis only produces haploid cells.", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. Mitosis produces cells that are genetically identical.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth. The process begins with the replication of the cell's DNA, creating two identical copies of each chromosome (called sister chromatids). During mitosis, these sister chromatids are separated and distributed equally into two new nuclei. The result is two daughter cells that are genetically identical to each other and to the original parent cell. This process is essential for growth, repair of tissues, and asexual reproduction in some organisms.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Mitosis always produces offspring that are homozygous.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Mitosis produces cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. The terms homozygous and heterozygous describe the combination of alleles for a specific gene. A cell can be heterozygous, meaning it has two different alleles for a gene (e.g., Aa). If a heterozygous cell undergoes mitosis, the resulting daughter cells will also be heterozygous (Aa). Mitosis merely clones the parent cell's genotype; it does not change it. Therefore, mitosis does not always produce homozygous cells; it only does so if the parent cell was already homozygous.\n\n**C. Mitosis produces gametes in animals.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. In animals, gametes (sex cells, such as sperm and eggs) are produced by a different type of cell division called meiosis. Meiosis is a reduction division that halves the chromosome number, resulting in haploid cells (n). This is crucial for sexual reproduction, as the fusion of two haploid gametes during fertilisation restores the diploid chromosome number (2n) in the zygote. Mitosis, in contrast, is used to produce diploid somatic (body) cells for growth and repair.\n\n**D. Mitosis only produces haploid cells.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Mitosis is a form of cell division that conserves the chromosome number. This means the daughter cells have the same ploidy (number of sets of chromosomes) as the parent cell. In animals, most body (somatic) cells are diploid (2n). When these diploid cells divide by mitosis for growth or repair, they produce two new diploid (2n) cells. While mitosis can occur in haploid cells (for example, in the life cycles of fungi and some plants), it most commonly produces diploid cells in animals.

It arises from several processes associated with sexual reproduction. All three listed processes\u2014meiosis, random mating, and random fertilisation\u2014are sources of genetic variation.\n\n1.  **Meiosis:** This is a specialised type of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and egg cells). It is a primary source of genetic variation through two key mechanisms:\n    *   **Crossing Over:** During Prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments of their genetic material. This process creates new combinations of alleles on the chromosomes, resulting in chromosomes that are a mosaic of parental DNA.\n    *   **Independent Assortment:** During Metaphase I, pairs of homologous chromosomes align randomly at the cell's equator before being separated into different daughter cells. The orientation of each pair is independent of the others, leading to a vast number of possible combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes.\n\n2.  **Random Mating:** In a population, if mating occurs randomly, it means that an individual\u2019s choice of a mate is not influenced by their genotype or phenotype. This process shuffles the alleles in the gene pool, bringing together different combinations of genes from various parental lineages in the offspring. This contributes to the diversity of genotypes in the next generation.\n\n3.  **Random Fertilisation:** Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of a male gamete with a female gamete. Since meiosis produces millions of genetically unique sperm and typically one genetically unique egg (per cycle in humans), the specific sperm that fertilises the egg is a matter of chance. This random fusion creates a zygote with a unique diploid combination of genes, further increasing the genetic variation among offspring.\n\nTherefore, the combination of meiosis, random mating, and random fertilisation continuously shuffles existing alleles into new combinations, producing genetically unique individuals and maintaining variation within a population.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: 1 and 2 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes random fertilisation. Random fertilisation is a critical source of genetic variation. Even if meiosis produces genetically diverse gametes and mating is random, it is the chance fusion of a specific sperm with a specific egg that creates the final unique combination of alleles in the zygote. The sheer number of possible gamete combinations makes this a significant contributor to the genetic uniqueness of each individual.\n\n**C: 1 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect as it omits random mating. Random mating is the process by which gametes from different individuals in a population are brought together. It ensures that the genetic variation created by meiosis is shuffled and distributed throughout the population from one generation to the next. Without the random combination of parental genes through mating, the potential for new genotypes would be limited.\n\n**D: 2 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it omits meiosis. Meiosis is the fundamental process that generates genetic variation in the gametes themselves. Without crossing over and independent assortment during meiosis, the gametes produced by an individual would be genetically identical. Random mating and random fertilisation would then only be shuffling identical sets of parental genes, severely limiting the extent of genetic variation in the offspring."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_395.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "35 which row shows features of xerophytes that reduce water loss?\ngreen colour leaves resdiies of\nfrom reduced to p thick cuticle\n; stomata\nchlorophyll spines\na v x v x\nb v v x x\ncc x jv x v\nd x x v v\nkey\n/\u00a5 = reduces water loss\nx = does not reduce water loss", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThis option accurately identifies which features contribute to the reduction of water loss in xerophytes.\n*   **Green colour from chlorophyll (x):** Chlorophyll is a pigment essential for photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy. Its presence and colour have no direct function in preventing water loss. Therefore, it is correctly marked as not reducing water loss.\n*   **Leaves reduced to spines (\u2713):** Transpiration, the loss of water vapour from a plant, occurs primarily through the leaf surface. By having leaves reduced to spines, a xerophyte dramatically decreases its total surface area, which in turn significantly reduces the rate of transpiration. This is a crucial water-conserving adaptation.\n*   **Presence of stomata (x):** Stomata are pores, typically on the leaf surface, that are the main sites for transpiration. While they are essential for gas exchange, their presence facilitates water loss. Xerophytes have adaptations such as sunken stomata, a reduced number of stomata, or CAM photosynthesis (which allows stomata to open at night), but the presence of stomata itself is the pathway for water loss, not a mechanism to reduce it.\n*   **Thick cuticle (\u2713):** The cuticle is a waxy, waterproof layer covering the epidermis of the plant. A thick cuticle acts as an effective barrier, preventing uncontrolled water loss by evaporation directly from the epidermal cells (cuticular transpiration). This is a key structural adaptation for xerophytes.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option is incorrect because it inaccurately identifies the roles of several features. It incorrectly suggests that green colour from chlorophyll and the presence of stomata reduce water loss. Chlorophyll is for photosynthesis, and stomata are the primary sites from which water is lost.

It wrongly states that the green colour from chlorophyll reduces water loss. It also incorrectly states that a thick cuticle does not reduce water loss, failing to recognise this key adaptation for preventing water evaporation from the plant's surface.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it contains two significant errors. It incorrectly claims that the presence of stomata reduces water loss, whereas stomata are the main pathway for water to escape the plant.

The producers, which are at the base of the pyramid, convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. In this food chain, the tree is the producer. As energy is transferred to the next trophic level (from the tree to the insect), a significant portion (approximately 90%) is lost, primarily as heat during metabolic processes, and some is not consumed. This pattern of energy loss continues at each successive trophic level. Consequently, the amount of available energy decreases significantly as one moves up the food chain.

Drawn as a pyramid of biomass, the hawk would have the largest bar size.**\nA pyramid of biomass represents the total dry mass of organisms at each trophic level. In most terrestrial ecosystems, the total biomass decreases at each successive trophic level. The producer (the tree) has the largest biomass, which supports a smaller biomass of primary consumers (insects), and so on. The hawk, being the tertiary consumer at the top of the food chain, would have the smallest total biomass. Therefore, the hawk would have the smallest bar, not the largest.\n\n**C. Drawn as a pyramid of energy, the tree would have the smallest bar size.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Due to the second law of thermodynamics, energy is lost at each transfer between trophic levels. To support the entire food chain, the producer level must have the largest store of energy. Therefore, the tree (the producer) would have the largest bar in a pyramid of energy, representing the maximum energy content, not the smallest. Pyramids of energy are always upright.\n\n**D.

This results in an inverted or spindle-shaped pyramid of numbers, where the base (producers) is very small. The hawk, as the top predator, would exist in very small numbers compared to the organisms at lower levels like insects.

By converting fixed nitrogen compounds back into inert nitrogen gas, denitrification releases N\u2082 into the atmosphere, thereby completing the nitrogen cycle.\n\n**A. decomposition (Incorrect)**\nDecomposition, also known as ammonification in the nitrogen cycle, is the breakdown of organic matter (such as dead plants, animals, and their waste products) by bacteria and fungi.

Therefore, his genotype is **X^BY**.\n\n2.  **Determine the possible offspring genotypes:**\n    *   The mother (X^bX^b) can only pass on an **X^b** allele to her children.\n    *   The father (X^BY) can pass on either an **X^B** allele (to his daughters) or a **Y** chromosome (to his sons).\n\n3.  **Analyze the predicted outcomes for the children:**\n    *   **Sons:** All sons inherit the Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother. In this case, they will all inherit the X^b allele from their mother. Their genotype will be **X^bY**. Since the allele for colour blindness (X^b) is present on their only X chromosome, all boys will be colour-blind.\n    *   **Daughters:** All daughters inherit one X chromosome from their father (X^B) and one from their mother (X^b). Their genotype will be **X^BX^b**. Because they have the dominant allele for normal vision (X^B), it will mask the effect of the recessive allele (X^b). Therefore, all girls will have normal vision, although they will be carriers of the colour blindness allele.\n\nThis genetic cross predicts that 100% of the boys will be colour-blind, and 100% of the girls will have normal vision.\n\n---\n### **Explanations for Incorrect Answers**\n\n**A. Boys will be colour-blind, and girls will have a 50% chance of being colour-blind.**\n\nThis is incorrect because all daughters will inherit the X chromosome carrying the dominant allele for normal vision (X^B) from their father. This dominant allele ensures they will all have normal vision. There is a 0% chance, not a 50% chance, that a daughter will be colour-blind in this specific cross.\n\n**C. Girls will be colour-blind, and boys will have a 50% chance of being colour-blind.**\n\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, all girls will have normal vision because they inherit a dominant allele (X^B) from their father. Secondly, all boys must inherit an X chromosome from their colour-blind mother (X^bX^b), meaning they all receive the recessive allele. Therefore, there is a 100% chance, not a 50% chance, that a son will be colour-blind.\n\n**D. Girls will be colour-blind, and boys will have normal vision.**\n\nThis statement reverses the actual outcome. Girls inherit the father's X chromosome with the normal vision allele (X^B), so they will not be colour-blind. Boys inherit the mother's X chromosome with the colour-blind allele (X^b) and have no second X chromosome to carry a dominant allele, so they will be colour-blind, not have normal vision."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_399.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "39 one method of conserving fish stocks is to have a minimum mesh size for fishing nets.\nhow is the mesh size chosen to conserve a particular fish species?\na_ the holes in the net must be small enough to catch only young fish.\nb_ the holes in the net must be small enough to catch all fish old enough to reproduce.\nc_ the holes in the net must be large enough to catch some fish of all ages.\nd_ the holes in the net must be large enough to allow young fish to escape.", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe holes in the net must be large enough to allow young fish to escape. This is a fundamental principle of sustainable fisheries management. For a fish population, or \"stock,\" to remain stable, a sufficient number of individuals must survive to reach sexual maturity and reproduce. By setting a minimum mesh size, fisheries regulations ensure that juvenile fish, which are smaller than mature adults, can swim through the holes in the net. This allows them to escape capture, grow to reproductive age, and contribute to the next generation, thereby replenishing the population. The larger, mature fish are retained by the net, allowing for a harvest without depleting the future stock.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The holes in the net must be small enough to catch only young fish.**\nThis strategy would be directly counterproductive to conservation. Catching young, immature fish removes them from the population before they have had a chance to reproduce. This practice, known as recruitment overfishing, would lead to a rapid decline and potential collapse of the fish stock, as there would be no new generations to replace the harvested fish.\n\n**B: The holes in the net must be small enough to catch all fish old enough to reproduce.**\nWhile this seems to protect the very youngest fish, it is an unsustainable practice. Conservation aims to maintain a healthy breeding population, not eliminate it. Catching all individuals that have reached reproductive age would prevent any further spawning from that cohort, severely limiting the population's ability to sustain itself. Sustainable harvesting requires that a significant portion of the breeding stock is left in the water to continue reproducing.\n\n**C: The holes in the net must be large enough to catch some fish of all ages.**\nThis statement is contradictory. To catch fish of all ages, including the smallest juveniles, the mesh size would need to be extremely small. Conversely, a large mesh size is specifically designed to be selective, allowing smaller fish to escape. Catching fish of all ages indiscriminately is not a conservation method; it fails to protect the young fish that are crucial for the future of the population."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_400.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "40 the diagram shows how a human gene can be inserted into a bacterium.\nhuman cell \u2018\noe\n1 \u00a9 /o\n2.\ngene removed from a =a a bacterial plasmid\nhuman chromosome is removed and cut\n3\na human gene is inserted\ninto the plasmid\nwhich row shows the correct processes at 1, 2, 3 and 4?\nusing \u2014 fii\nao using ligase multiplication\nrestriction e\nenzymes of bacteria\nenzymes\na 1 2 3\nb 1 and 2 3 4\ncc 1 and 3 2 4\nd 4 1 and 2 3\npermission to reproduce items where third-party owned material protected by copyright is included has been sought and cleared where possible. every\nreasonable effort has been made by the publisher (ucles) to trace copyright holders, but if any items requiring clearance have unwittingly been included, the\npublisher will be pleased to make amends at the earliest possible opportunity.\nto avoid the issue of disclosure of answer-related information to candidates, all copyright acknowledgements are reproduced online in the cambridge\nassessment international education copyright acknowledgements booklet. this is produced for each series of examinations and is freely available to download\nat www.cambridgeinternational.org after the live examination series.\ncambridge assessment international education is part of cambridge assessment. cambridge assessment is the brand name of the university of cambridge\nlocal examinations syndicate (ucles), which is a department of the university of cambridge.", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies the key processes in genetic engineering.\n*   **Using restriction enzymes (Processes 1 and 2):** Restriction enzymes are molecular scissors that cut DNA at specific recognition sites.

Breathing is the mechanical process of taking air into and out of the body (ventilation), which is specific to certain animals with lungs or gills. All organisms perform gas exchange, but the mechanism varies. For example, plants exchange gases through pores called stomata, and single-celled organisms do so across their cell surface. The universal process is cellular respiration, not the physical act of breathing.\n\n**B. egestion, nutrition and reproduction**\nWhile nutrition and reproduction are characteristics of living organisms, **egestion** is not. Egestion is the process of discharging undigested or waste material (faeces) from a cell or body. This process only occurs in organisms that ingest complex food that cannot be fully broken down (heterotrophs, like animals). Organisms that produce their own food, such as plants (autotrophs), do not perform egestion.\n\n**C. digestion, excretion and respiration**\nWhile excretion and respiration are characteristics of living organisms, **digestion** is not.

This creates a water potential gradient. Pure water has the highest water potential (0 kPa), while the cell sap has a lower (more negative) water potential due to dissolved solutes.\n\nAccording to the principle of osmosis, water moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential across a partially permeable membrane. Consequently, water enters the plant cell's vacuole and cytoplasm. As water fills the vacuole, the vacuole swells and pushes the cytoplasm and cell membrane against the inelastic cell wall. The cell becomes swollen and firm, a state known as being **turgid**. The rigid cell wall prevents the cell from bursting. Diagram D correctly illustrates this turgid state, showing the cell membrane pressed firmly against the cell wall and a large, swollen vacuole.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A**\nThis diagram depicts an animal cell, not a plant cell. This is evident from the irregular shape and the absence of a rigid, outer cell wall. The question specifically asks for the appearance of a plant cell.\n\n**B**\nThis diagram shows a cell that has burst, a process called cytolysis. This occurs when an animal cell is placed in pure water. Without a cell wall to withstand the internal pressure (turgor pressure) from the influx of water, the cell membrane ruptures. Plant cells do not burst in pure water because their strong cellulose cell wall provides structural support and prevents over-expansion.\n\n**C**\nThis diagram shows a plasmolysed plant cell. Plasmolysis is the process where the cell membrane and cytoplasm pull away from the cell wall due to water loss. This occurs when a plant cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential than the cell (a hypertonic solution, such as concentrated salt water), causing water to move out of the cell by osmosis.

This process requires energy, which is supplied by cellular respiration. Ion uptake by root hair cells is a classic example of active transport. The concentration of mineral ions (such as nitrates) is often higher inside the cytoplasm of root hair cells than in the soil water. Therefore, to absorb these essential ions from the soil, the plant must actively transport them into the root cells, a process that requires energy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. oxygen movement from the alveoli to the blood**\nThis process occurs by diffusion. The concentration of oxygen is higher in the air within the alveoli than in the deoxygenated blood in the surrounding capillaries. Consequently, oxygen moves passively down its concentration gradient from the alveoli into the blood. Diffusion does not require metabolic energy.\n\n**C. water movement through a plant by transpiration pull**\nThe movement of water up the xylem from the roots to the leaves is a physical process known as the transpiration stream or transpiration pull. It is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaf surfaces, which creates a tension or suction that pulls the column of water upwards. The movement of water molecules themselves across cell membranes (e.g., into root hairs) occurs by osmosis. Both the transpiration pull and osmosis are passive processes that do not require metabolic energy from the plant.\n\n**D. absorption of water into a lacteal in a small intestine villus**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the lacteal, a lymphatic capillary in the villus, is primarily responsible for the absorption of digested fats (fatty acids and glycerol), not water. Water is mainly absorbed into the blood capillaries of the villus. Secondly, and more importantly, the movement of water across any biological membrane is always a passive process called osmosis.

Denaturation is the reason for the sharp decline in the reaction rate *after* the optimum temperature has been exceeded, not for the initial increase in rate shown in section X.\n\n**C: The number of active sites is increasing.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The concentration of the enzyme in the reaction mixture is constant.

Leaves are the primary site of photosynthesis and thus the main source of sugars. The potato tubers are actively storing starch during growth, making them a sink, not a source. A tuber would only act as a source when it sprouts after a period of dormancy, using its stored food to fuel new growth.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly identifies the flowers and potato tubers as sources and the leaves as a sink. Flowers and developing tubers are areas of high metabolic activity and storage that consume energy, making them sinks. Leaves are the primary producers of energy through photosynthesis, making them the source.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly identifies the flowers as a source.

The intensity of light follows the inverse square law, which states that light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (Intensity \u221d 1/distance\u00b2).\n\nIn this experiment, test-tube Q is placed at 10 cm from the light source, which is half the distance of test-tube P (20 cm). According to the inverse square law, halving the distance increases the light intensity by a factor of 2\u00b2, which is 4.\n\nAssuming that light intensity is the limiting factor, the rate of photosynthesis (measured by the number of bubbles produced) will be directly proportional to the light intensity. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis in test-tube Q should be approximately four times the rate in test-tube P.\n\nCalculation:\nRate in P = 12 bubbles per minute.\nExpected rate in Q = Rate in P \u00d7 4 = 12 \u00d7 4 = 48 bubbles per minute.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 0**\nThis option is incorrect. A rate of 0 bubbles per minute would mean that photosynthesis has stopped completely. Test-tube Q is closer to the light source than test-tube P, meaning it receives a higher intensity of light. Increased light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis (assuming light is the limiting factor), it does not stop it.\n\n**B: 3**\nThis option is incorrect. A rate of 3 bubbles per minute would represent a fourfold decrease in the rate of photosynthesis compared to test-tube P. A decrease in the rate would occur if the light source were moved further away, not closer. For example, moving the light source to 40 cm (doubling the distance) would decrease the light intensity by a factor of four, likely resulting in a rate of approximately 3 bubbles per minute (12 \u00f7 4).\n\n**C: 12**\nThis option is incorrect. A rate of 12 bubbles per minute would suggest that the rate of photosynthesis is the same in both test tubes, despite the difference in light intensity. This would only be possible if light was not the limiting factor and another factor, such as carbon dioxide concentration or temperature, was limiting the rate to a maximum of 12 bubbles per minute. However, the experiment is designed to show the effect of light intensity, so it is most likely that the rate will change in proportion to the intensity.

The wall of the stomach is lined with gastric glands that secrete gastric juice. This juice contains hydrochloric acid, which is produced by specialized parietal cells. Hydrochloric acid has two main functions in digestion: it kills most pathogens (like bacteria) that are ingested with food, and it creates a very low pH environment (typically between 1.5 and 3.5). This acidic condition is optimal for the function of pepsin, a protease enzyme that begins the chemical digestion of proteins.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **B:** This organ is the pancreas. The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes like amylase, lipase, and trypsin. However, pancreatic juice is alkaline, not acidic. It contains bicarbonate ions that neutralize the acidic chyme entering the small intestine from the stomach. This neutralization is essential to create the optimal pH for enzymes in the small intestine to function.\n\n*   **C:** This organ is the large intestine. The primary role of the large intestine is to absorb water and electrolytes from undigested food material and to form and store faeces.

The small intestine is the main site for the final digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients.

After digestion, small, soluble nutrient molecules, such as glucose and amino acids, are absorbed from the lumen of the small intestine across the single layer of epithelial cells that form the villus wall. These nutrients then diffuse into the blood within this dense network of capillaries. The capillaries have very thin walls (only one cell thick), which provides a short diffusion path, and a large surface area, which maximises the rate of absorption into the bloodstream.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The structure labelled A is the lacteal. The lacteal is a lymphatic capillary, not a blood capillary. Its primary function is to absorb the products of fat digestion, specifically fatty acids and glycerol. These molecules are transported via the lymphatic system before eventually entering the bloodstream, but the initial absorption site for fats is the lacteal, not the blood capillaries directly.\n\n**C:** The vessel labelled C is a venule (a small vein). It is formed by the joining of the capillaries (B) and carries nutrient-rich blood *away* from the villus.

Inside the leaf, water evaporates from the surfaces of the moist mesophyll cells into the air spaces. This increases the concentration of water vapour molecules within these air spaces. Typically, the air outside the leaf has a lower concentration of water vapour. This difference in concentration creates a concentration gradient. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Therefore, water vapour diffuses down its concentration gradient from the air spaces inside the leaf, out through the stomata, and into the surrounding atmosphere. This is a passive process and does not require the plant to expend energy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: active transport**\nActive transport is the movement of molecules or ions across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, i.e., against a concentration gradient. This process requires energy in the form of ATP. The loss of water vapour from a leaf occurs down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration) and is a passive process that does not require energy. Therefore, it is not active transport.\n\n**C: osmosis**\nOsmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. While osmosis is responsible for the movement of liquid water between plant cells (e.g., from the xylem to the mesophyll cells), the final stage of water loss from the leaf involves water in its gaseous state (water vapour). This water vapour moves from the air spaces within the leaf to the outside air through pores (stomata), not across a partially permeable membrane. Therefore, the process is diffusion, not osmosis.\n\n**D: photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is a chemical process in which light energy is used to synthesise glucose from carbon dioxide and water. While water is a necessary reactant for photosynthesis, this process describes the chemical conversion and consumption of water within the chloroplasts of leaf cells. It does not describe the physical process by which water vapour is lost from the leaf surface to the atmosphere."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_417.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "17 the pathway taken by water through a plant is shown.\nroot hair cells \u2014 root cortex cells + z \u2014 mesophyll cells\nwhich part of the pathway is z?\na palisade cells\nb_ phloem\nc_ stomata\nd= xylem", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. xylem**\n\nThe pathway shown illustrates the movement of water from the soil into the roots, up the plant, and into the leaves. Water is first absorbed from the soil by root hair cells through osmosis. It then moves across the root cortex cells to the center of the root. From the root, water must be transported over a long distance, up the stem, to the leaves. This long-distance transport is the primary function of the xylem tissue. Xylem vessels form a continuous, hollow tube from the roots to the leaves, allowing for the bulk flow of water in a process called the transpiration stream. Once in the leaves, the xylem delivers water to the mesophyll cells for use in photosynthesis and to maintain turgor. Therefore, the xylem is the component that connects the root cortex cells to the mesophyll cells in the water transport pathway.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. palisade cells**\nPalisade cells are a type of mesophyll cell located in the upper layer of the leaf. Their primary function is photosynthesis, as they contain numerous chloroplasts. They are a destination for the water transported through the plant, not a part of the transport system itself. Water moves from the xylem into the palisade cells, placing them at the end of the pathway shown, after Z.\n\n**B. phloem**\nPhloem is a vascular tissue, like xylem, but it has a different function. Phloem transports sugars, primarily sucrose, produced during photosynthesis from the leaves (the source) to other parts of the plant where they are needed for energy or storage, such as the roots or fruits (the sinks). This process is called translocation. Phloem is not responsible for transporting water from the roots to the leaves.\n\n**C. stomata**\nStomata are small pores, usually on the underside of leaves, that are responsible for gas exchange (allowing carbon dioxide to enter for photosynthesis and oxygen to exit) and transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water vapor diffuses out of the leaf. Stomata represent the final exit point for most of the water that travels through the plant, not the vessel that transports water to the leaf cells."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_418.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "18 the graph shows the thickness of the muscular wall in each of the four chambers of the\nmammalian heart.\nwhich chamber is the right ventricle?\nthickness of\nmuscular wall\na b c d\nheart chamber", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe thickness of the muscular wall of a heart chamber is directly related to the pressure it must generate to pump blood. The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. This pulmonary circulation is a relatively low-pressure system as the lungs are located close to the heart. In contrast, the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, which requires significantly higher pressure, and thus a much thicker muscular wall. The atria (both right and left) only pump blood into the adjacent ventricles, a very short distance, so they have the thinnest walls. Therefore, the right ventricle has the second thickest muscular wall, after the left ventricle and before the atria. Chamber B in the graph represents the chamber with the second thickest wall, which corresponds to the right ventricle.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nChamber A is shown to have the thickest muscular wall of the four chambers. This structure corresponds to the left ventricle. The left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the aorta and throughout the entire systemic circulation, which supplies the whole body. To overcome the high resistance of this extensive network of blood vessels and pump blood over a long distance, the left ventricle must generate the highest pressure of any chamber. Consequently, it has the most developed and thickest muscular wall.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nChamber C is shown to have a very thin muscular wall, comparable to chamber D. This structure is characteristic of an atrium, not a ventricle. The atria (right and left) function to receive blood returning to the heart (deoxygenated from the body into the right atrium, and oxygenated from the lungs into the left atrium) and pump it a short distance into the ventricles below. This requires very little pressure, so their muscular walls are thin. The right ventricle, which must pump blood to the lungs, requires a much thicker wall than an atrium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nChamber D is shown to have one of the thinnest muscular walls, similar in thickness to chamber C. This thin wall is characteristic of an atrium. The primary role of the atria is to receive blood and pass it to the ventricles. This action does not require significant force. The right ventricle, however, has the crucial function of pumping blood through the entire pulmonary circuit to the lungs. This requires a substantial muscular wall, much thicker than that of an atrium, to generate the necessary pressure.

The prefix \"an-\" means \"without,\" and \"aerobic\" relates to oxygen. Therefore, the first part of the statement, \"does not require oxygen,\" is correct.\n\nDuring anaerobic respiration, the breakdown of glucose is incomplete. In animals, glucose is converted into lactic acid. In yeast and some plants, it is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Because the glucose molecule is not fully broken down (as it is in aerobic respiration to carbon dioxide and water), only a small fraction of its chemical energy is released and converted into ATP. Aerobic respiration is far more efficient, yielding significantly more ATP per glucose molecule. Thus, the second part of the statement, \"releases less energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration,\" is also correct.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Anaerobic respiration requires oxygen and releases less energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.**\nThis statement is incorrect because its initial premise is false. Anaerobic respiration, by definition, occurs in the absence of oxygen. The process that requires oxygen to break down glucose is called aerobic respiration. Although the second part of the statement is correct (anaerobic respiration does release less energy), the first part makes the entire statement incorrect.\n\n**B) Anaerobic respiration requires oxygen and releases more energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two fundamental points. Firstly, anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen. Secondly, because it involves the incomplete breakdown of glucose, it releases significantly less energy, not more, than aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration completely oxidizes glucose, maximizing the energy yield.\n\n**D) Anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen and releases more energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.**\nWhile this statement correctly identifies that anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen, it is incorrect in its comparison of energy release. Aerobic respiration is a much more efficient process, resulting in the complete breakdown of glucose and the release of a large amount of energy. Anaerobic respiration, being an incomplete breakdown, yields only a very small amount of energy in comparison. Therefore, it releases less energy, not more, than aerobic respiration."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_424.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "24 during exercise an oxygen debt may occur in muscles.\nwhat is the cause of this oxygen debt?\na_ aerobic respiration causes a decrease in lactic acid.\nb_ aerobic respiration causes an increase in lactic acid.\nc_ anaerobic respiration causes a decrease in lactic acid.\nd_ anaerobic respiration causes an increase in lactic acid.", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nDuring strenuous exercise, the energy demand of muscle cells can exceed the rate at which the cardiovascular system can supply oxygen. To continue providing energy (ATP) for contraction, muscle cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration in animals involves the partial breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen, producing lactic acid as a byproduct. This accumulation of lactic acid leads to muscle fatigue and creates an 'oxygen debt'. The oxygen debt is the volume of extra oxygen required after exercise to break down the accumulated lactic acid and restore normal metabolic conditions. Therefore, the increase in lactic acid caused by anaerobic respiration is the direct cause of the oxygen debt.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** Aerobic respiration is the complete breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen, producing carbon dioxide and water. It does not directly cause a decrease in lactic acid. While the extra oxygen consumed after exercise (to repay the oxygen debt) is used to oxidise lactic acid, the process of aerobic respiration itself does not cause the debt; rather, it is the primary mode of energy production when oxygen is plentiful.\n\n**B:** Aerobic respiration does not produce lactic acid. Lactic acid is a product of anaerobic respiration, which occurs specifically when oxygen is not available in sufficient quantities. The products of aerobic respiration are carbon dioxide, water, and a large amount of ATP.\n\n**C:** Anaerobic respiration is the process that *produces* lactic acid from the incomplete breakdown of glucose. Therefore, it causes an *increase* in the concentration of lactic acid in the muscles, not a decrease.

This response is mediated by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is produced in the tip of the shoot and diffuses downwards. Light causes auxin to move from the illuminated side to the shaded side of the shoot. This leads to an **unequal distribution** of the hormone, with a higher concentration accumulating on the shaded side. In shoots, auxin **stimulates cell elongation**. Consequently, the cells on the shaded side, with more auxin, elongate more rapidly than the cells on the lit side. This differential growth causes the shoot to bend towards the light source.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Auxin is equally distributed in response to light and stimulates cell elongation.**\nThis statement is incorrect because unilateral light causes an unequal distribution of auxin. Auxin migrates to the shaded side of the shoot, resulting in a higher concentration there. While auxin does stimulate cell elongation in shoots, the distribution is not equal under these conditions. Equal distribution would only occur if the light source were directly overhead or absent, leading to straight vertical growth.\n\n**B) Auxin is equally distributed in response to light and inhibits cell elongation.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, unilateral light causes an unequal distribution of auxin. Secondly, in plant shoots, auxin stimulates cell elongation, it does not inhibit it. Inhibition of cell elongation by high concentrations of auxin occurs in roots, not shoots.\n\n**D) Auxin is unequally distributed in response to light and inhibits cell elongation.**\nThis statement is partially correct in that auxin is unequally distributed in response to unilateral light.

The fusion of the haploid nuclei of these two gametes is the process of fertilisation (Statement 4). This fusion results in the formation of a single cell called a zygote.

Progesterone is primarily secreted by the corpus luteum, which forms in the ovary from the ruptured follicle after ovulation (around day 14).

Following ovulation, the corpus luteum begins to produce progesterone, causing its concentration to rise significantly throughout the second half of the cycle (the luteal phase). The main function of this high level of progesterone is to maintain the thickened uterine lining (endometrium), preparing it for potential implantation of a fertilised egg.

In that cross, 50% of the offspring would have the Yy genotype (yellow phenotype) and 50% would have the yy genotype (green phenotype).

It contains four chromosomes, and each chromosome is composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere.\n2.  **Process of Mitosis:** During the anaphase stage of mitosis, the sister chromatids of each chromosome are pulled apart and move to opposite poles of the cell. Each separated chromatid is now considered an individual, unreplicated chromosome.\n3.  **Final Product:** The cell then divides (cytokinesis) into two. Each new daughter cell receives a complete set of these unreplicated chromosomes. Therefore, each daughter cell will be genetically identical to the other and to the original parent cell (before replication).

This is incorrect because the fundamental event of mitosis is the separation of sister chromatids. The resulting daughter cells should contain unreplicated chromosomes, not replicated ones.\n\n**B:** This option shows two cells where the chromosome number has been halved (from four to two), and the chromosomes are still in their *replicated* state. This is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, mitosis maintains the chromosome number of the parent cell; it does not halve it. Secondly, the chromosomes in the daughter cells should be unreplicated. This diagram is more representative of the outcome of the first meiotic division (Meiosis I).\n\n**D:** This option shows two cells that contain unreplicated chromosomes, but the chromosome number has been halved (from four to two). This is incorrect because mitosis conserves the chromosome number. A reduction in chromosome number (ploidy level) is characteristic of meiosis, not mitosis.

For a hydrophyte with floating leaves, such as a water lily, the lower epidermis of the leaf is in direct contact with water, while the upper epidermis is exposed to the air. Stomata are pores that facilitate gas exchange (uptake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen and water vapour) with the atmosphere. For gas exchange to occur, stomata must be in contact with the air. Therefore, in a floating hydrophyte, stomata are located exclusively on the upper epidermis. The lower epidermis, being submerged, has no stomata. Plant C shows a high density of stomata on the upper epidermis (460 per mm\u00b2) and zero on the lower epidermis, which is the characteristic adaptation for a floating hydrophytic plant.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nPlant A has stomata on both the upper (25 per mm\u00b2) and lower (16 per mm\u00b2) epidermis. The presence of stomata on the lower surface indicates that this surface is exposed to the air, not submerged in water. Therefore, Plant A is likely a terrestrial plant, not a floating hydrophyte. The relatively low density of stomata on both surfaces might suggest an adaptation to a specific terrestrial environment, but it does not match the profile of a hydrophyte.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nPlant B has a significant number of stomata on both the upper (70 per mm\u00b2) and lower (88 per mm\u00b2) epidermis. This distribution, with stomata present on both surfaces but typically more numerous on the cooler, more sheltered lower side, is characteristic of a mesophyte\u2014a terrestrial plant living in an environment with a moderate water supply. A floating hydrophyte would not have stomata on its water-bound lower surface.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nPlant D has no stomata on the upper epidermis and a high density on the lower epidermis (150 per mm\u00b2). This is a common adaptation for many terrestrial plants, including mesophytes and xerophytes (plants adapted to dry conditions). Placing stomata on the lower surface reduces water loss through transpiration, as this side is sheltered from direct sunlight and wind.

This conversion is primarily carried out by specialised microorganisms, including free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil (e.g., *Azotobacter*) and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., *Rhizobium*) that live in the root nodules of leguminous plants. Atmospheric nitrogen is unusable by most living organisms due to the strong triple bond holding the two nitrogen atoms together. Nitrogen fixation 'fixes' this atmospheric nitrogen into a biologically available form, making it accessible for plants to absorb and incorporate into essential organic molecules like proteins and nucleic acids.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. decomposition:**\nDecomposition is the process where decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, break down dead organic matter (e.g., dead plants and animals, faeces, urine). This process releases the nitrogen that was locked within the organic molecules of these organisms back into the soil, typically in the form of ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a). Decomposition recycles nitrogen already present in the ecosystem's biomass; it does not take nitrogen from the air.\n\n**B. denitrification:**\nDenitrification is the process that returns nitrogen gas to the atmosphere, effectively completing the nitrogen cycle. It is carried out by denitrifying bacteria in the soil, which convert nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b) back into gaseous nitrogen (N\u2082). This process occurs under anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions and reduces the amount of usable nitrogen in the soil. It is the opposite of the process described in the question.\n\n**C. nitrification:**\nNitrification is a two-step process performed by nitrifying bacteria in the soil. In the first step, ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a) are oxidised into nitrites (NO\u2082\u207b). In the second step, nitrites are further oxidised into nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b).

These nitrates act as a fertilizer, causing a rapid and excessive growth of aquatic producers, primarily algae. This phenomenon is known as an algal bloom.\n\n2.  **(Stage 2) Increased decomposition after death of producers:** The algal bloom creates a dense layer on the water's surface, blocking sunlight from reaching plants and algae below, causing them to die. Additionally, the short lifespan of the algae in the bloom leads to a large amount of dead organic matter sinking to the bottom. This abundance of dead material leads to a significant increase in the population of decomposers (bacteria and fungi) and the rate of decomposition.\n\n3.  **(Stage 1) Increased aerobic respiration by decomposers:** The decomposers are aerobic organisms, meaning they require oxygen to respire as they break down the dead organic matter. The massive increase in the decomposer population results in a correspondingly high rate of aerobic respiration throughout the water.\n\n4.  **(Stage 4) Reduction in dissolved oxygen:** The high rate of aerobic respiration by the decomposers consumes large quantities of dissolved oxygen from the water, leading to a severe depletion of oxygen levels (hypoxia or anoxia). Fish and other aquatic animals cannot obtain enough oxygen to survive in these conditions and die from suffocation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2**\nThis sequence is incorrect because it reverses the cause-and-effect relationship.

The growth of producers (3) must occur first to provide the organic matter for decomposition (2).\n\n**B: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 3**\nThis sequence is logically flawed. It starts with increased aerobic respiration (1), which cannot happen without the decomposition of organic matter (2).

However, it incorrectly states that the reduction in dissolved oxygen (4) occurs before the increase in decomposition (2) and respiration by decomposers (1). The reduction in dissolved oxygen is a direct consequence of the metabolic activity of the decomposers; therefore, increased decomposition and respiration must happen before oxygen levels drop significantly."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_438.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "38 which word describes the number of different species in an area?\na biodiversity\nb community\nc ecosystem\nd_ population", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nBiodiversity, short for biological diversity, is the term used to describe the variety and variability of life on Earth.

Less pesticide is used if the genetically modified crop is resistant to pests.**\n\nThis statement describes a significant advantage of genetic modification. Certain crops, such as Bt cotton and Bt corn, have been genetically engineered to produce a protein (from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis*, or Bt) that is toxic to specific insect pests. When these pests attempt to feed on the crop, they ingest the toxin and are killed. As the plant has its own built-in defence mechanism, farmers do not need to apply as many chemical pesticides. This reduction in pesticide use is advantageous because it lowers farming costs, minimises environmental damage caused by chemical runoff, and reduces the risk of harm to non-target organisms, including beneficial insects and humans.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. More herbicide is used if the genetically modified crop is resistant to herbicide.**\n\nThis statement describes a potential disadvantage, not an advantage. Some crops are genetically modified to be resistant to specific broad-spectrum herbicides (e.g., glyphosate). This allows farmers to spray the entire field with the herbicide to kill weeds without harming the crop. While this simplifies weed management, it can lead to an increased reliance on and use of that single herbicide. The widespread use of a particular herbicide can lead to the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, requiring even greater amounts or different chemicals to be used in the future. Increased chemical application is generally considered an environmental drawback.\n\n**C. Seeds for genetically modified crops are more expensive.**\n\nThis is a well-established economic disadvantage of using genetically modified (GM) crops. The research, development, and testing required to create GM seeds are costly processes. The companies that develop these seeds hold patents on their technology and pass these costs on to the farmer, resulting in a higher price for GM seeds compared to conventional seeds. This increased initial investment is a disadvantage for farmers.\n\n**D. The genetically modified crop genes may be passed to other plants.**\n\nThis statement describes a significant ecological risk and a disadvantage of genetically modified crops. This process, known as gene flow or outcrossing, can occur when pollen from a GM crop is carried by wind or insects to related wild plants or to non-GM crops in nearby fields. If the modified gene (e.g., for herbicide resistance) is transferred to a wild relative, it could create a highly resilient weed (\"superweed\") that is difficult to control.

Ribosomes are cellular organelles that act as the site of protein synthesis. They bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) and read its genetic code. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between specific amino acids, which are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA). This sequential linking of amino acids creates a polypeptide chain, which is the primary structure of a protein.\n\n**Statement 5: The sequence of amino acids is determined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA.**\nThis statement describes the fundamental principle of the genetic code. The sequence of nucleotide bases in mRNA is read in groups of three, known as codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid (with some codons acting as start or stop signals). Therefore, the specific order of codons along the mRNA molecule dictates the precise sequence in which amino acids are joined together to form the protein.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**Statement 1: Amino acids are made by the ribosomes.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Ribosomes are responsible for polymerising amino acids into proteins, but they do not synthesise the amino acids themselves. Amino acids are the monomers (building blocks) of proteins. They are either obtained from the diet (essential amino acids) or synthesised from other molecules in the cell through different metabolic pathways.\n\n**Statement 2: mRNA is copied.**\nThis phrasing is imprecise and misleading. During protein synthesis, mRNA is not copied. Instead, mRNA is *synthesised* during a process called transcription, where a segment of DNA (a gene) serves as a template. The genetic information from the DNA is transcribed into a complementary mRNA molecule.\n\n**Statement 3: The gene coding for the protein moves into the nucleus.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In eukaryotic cells, genes are segments of DNA located on chromosomes, which are already housed within the nucleus. The DNA itself does not move into the nucleus; it remains there.

In this state, the movement of water molecules into the cells is balanced by the movement of water molecules out of the cells. Consequently, there is no net movement of water by osmosis, and the length of the potato cylinder does not change. This point of equilibrium is represented on the graph where the curve crosses the horizontal axis (0% change in length). Although the graph shows a slight increase in length at 0.2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, this option describes the key concept of equilibrium that is central to this experiment, which occurs at the nearby concentration of 0.25 mol dm\u207b\u00b3.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: The cells in the potato cylinders became flaccid.**\nThis is incorrect. The graph shows that at a sucrose concentration of 0.2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, the potato cylinders experienced a positive percentage change in length (approximately +1.0%). This indicates that the surrounding solution had a higher water potential than the potato cells, causing the cells to gain water through osmosis. When plant cells gain water, they swell and become firm, or turgid. Flaccidity is a state caused by water loss, which would result in a decrease in length (a negative percentage change).\n\n**B: The cells in the potato cylinders became plasmolysed.**\nThis is incorrect. Plasmolysis is the condition where the cell membrane and cytoplasm shrink and pull away from the cell wall due to severe water loss. This occurs when a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution (a solution with a much lower water potential). The graph indicates that at 0.2 mol dm\u207b\u00b3, the potato cells gained water and increased in length. This is the opposite of the water loss that leads to plasmolysis.\n\n**D: The water potential of the potato cells was zero.**\nThis is incorrect. Water potential is a measure of the potential energy of water, and by convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperature and pressure is defined as zero. All solutions, including the cytoplasm of potato cells, contain dissolved solutes. These solutes lower the water potential, making it a negative value.

In a chemical system, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the constituent molecules. As temperature increases, molecules absorb thermal energy, causing them to move faster and vibrate more vigorously. This means their kinetic energy increases. On the provided graph, the x-axis represents temperature, increasing from left to right. Point D is the furthest point to the right, representing the highest temperature shown. Therefore, at point D, both the enzyme and substrate molecules possess the most kinetic energy. Although the reaction rate has dropped to zero at this point due to the enzyme being fully denatured, the molecules themselves are moving at their fastest.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nPoint A is located at the lowest temperature on the graph. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to temperature, the enzyme and substrate molecules at point A have the least amount of kinetic energy. This low kinetic energy results in slower movement and fewer frequent collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules, which explains the very low rate of reaction seen at this point.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nPoint B represents the optimal temperature for this enzyme, which is the temperature at which the rate of reaction is at its maximum. At this temperature, the molecules have significant kinetic energy, leading to a high frequency of successful collisions between the enzyme's active site and the substrate. However, the temperature at point B is not the highest on the graph. As the temperature continues to rise past point B, the kinetic energy of the molecules will also continue to increase.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nPoint C is at a temperature that is higher than the optimal temperature (B), but lower than the temperature at point D. Consequently, the molecules at point C have more kinetic energy than those at point B, but less than those at point D. The rate of reaction is decreasing at point C because the high temperature is causing the enzyme to denature. The bonds holding the enzyme in its specific three-dimensional shape are breaking, altering the shape of the active site and making it less effective at binding to the substrate."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_450.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "10 which substance is an energy store that is made in plant cells from the products of\nphotosynthesis?\na cellulose\nb_ glycogen\nc_ nectar\nds starch", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. starch\n\n**Explanation:**\nPhotosynthesis in plant cells produces glucose, a simple sugar. This glucose can be used immediately by the plant for cellular respiration to release energy. However, plants often produce more glucose than they need at that moment. To store this excess energy, the plant converts the soluble glucose molecules into a large, insoluble polysaccharide called starch. Starch is an ideal storage molecule because its insolubility prevents it from affecting the water potential of the cell, and its large size means it cannot diffuse out of the storage areas (such as amyloplasts in roots, stems, and seeds). When the plant requires energy, enzymes can break down the starch back into glucose, which can then be used for respiration.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. cellulose:**\nCellulose is also a polysaccharide made from glucose units, similar to starch. However, its primary function is structural, not energy storage. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls, providing rigidity and support to the plant cell. The chemical bonds linking the glucose units in cellulose are different from those in starch, making it very difficult for plants (and most animals) to break down and release energy. Therefore, it is a structural carbohydrate, not an energy store.\n\n**B. glycogen:**\nGlycogen is a polysaccharide that functions as a short-term energy store. It is made from glucose units, much like starch. However, glycogen is the primary energy storage carbohydrate found in animals and fungi, not in plants. In vertebrates, it is stored mainly in the liver and muscle cells. Plants use starch for energy storage, not glycogen.\n\n**C. nectar:**\nNectar is a sugar-rich liquid, containing sucrose, glucose, and fructose, which are products derived from photosynthesis. However, nectar is not an internal energy store for the plant's own use. It is produced by flowers in glands called nectaries for the specific purpose of attracting pollinators, such as insects, birds, and bats. It is an energy reward that is secreted from the plant, rather than a substance stored within its cells for future metabolic needs."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_451.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "11. which nutrient is lacking when a person has scurvy?\na calcium\nbiron\nc_ vitamin c\nd_ vitamin d", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nScurvy is a disease directly resulting from a prolonged deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, which is a vital structural protein found in various connective tissues throughout the body, including skin, blood vessels, cartilage, and bones. Without sufficient vitamin C, the body cannot produce or maintain collagen properly. This leads to weakened connective tissues, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of scurvy, such as swollen and bleeding gums, poor wound healing, joint pain, and fragile blood vessels that cause easy bruising.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nA deficiency in calcium does not cause scurvy. Calcium is a mineral that is crucial for the formation and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It also plays a key role in muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. A lack of calcium, particularly when combined with insufficient vitamin D, leads to skeletal conditions like rickets in children (softening and weakening of bones) or osteoporosis in adults (increased bone fragility).\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nAn iron deficiency does not cause scurvy. Iron is a mineral that is a fundamental component of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that binds to and transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. A lack of dietary iron leads to iron-deficiency anaemia, a condition characterised by fatigue, weakness, and pale skin, all resulting from the blood's reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nA deficiency in vitamin D does not cause scurvy. Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the gut, which are minerals critical for building and maintaining healthy bones. A lack of vitamin D can lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia (softening of the bones) in adults because the body cannot effectively mineralise the bone matrix.

This imbalance leads to a loss of turgor pressure within the plant cells. Specifically, water loss at the leaf surface, a process known as transpiration, is high. Concurrently, the water uptake by the roots from the soil is low, often due to dry soil conditions. This net loss of water from the plant causes the vacuoles within the cells to shrink and the cytoplasm to pull away from the cell wall. As a result, the cells lose their firmness and become flaccid. The collective flaccidity of the cells in non-woody tissues, such as leaves and young stems, results in the visible drooping or wilting of the plant.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because the conditions described\u2014low water loss and high water uptake\u2014would lead to a net gain of water by the plant. This would cause the plant cells to become firm and turgid due to high turgor pressure, not flaccid. The combination of these conditions with flaccid cells is contradictory.\n\n**B:** This option describes the state of a healthy, well-watered plant. When water uptake in the roots is high and water loss at the leaf surface is low, the plant cells will be full of water, resulting in high turgor pressure. This makes the cells turgid, keeping the plant firm and upright. This is the opposite of a wilting plant.\n\n**D:** While this option correctly identifies the water balance that causes wilting (high water loss and low water uptake), it incorrectly states the resulting condition of the plant cells. A net loss of water from the cells causes them to lose turgor pressure and become flaccid. Turgid cells are firm and swollen with water, which is the opposite state of cells in a wilted plant.

Veins are adapted for this function with a large lumen, thin walls, and valves.\n\n*   **Large lumen:** A wide central channel (lumen) provides less resistance to blood flow. This is important because the pressure of the blood returning to the heart is low, and a larger passage facilitates its movement.\n*   **Thin wall:** Veins have thinner muscular and elastic walls compared to arteries because they do not need to withstand high pressure. The blood pressure has significantly decreased by the time it reaches the veins after passing through the extensive network of capillaries.\n*   **Valves:** Veins, particularly those in the limbs, contain valves. These are flap-like structures that allow blood to flow towards the heart but prevent it from flowing backwards due to the low pressure and the pull of gravity.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A**\nThis option describes a vessel with a large lumen and a thick wall. This combination is not typical of any blood vessel. Thick walls are a feature of arteries, which withstand high pressure, but arteries have a relatively narrow lumen to maintain that pressure. A large lumen is characteristic of veins, which have thin walls due to low pressure.\n\n**B**\nThis option describes a vessel with a small lumen, a thin wall, and valves. This is an inconsistent combination of features. A small lumen is characteristic of an artery or a capillary. Thin walls are found in capillaries and veins. Valves are found in veins. No single blood vessel possesses all three of these features. For example, while capillaries have a small lumen and thin walls, they lack valves.\n\n**C**\nThis option describes a vessel with a small lumen, a thick wall, and an absence of valves. These are the characteristic features of an artery, which transports blood *away* from the heart at *high pressure*. The thick, muscular, and elastic wall is essential to withstand and maintain high pressure, while the narrow lumen helps keep the pressure high.

Its primary function is to protect the body by engulfing and digesting harmful foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as dead or dying cells. This process is called phagocytosis. A key identifying feature of a phagocyte, specifically a neutrophil which is the most common type, is its multi-lobed nucleus. This distinctive nuclear structure allows the cell to be flexible and squeeze through the walls of blood vessels to reach sites of infection.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: lymphocyte**\nA lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell involved in the specific immune response, primarily by producing antibodies or coordinating the immune attack. Structurally, a lymphocyte is characterized by a very large, spherical nucleus that occupies most of the cell's volume, leaving only a thin rim of cytoplasm. This appearance is distinctly different from the multi-lobed nucleus typical of a phagocyte.\n\n**C: platelet**\nPlatelets, or thrombocytes, are not complete cells but are small, irregular-shaped fragments derived from large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes. Their primary function is to initiate blood clotting at the site of an injury. Crucially, platelets lack a nucleus. The component shown clearly possesses a large, complex nucleus, which definitively rules it out as a platelet.\n\n**D: red blood cell**\nA mature red blood cell (erythrocyte) is specialized for oxygen transport. To maximize its capacity for carrying haemoglobin, the protein that binds to oxygen, it expels its nucleus during maturation. Consequently, mature mammalian red blood cells lack a nucleus and have a characteristic biconcave disc shape.

Antibodies are produced by lymphocytes.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Antibodies are specialised proteins that are a crucial component of the adaptive immune system. They are produced by a specific type of white blood cell called a B lymphocyte (or B cell). When a B lymphocyte encounters a pathogen with a specific, matching antigen on its surface, it becomes activated. This activated B lymphocyte then divides and differentiates into plasma cells. Plasma cells are essentially antibody-producing factories, manufacturing and secreting large quantities of antibodies into the blood and lymph, where they can target and help eliminate the pathogens.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Antibodies are present on the surface of pathogens.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The molecules present on the surface of pathogens that trigger an immune response are called **antigens**. Antigens are recognised by the immune system as foreign. In response to these antigens, the body's lymphocytes produce **antibodies**. Antibodies then bind specifically to these antigens, marking the pathogen for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Therefore, antigens are on the pathogen, while antibodies are produced by the host's immune cells.\n\n**C. Antigens are produced by memory cells.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. **Antigens** are molecules, usually proteins or polysaccharides, found on the surface of pathogens or other foreign substances. They are not produced by the host's body cells. **Memory cells** are a type of long-lived lymphocyte (both B and T cells) that are produced during a primary immune response. Their function is to \"remember\" a specific antigen. If the same pathogen enters the body again, these memory cells can mount a much faster and more effective secondary immune response. Memory cells recognise antigens; they do not produce them.\n\n**D. Antigens are produced by phagocytes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. **Antigens** are foreign molecules characteristic of a pathogen, not substances produced by the body's own immune cells. **Phagocytes** are a type of white blood cell (such as macrophages) that engulf and digest pathogens in a non-specific process called phagocytosis. After engulfing a pathogen, some phagocytes (called antigen-presenting cells) can display fragments of the pathogen's antigens on their own cell surface to help activate the adaptive immune response, but they do not synthesise or produce the antigens themselves."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_462.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "22 the intercostal muscles and diaphragm contract and relax during ventilation.\nwhich row shows the actions of muscles that result in the largest volume inside the thorax?\ninternal intercostal .\ndiaphragm\nmuscles\na relax contract\nb relax relax\ncc contract contract\nd contract relax", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe largest volume inside the thorax is achieved during inhalation (breathing in). This process requires the coordinated action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to expand the thoracic cavity.\n\n1.  **Diaphragm:** During inhalation, the diaphragm, a large dome-shaped muscle at the base of the thorax, contracts and flattens. This movement increases the vertical dimension (height) of the thoracic cavity.\n2.  **Intercostal Muscles:** There are two sets of intercostal muscles: external and internal. They work as an antagonistic pair. For inhalation, the external intercostal muscles contract, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards. Simultaneously, the internal intercostal muscles must relax to allow this expansion to occur.\n\nThis combination\u2014a contracted, flattened diaphragm and relaxed internal intercostal muscles (allowing the external intercostals to lift the ribs)\u2014maximises the volume of the thoracic cavity. The increased volume lowers the pressure inside the lungs relative to the atmosphere, causing air to flow in.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: internal intercostal muscles relax, diaphragm relax**\nThis combination of muscle actions occurs during quiet, passive exhalation (breathing out). While the internal intercostal muscles are relaxed, the diaphragm is also relaxed. A relaxed diaphragm is dome-shaped, moving upwards and reducing the vertical volume of the thoracic cavity. This leads to a decrease, not an increase, in thoracic volume.\n\n**C: internal intercostal muscles contract, diaphragm contract**\nThese two actions are antagonistic and do not occur together to maximise thoracic volume. The contraction of the diaphragm acts to increase thoracic volume (for inhalation), while the contraction of the internal intercostal muscles acts to decrease thoracic volume by pulling the rib cage down and in (for forced exhalation). These opposing actions would not result in the largest possible volume.\n\n**D: internal intercostal muscles contract, diaphragm relax**\nThis combination of muscle actions occurs during forced exhalation, such as when coughing or exercising vigorously. The relaxation of the diaphragm causes it to move up, decreasing the vertical dimension of the thorax. The contraction of the internal intercostal muscles actively pulls the rib cage downwards and inwards. Both actions work to significantly decrease the volume of the thorax, forcing air out of the lungs.

The process begins with the breakdown of excess amino acids, a process known as deamination, which occurs in the liver. During deamination, the amino group is removed from the amino acids, forming ammonia, which is highly toxic. The liver then rapidly converts this toxic ammonia into a less harmful substance, urea, through a series of reactions called the urea cycle. This urea is then released into the bloodstream. The blood is transported to the kidneys, which function as the body's primary filtration system. The kidneys filter waste products, including urea, from the blood to form urine. Therefore, the liver is the site of urea formation, and the kidneys are the organs responsible for its excretion from the blood.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: formed - bladder, excreted - heart**\nThis option is incorrect. The bladder is a muscular organ that serves as a storage reservoir for urine before it is expelled from the body; it does not form urea. The heart is a muscular pump responsible for circulating blood throughout the body and is not an excretory organ.\n\n**B: formed - heart, excreted - liver**\nThis option is incorrect. The heart's function is to pump blood; it is not involved in the synthesis of metabolic waste products like urea.

A high concentration of auxin stimulates cell elongation on the lower side of the shoot.**\n\nThis statement is the correct conclusion drawn from the behaviour of the shoot. In the experiment, the seedling is placed horizontally, and gravity causes the plant hormone auxin to accumulate on the lower side of both the shoot and the root. The diagram shows the shoot bending upwards. This upward growth, known as negative gravitropism, occurs because the cells on the lower side of theshoot have elongated more rapidly and to a greater extent than the cells on the upper side. Since the concentration of auxin is highest on this lower side, it can be concluded that a high concentration of auxin stimulates cell elongation in shoot tissues.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. A high concentration of auxin stimulates cell elongation on the lower side of the root.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The diagram shows the root bending downwards, which is known as positive gravitropism. This downward curvature is caused by the cells on the *upper* side of the root elongating more than the cells on the lower side. As the question states, auxin is concentrated on the lower side of the root. Therefore, the high concentration of auxin on the lower side has *inhibited* cell elongation, while the lower concentration on the upper side has allowed for more rapid elongation.\n\n**C. A low concentration of auxin stimulates cell elongation on the upper side of the shoot.**\n\nThis statement is not the best conclusion from the evidence. While the cells on the upper side of the shoot do elongate, the diagram clearly shows that the upward bending is caused by a *greater* degree of elongation on the lower side. The primary conclusion is that the high concentration of auxin on the lower side has a strong stimulatory effect, causing the differential growth that leads to bending. The effect of the low concentration on the upper side is less significant in explaining the observed curvature.\n\n**D. A low concentration of auxin stimulates cell elongation on the upper sides of the shoot and the root.**\n\nThis statement is a flawed generalisation. For the root, it is correct that the lower concentration of auxin on the upper side promotes more cell elongation compared to the inhibitory high concentration on the lower side. However, for the shoot, the *high* concentration of auxin on the lower side causes *more* elongation than the low concentration on the upper side.

After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which causes the uterine lining to become thick, glandular, and rich in blood vessels, preparing it for the implantation of a fertilised egg. If implantation occurs, the developing placenta takes over the production of progesterone. High levels of progesterone are maintained throughout pregnancy to ensure the endometrium remains intact to nourish the developing foetus. It also inhibits uterine contractions, preventing premature birth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)**\nFollicle-stimulating hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland and its primary role is to stimulate the development of follicles in the ovaries at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. During pregnancy, high levels of progesterone inhibit the secretion of FSH, preventing the maturation of new follicles and ovulation. Therefore, FSH is not involved in maintaining the uterine lining.\n\n**B: luteinising hormone (LH)**\nLuteinising hormone is also secreted by the pituitary gland. A surge in LH triggers ovulation and stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum from the remnants of the follicle. The corpus luteum then produces progesterone. However, similar to FSH, the high levels of progesterone during pregnancy suppress LH secretion. Its primary role occurs before pregnancy is established, and it does not directly maintain the uterine lining throughout gestation.\n\n**C: oestrogen**\nOestrogen is responsible for the initial repair and proliferation (thickening) of the uterine lining after menstruation.

Condoms are a barrier method that prevents the sexual transmission of HIV. If their price increased, they would become less accessible and affordable, potentially leading to decreased use. A reduction in condom use would increase the risk of transmission, which contradicts the observed decrease in new infections.\n\n**B. People in 2021 had more sexual partners.**\nThis statement is incorrect as it describes a behaviour that increases the risk of contracting HIV.

Ribosomes are small organelles located in the cytoplasm and on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

While the mass of DNA doubles during interphase (from 2C to 4C in a diploid cell), the chromosome number (2n) remains the same, so the cell remains diploid throughout.\n\n**B: the cell is dividing**\nCell division, which includes mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division), is the process where one cell splits into two. On this graph, the actual division is represented by the steep vertical drop after the plateau. This drop signifies the halving of the DNA mass as it is partitioned into two separate daughter cells. The section at X shows the DNA mass increasing in preparation for division, not the division process itself.\n\n**D: reduction division**\nReduction division is a term for meiosis I, the process where the number of chromosomes is halved (e.g., from diploid to haploid). This is characteristic of the formation of gametes (sex cells). The graph, however, describes the events surrounding **mitosis**. Mitosis is an equational division, meaning the daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The graph confirms this, as the mass of DNA per cell returns to its original starting level after division, indicating the chromosome number has been maintained."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_472.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "32 a woman who has blood group ab has a child with a man who has blood group b and is\nheterozygous.\nwhat is the chance of the child having blood group b?\na 0% b 25% c 50% d 100%", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### **Explanation of the Correct Answer**\n\n**C. 50%**\n\nThis question involves the principles of Mendelian genetics, specifically codominance and multiple alleles as seen in the ABO blood group system.\n\n1.  **Determine Parental Genotypes:**\n    *   Human blood groups are determined by three alleles: I^A, I^B, and i.\n    *   A woman with blood group AB has the genotype **I^A I^B**.

A child can inherit the I^B allele from the mother and the i allele from the father (resulting in genotype I^B i) or the I^B allele from both parents (resulting in genotype I^B I^B). Both of these genotypes lead to blood group B, so it is possible for the child to have this blood type.\n\n**B. 25%**\nThis is incorrect. While the chance of having the specific genotype I^B I^B is 25%, and the chance of having the genotype I^B i is also 25%, the question asks for the chance of having the *phenotype* blood group B. Since both of these genotypes result in the blood group B phenotype, their probabilities must be added together (25% + 25% = 50%).\n\n**D. 100%**\nThis is incorrect. As shown by the Punnett square, there are other possible outcomes. The child has a 25% chance of inheriting the I^A allele from the mother and the i allele from the father, resulting in blood group A (genotype I^A i). The child also has a 25% chance of inheriting the I^A allele from the mother and the I^B allele from the father, resulting in blood group AB (genotype I^A I^B).

To conserve water, they have evolved specific features to minimise water loss through transpiration. A **thick, waxy cuticle** on the leaf surface acts as a waterproof barrier, significantly reducing water loss through evaporation from the epidermal cells (cuticular transpiration). Additionally, having **few stomata** reduces the number of pores through which water vapour can escape (stomatal transpiration). This combination of a thick cuticle and a low number of stomata is a crucial adaptation for minimising water loss and ensuring survival in dry conditions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nWhile a **thick cuticle** is a key adaptation for a xerophyte to reduce water loss from the leaf surface, having **many stomata** would be counter-productive. Stomata are the primary sites of transpiration. A large number of stomata would create numerous openings for water vapour to exit the leaf, leading to a high rate of water loss, which is detrimental for a plant in a dry environment. Therefore, this combination of features is not characteristic of a xerophyte.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nHaving **few stomata** is an effective adaptation for a xerophyte as it reduces the surface area available for water loss through transpiration. However, a **thin cuticle** would provide an insufficient barrier against water loss. A thin, waxy layer would allow for a significant amount of water to evaporate directly from the leaf's surface, undermining the water-saving benefit of having fewer stomata. This would not be an effective overall strategy for water conservation in an arid habitat.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option describes features that would lead to maximum water loss, which is the opposite of what a xerophyte requires. A **thin cuticle** offers minimal protection against evaporation from the leaf surface, and **many stomata** provide a large surface area for water vapour to diffuse out of the leaf during transpiration. These characteristics are typical of hydrophytes (plants living in water) or mesophytes in moist, humid environments where water conservation is not a priority and maximising gas exchange for photosynthesis is more important."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_474.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_21.pdf", "questionText": "34 which diagram correctly shows the flow of energy?\na producers \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014> consumers\ndecomposers\nb consumers \u2014\u2014\u2014* producers \u2014\u2014\u2014\u00ae decomposers\nc producers \u00ab\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 _ consumers\ndecomposers\nd decomposers \u2014\u2014\u2014\u00ae consumers \u2014\u2014\u2014+\u00bb producers", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThis diagram correctly illustrates the flow of energy through an ecosystem. Energy originates from an external source, typically the sun, and is captured by producers through photosynthesis. The arrow from producers to consumers indicates that energy is transferred when consumers eat producers. When producers and consumers die, the chemical energy stored in their tissues is transferred to decomposers, which break down the dead organic matter. Therefore, arrows correctly point from both producers and consumers to decomposers, representing this final energy transfer pathway.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nThis diagram incorrectly shows energy flowing from consumers to producers. Producers (like plants) are autotrophs, meaning they create their own food and capture energy from sunlight. Consumers are heterotrophs that obtain energy by consuming other organisms. Therefore, energy must flow from producers to consumers, not the other way around.\n\n#### C\nThis diagram contains two incorrect representations of energy flow. Firstly, it incorrectly shows energy flowing from consumers to producers. Secondly, it incorrectly shows energy flowing from decomposers to producers. While decomposers break down dead organic matter and release essential nutrients that producers absorb, this is a part of nutrient cycling, not energy flow. Producers do not obtain energy from decomposers; their primary energy source is sunlight.\n\n#### D\nThis diagram shows a completely reversed and incorrect model of energy flow.

Therefore, the base of the pyramid, representing the number of producers, is very small.\n2.  **Primary Consumers (Small Insects):** This single tree can support a very large number of small insects that feed on its leaves, bark, or sap. This trophic level has the highest number of individuals, resulting in the widest bar in the pyramid.\n3.  **Secondary Consumers (Small Birds):** The large population of insects can support a smaller population of small birds.

This shape implies that the number of organisms is greatest at the producer level and decreases at each successive trophic level. While this is common for many food chains (e.g., grass \u2192 rabbits \u2192 foxes), it is incorrect for the food chain given. The producer is a single tree, which is a much smaller number than the multitude of insects it supports. Therefore, the base of the pyramid should be the narrowest or one of the narrowest, not the widest.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the relative numbers of organisms in the food chain. It suggests that the numbers of trees, small insects, and small birds are all large and roughly equal. This is biologically unfeasible. Due to the significant loss of energy at each trophic transfer (only about 10% is passed on), a given number of organisms can only support a much smaller number of predators. Therefore, the number of small birds must be considerably less than the number of small insects they consume.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis diagram shows a fully inverted pyramid of numbers, where the number of organisms increases at each successive trophic level. While the base is correctly shown as small (one tree) and the next level is larger (many insects), the pyramid incorrectly continues to widen. This would imply that there are more small birds than insects, and more birds of prey than small birds.

The question states that acidic soils encourage the growth of these bacteria. An increased population of denitrifying bacteria leads to a higher rate of denitrification. Consequently, more nitrates are converted into nitrogen gas, which is then released from the soil into the atmosphere, effectively removing usable nitrogen from the soil ecosystem.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: Ammonia will not enter the nitrogen cycle.**\nThis is incorrect. Ammonia (or ammonium ions) enters the nitrogen cycle through two main processes: nitrogen fixation, carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and ammonification, the decomposition of organic matter by bacteria and fungi. The information provided concerns denitrification, which occurs later in the cycle after ammonia has been converted to nitrates. While extreme soil pH can affect all microbial processes, the statement implies a complete stop to ammonia's entry, which is not a direct or necessary consequence of increased denitrification.\n\n**C: The concentration of nitrates in the soil will increase.**\nThis is incorrect. Denitrification is a process that *consumes* nitrates. Denitrifying bacteria use nitrates as a source of oxygen for respiration in anaerobic conditions, converting them into nitrogen gas (N\u2082). Therefore, an increase in the activity of these bacteria would lead to a more rapid removal of nitrates from the soil, causing their concentration to *decrease*, not increase.\n\n**D: The plants growing in the soil will produce more proteins.**\nThis is incorrect. Plants absorb nitrogen, primarily in the form of nitrates, from the soil to synthesize amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Increased denitrification reduces the amount of available nitrates in the soil. With a diminished supply of this essential nutrient, plant growth and protein synthesis would be limited, not enhanced.

During this phase, the graph shows a plateau where the total number of yeast cells remains constant over time. This stability occurs because the rate of new cell production (through asexual reproduction, or budding) is equal to the rate of cell death. The population has reached the carrying capacity of its environment, meaning that limiting factors such as nutrient depletion, accumulation of toxic waste products (e.g., ethanol), and lack of space prevent further population growth.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:**\nPhase A is the **lag phase**. In this phase, the population growth is very slow. Although the population is increasing, indicating that the rate of cell production is slightly higher than the rate of death, the yeast cells are primarily adapting to the new environment. They are synthesising the necessary enzymes and molecules required for growth and division. Therefore, the rate of production is not yet maximised and is not equal to the death rate.\n\n**B:**\nPhase B is the **exponential or log phase**. This phase is characterised by a steep, upward curve, indicating a rapid increase in the number of yeast cells. This occurs because environmental conditions are optimal, with abundant nutrients and space, and a low concentration of waste products. Consequently, the rate of cell production is significantly greater than the rate of cell death, leading to exponential population growth.\n\n**D:**\nPhase D is the **death or decline phase**. The downward slope of the graph in this phase indicates that the total population of yeast cells is decreasing. This happens when the rate of cell death exceeds the rate of new cell production.

To establish a monoculture, the natural ecosystem, which typically contains a wide variety of plant species, is cleared. This action directly reduces the variety of plants. Consequently, the various animals, insects, and microorganisms that depended on the original diverse flora for food and shelter can no longer survive in the area. This leads to a significant reduction in biodiversity, which is the variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem. Loss of biodiversity is a major negative environmental impact as it can destabilise the ecosystem, making it more vulnerable to disease and reducing its overall health and resilience.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Fewer types of pesticide are needed.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Monocultures are highly susceptible to pests and diseases. When a single plant species is grown in high density, any pest or pathogen that specialises in that plant has an abundant and readily available food source, allowing its population to grow and spread rapidly. This often necessitates the increased and repeated application of pesticides to prevent catastrophic crop loss. While it might be a specific type of pesticide, the overall dependency on and quantity of pesticide used is often greater, which has its own negative environmental consequences.\n\n**C. Larger harvests can be produced.**\nWhile it is true that monocultures can lead to larger harvests and higher yields of a specific crop, this is an economic advantage of this farming method, not a negative environmental impact. The system is designed for maximum efficiency and production of a single commodity. The question specifically asks for a *negative environmental* consequence.\n\n**D. Specialist machinery can be used.**\nThe ability to use large, specialist machinery (like combine harvesters and large-scale sprayers) is a primary reason why monoculture is practised.

The removal of trees means there is no canopy to intercept rainfall, leading to more water reaching the ground directly and causing greater surface runoff. The extensive root systems of trees, which bind the soil and increase its water absorption capacity, are also lost. This combination of increased surface runoff and reduced water absorption by the soil significantly increases the likelihood and severity of flooding.\n\nFurthermore, without the protective canopy and the binding action of tree roots, the topsoil is exposed to erosion by wind and rain. The increased surface runoff washes away the fertile topsoil, leading to an increased loss of soil.\n\nTranspiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves. Since deforestation involves the large-scale removal of trees, there are far fewer plants to carry out transpiration. Consequently, the overall rate of transpiration in the area decreases significantly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that deforestation decreases flooding and soil loss, and increases transpiration. In reality, deforestation has the opposite effect on all three processes. The removal of trees exacerbates flooding and soil erosion and reduces the amount of water released into the atmosphere via transpiration.\n\n**B:** This option correctly identifies that transpiration will decrease but incorrectly suggests that flooding will also decrease. The removal of trees reduces the land's ability to absorb rainwater, which increases surface runoff and leads to a greater risk of flooding, not a decrease.\n\n**C:** This option correctly states that flooding will increase, but it is incorrect about the effects on soil loss and transpiration. Deforestation leads to an increase, not a decrease, in soil loss because the soil is no longer held in place by tree roots.

The process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 2: Extract the gene for insulin from human DNA with restriction enzymes.** The first step is to isolate the desired gene. A specific restriction enzyme is used to cut the insulin gene from the human chromosome, creating specific single-stranded overhangs known as 'sticky ends'.\n2.  **Step 1: Cut bacterial plasmid DNA with restriction enzymes.** A plasmid, which is a small circular piece of DNA from a bacterium, is used as a vector to carry the gene. The same restriction enzyme is used to cut the plasmid, ensuring it has sticky ends that are complementary to those of the insulin gene.\n3.  **Step 4: Join human DNA to bacterial plasmid DNA using DNA ligase.** The isolated insulin gene is mixed with the cut plasmids. The complementary sticky ends anneal (pair up), and the enzyme DNA ligase is added to form strong phosphodiester bonds, permanently joining the gene into the plasmid. This creates a recombinant plasmid.\n4.  **Step 3: Insert the recombinant plasmids into bacteria.** The recombinant plasmids are introduced into host bacteria in a process called transformation. Not all bacteria will successfully take up a plasmid.\n5.  **Step 5: Replicate bacteria containing recombinant plasmids.** The transformed bacteria are cultured in a large fermenter.

This is a multi-step metabolic process that breaks down glucose and other organic molecules in the presence of oxygen. The chemical energy stored within these molecules is converted into a form of energy that the cell can readily use, called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This release of energy in the form of ATP powers nearly all cellular activities, such as muscle contraction, active transport, and synthesis of macromolecules. For this reason, mitochondria are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. to absorb light energy**\nThe absorption of light energy is the primary function of chloroplasts, not mitochondria. Chloroplasts contain the pigment chlorophyll, which captures light energy from the sun. This energy is then used to drive the process of photosynthesis. This function is characteristic of plant cells and some protists, whereas mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells, including those of animals and fungi, which do not perform photosynthesis.\n\n**B. to produce glucose**\nThe production of glucose occurs during photosynthesis, a process carried out in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Using the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose, which serves as a store of chemical energy for the plant. Mitochondria perform the opposite function: they break down glucose during cellular respiration to release its stored energy.\n\n**D. to transport oxygen**\nMitochondria utilise oxygen as the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration, but they do not transport it. In vertebrate animals, oxygen is transported from the lungs to the body's cells by a specialized protein called haemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells. Once oxygen diffuses from the blood into a cell, it then diffuses to the mitochondria where it is consumed during the process of energy release."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_485.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_22.pdf", "questionText": "5 which row shows a function of the cell membrane and a function of the cell wall in a palisade\ncell?\n[| eetimembrane | eatwa\na active transport active transport\nb active transport support\ncc support active transport\nd support support", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that regulates the passage of substances into and out of the cell. One of its key functions is active transport, which is the movement of molecules or ions across the membrane against their concentration gradient. This process requires energy, typically in the form of ATP, and is carried out by specific protein carriers embedded in the membrane. The cell wall, located outside the cell membrane in plant cells, is a rigid structure composed mainly of cellulose. Its primary function is to provide structural support, maintain the cell's shape, and protect it from mechanical stress and excessive water uptake, which prevents the cell from bursting.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** While the cell membrane does perform active transport, the cell wall does not. The cell wall is a fully permeable structure that does not regulate the passage of solutes. Active transport is a feature of the selectively permeable cell membrane, not the rigid, non-selective cell wall.\n\n**C:** This option incorrectly assigns the functions. The cell membrane is a thin, flexible bilayer and does not provide significant structural support; this is the primary role of the cell wall. Conversely, the cell wall is a non-living, fully permeable layer and is not involved in active transport.\n\n**D:** Although the cell wall correctly provides support, the cell membrane's primary function is not support.

According to the rules of complementary base pairing, Adenine pairs exclusively with Thymine (T). Both Adenine and Guanine are classified as purines, which are larger, two-ringed molecules. A pairing between two purines would disrupt the uniform width of the DNA helix, creating a bulge and destabilizing the structure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nA Guanine (G) base does not pair with another Guanine base. DNA base pairing occurs between a base on one strand and its complementary partner on the opposite strand. Guanine is a purine and its specific complementary partner is the pyrimidine Cytosine (C).

Therefore, the greatest rate of digestion corresponds to the shortest time taken for complete digestion. The lowest point on the curve represents the minimum time for digestion, which occurs at a temperature of 40\u00b0C. This temperature is the optimum temperature for the enzyme responsible for starch digestion (amylase). At this temperature, the enzyme has its ideal three-dimensional shape, and the kinetic energy of both enzyme and substrate molecules is optimal, leading to the highest frequency of successful collisions between the active site and the starch molecules. This results in the fastest rate of reaction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** At 10\u00b0C, the time taken for digestion is the longest shown among the options. This indicates a very slow rate of reaction. At low temperatures, enzyme and substrate molecules have low kinetic energy, resulting in less frequent and less energetic collisions, thus slowing down the rate of digestion.\n\n**B:** At 30\u00b0C, the time taken for digestion is shorter than at 10\u00b0C but significantly longer than at 40\u00b0C. This means the rate of reaction is increasing as the temperature rises and approaches the optimum, but it is not yet the greatest. The kinetic energy of the molecules is higher than at 10\u00b0C, but not yet optimal for the maximum rate of reaction.\n\n**D:** At 50\u00b0C, the time taken for digestion has started to increase again after reaching a minimum at 40\u00b0C. This indicates that the rate of reaction is decreasing. Temperatures above the optimum cause the enzyme to denature. The high thermal energy breaks the weak bonds that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure, altering the shape of the active site.

Without an adequate supply of magnesium, a plant cannot produce chlorophyll, leading to a deficiency symptom known as chlorosis, where the leaves turn yellow.\n\nMagnesium, like other mineral ions, is absorbed from the soil. This absorption occurs primarily through the root hair cells.

Its cells are adapted to maximise light absorption by being packed together and containing numerous chloroplasts. The large central vacuole helps to push the chloroplasts to the periphery of the cell, further optimising their exposure to sunlight.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. leaf epidermis:**\nLeaf epidermal cells form the outermost protective layer of the leaf. Their primary function is to be transparent to allow sunlight to pass through to the underlying mesophyll tissue where photosynthesis occurs. Consequently, leaf epidermal cells (with the exception of guard cells) lack chloroplasts. The cell in the diagram is rich in chloroplasts, which is inconsistent with the structure of a typical epidermal cell.\n\n**C. root epidermis:**\nRoot epidermal cells are found on the surface of plant roots.

The rate of transpiration is driven by the water potential gradient, which is the difference in water vapour concentration between the moist air inside the leaf and the drier air outside.\n\nCool temperatures and high humidity create conditions that result in the lowest rate of transpiration.\n*   **Cool Temperature:** Lower temperatures reduce the kinetic energy of water molecules. This slows down the rate at which water evaporates from the surfaces of the spongy mesophyll cells inside the leaf.\n*   **High Humidity:** When the air surrounding the leaf is already saturated with a high concentration of water vapour, the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside air is very low (shallow). This significantly reduces the rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata.\n\nThe combination of slow evaporation (due to cool temperatures) and a slow rate of diffusion (due to high humidity) leads to the lowest possible rate of water loss from the plant.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. cool and windy:**\nWhile cool temperatures do slow the rate of evaporation, windy conditions increase the rate of transpiration. Wind blows away the layer of humid air (the boundary layer) that accumulates around the stomata. This action maintains a steep water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the surrounding air, promoting faster diffusion of water vapour out of the plant. Therefore, the effect of the wind counteracts the effect of the cool temperature, leading to a higher transpiration rate than in cool, still, and humid conditions.\n\n**C. warm and low humidity:**\nThese conditions lead to a very high rate of transpiration. Warm temperatures increase the kinetic energy of water molecules, causing them to evaporate more rapidly from the leaf's internal surfaces. Low humidity means there is a very low concentration of water vapour in the air outside the leaf. This creates a very steep water potential gradient, causing water vapour to diffuse quickly out of the stomata. The combination of these two factors results in one of the highest rates of water loss.\n\n**D. warm and windy:**\nThese conditions also lead to a very high rate of transpiration. Warm temperatures increase the rate of evaporation inside the leaf. Simultaneously, windy conditions remove the humid boundary layer from the leaf surface, which maintains a steep water potential gradient.

These include both non-specific chemical barriers and specific cellular immune responses.\n\n1.  **Stomach Acid:** The stomach lining secretes hydrochloric acid, creating a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5). This low pH acts as a powerful chemical barrier that kills the vast majority of pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, present in contaminated food. The acid denatures the essential enzymes and proteins of these microorganisms, rendering them non-functional and harmless. This is a crucial component of the body's first line of defence.\n\n2.  **White Blood Cells:** If pathogens manage to survive the acidic conditions of the stomach and enter the intestine, from where they can be absorbed into the bloodstream or tissues, the immune system is activated. White blood cells are the central components of this system. Phagocytes (a type of white blood cell) engulf and digest pathogens in a non-specific process called phagocytosis. Lymphocytes (another type of white blood cell) mount a specific immune response, which includes producing antibodies that target and neutralise the particular pathogen.\n\n3.  **Red Blood Cells:** Red blood cells are not involved in the immune response. Their specialised function is to transport oxygen around the body, bound to the protein haemoglobin.

The function of red blood cells is oxygen transport, not immunity. Additionally, it incorrectly excludes the vital role of white blood cells in fighting pathogens that may survive the stomach acid.\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect because it wrongly includes red blood cells in the body's defence against pathogens and, crucially, excludes the role of stomach acid. The highly acidic environment of the stomach is one of the most important initial defences against foodborne pathogens.\n*   **D:** This option is incorrect because it omits the role of stomach acid.

This is an active process initiated by the contraction of respiratory muscles. The external intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, contract, pulling the rib cage upwards and outwards. Simultaneously, the diaphragm muscle contracts and flattens. These coordinated actions lead to an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. According to Boyle's Law, an increase in volume results in a decrease in pressure. Consequently, the air pressure inside the thorax and lungs becomes lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the body. This pressure gradient causes air to flow from the area of higher pressure (outside) to the area of lower pressure (inside the lungs) until the pressures are equalised.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** While the contraction of the external intercostal muscles is the correct initial step for inhalation, this action causes the volume of the thorax to increase, not decrease. The contraction pulls the rib cage up and out, expanding the chest cavity. A decrease in thoracic volume would occur during exhalation.\n\n**B:** This option describes the process of exhalation (breathing out), not inhalation. During exhalation, the external intercostal muscles relax, allowing the rib cage to move down and inwards. This action, along with the relaxation of the diaphragm, decreases the volume of the thorax. The reduced volume increases the air pressure inside the thorax to a level above atmospheric pressure, forcing air out of the lungs.\n\n**D:** This option presents a physiologically incorrect sequence of events. The relaxation of the external intercostal muscles is part of exhalation and leads to a decrease in the volume of the thorax.

This is significantly less than the 24 cm\u00b3 produced in the first 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of respiration has slowed down and is not the fastest in this interval. The rate decreases as the substrate is consumed, reducing the frequency of enzyme-substrate collisions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe volume of carbon dioxide produced between 20 and 30 minutes is calculated as:\n40 cm\u00b3 (at 30 min) - 37 cm\u00b3 (at 20 min) = 3 cm\u00b3.\n\nProducing 3 cm\u00b3 of carbon dioxide in 10 minutes is a much slower rate than in the earlier stages of the experiment. The rate continues to decrease because the substrate concentration is becoming a limiting factor.

The carbon-containing part of the amino acid, known as the carbon skeleton or keto acid, is what *remains* after deamination.

This is achieved by the dilation (widening) of the pupil. The iris controls the size of the pupil through the action of two sets of muscles: the circular muscles and the radial muscles, which work antagonistically.\n\nTo dilate the pupil, the radial muscles, which are arranged like the spokes of a wheel, must contract. This contraction pulls the inner edge of theiris outwards, increasing the diameter of the pupil. Simultaneously, the circular muscles, which encircle the pupil, must relax. This combination of actions maximises the amount of light entering the eye, which is the correct response for a dimly lit environment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: circular muscles contract, radial muscles contract**\nThis is incorrect because the circular and radial muscles in the iris form an antagonistic pair. Antagonistic muscles work in opposition to each other; when one set contracts, the other relaxes. It is not physiologically possible for both sets to contract at the same time.\n\n**B: circular muscles contract, radial muscles relax**\nThis describes the process of pupil constriction (making the pupil smaller), not dilation.

This is the reflex action that occurs when moving from a dimly lit area to a brightly lit area to limit the amount of light entering the eye and protect the retina.\n\n**D: circular muscles relax, radial muscles relax**\nThis is incorrect because an active change in pupil size requires the contraction of one of the muscle sets.

Adrenaline is a hormone released by the adrenal glands during 'fight or flight' situations (e.g., stress, fear, excitement). It prepares the body for vigorous action. One of its effects is to cause the radial muscles in the iris of the eye to contract. This contraction pulls the pupil open, increasing its diameter (a process called dilation). A wider pupil allows more light to enter the eye, which enhances vision and awareness of the surroundings, a crucial adaptation for responding to a threat.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration.** This statement is correct. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas when blood glucose levels rise, typically after a carbohydrate-rich meal.

This process involves several key components:\n\n1.  **Mutation (3):** The process begins with random changes in the bacterial DNA, known as mutations. By chance, a mutation may arise that provides a bacterium with resistance to an antibiotic. This is the origin of the new, advantageous trait.\n2.  **Genetic Variation (2):** Mutation contributes to the overall genetic variation within a bacterial population. This means that not all bacteria in the population are genetically identical; some may be susceptible to an antibiotic, while a few might carry the resistance mutation.\n3.  **Natural Selection (4):** When the bacterial population is exposed to an antibiotic, this substance acts as a selective pressure. The non-resistant (susceptible) bacteria are killed, while the bacteria with the resistance mutation survive. These surviving bacteria reproduce, passing the resistance gene to their offspring. Over time, the proportion of resistant bacteria in the population increases, leading to the emergence of an antibiotic-resistant strain.\n\nTherefore, genetic variation, mutation, and natural selection are the essential processes that lead to antibiotic resistance.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) 1, 2, 3 and 4**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes artificial selection (1). Artificial selection is a process where humans intentionally select and breed organisms for desired traits, such as breeding crops for higher yields or dogs for specific physical characteristics. The development of antibiotic resistance is an unintentional and undesirable outcome of antibiotic use. While human action (using antibiotics) creates the environment for selection, the selection process itself is natural\u2014based on survival\u2014not a deliberate human choice to create resistant bacteria.\n\n**B) 1, 2 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes artificial selection (1), which is not the correct mechanism, and it excludes natural selection (4). Natural selection is the critical driving force that explains *how* the resistance trait becomes common in the population. Without the selective pressure of the antibiotic killing susceptible bacteria and allowing resistant ones to thrive (natural selection), the resistance mutation would remain rare and would not lead to a resistant strain.\n\n**D) 2 and 4 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it omits mutation (3). While natural selection acts upon existing genetic variation, mutation is the ultimate source of new traits, including antibiotic resistance. Without a random mutation occurring to create the resistance allele in the first place, there would be no advantageous trait for natural selection to favour.

This transfer of genetic material between different plants is known as cross-pollination. In flowering plants, pollination involves the transfer of pollen, which contains the male gametes, from the anther (the male part of the flower) to the stigma (the receptive female part of the flower). For the sweet pepper plant to produce seeds that carry the trait for \"hotness,\" its flowers must have been pollinated by pollen from a hot pepper plant. Therefore, pollen was transferred from the anther of a hot pepper plant to the stigma of a sweet pepper plant. Following this pollination, fertilization would result in seeds containing a combination of genes from both parent plants.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Self-pollination has occurred and pollen has been transferred from the anther of a hot pepper plant to the stigma of a sweet pepper plant.**\nThis statement is contradictory. Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. The transfer of pollen from a hot pepper plant to a sweet pepper plant is, by definition, cross-pollination. Since new genetic material (for the 'hot' trait) was introduced to the sweet pepper plant's offspring, self-pollination could not have been the sole process.\n\n**B: Cross-pollination has occurred and pollen has been transferred from the stigma of a hot pepper plant to the anther of a sweet pepper plant.**\nWhile this option correctly identifies the process as cross-pollination, it incorrectly describes the mechanism of pollen transfer. The anther is the part of the stamen (male reproductive organ) that produces and releases pollen. The stigma is the receptive tip of the carpel (female reproductive organ) that receives pollen. Pollen is transferred *from* an anther *to* a stigma, not the other way around. This statement describes a biologically impossible direction of transfer.\n\n**C: Self-pollination has occurred and pollen has been transferred from the stigma of a hot pepper plant to the anther of a sweet pepper plant.**\nThis statement contains two major errors. Firstly, it incorrectly identifies the process as self-pollination when the mixing of traits clearly indicates cross-pollination. Secondly, it describes an incorrect direction of pollen transfer.

Although nearly all cells in a human body contain the same complete set of genes (the genome), they produce different proteins because of **differential gene expression**. This means that in any given cell type, only a specific subset of genes is \"switched on\" or expressed. These expressed genes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into proteins that determine the cell's unique characteristics and functions. For example, a pancreatic cell expresses the gene for insulin, while a muscle cell expresses the genes for actin and myosin. Both cells possess the genes for all these proteins, but only the relevant genes are activated.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Alleles can be dominant or recessive.**\nThis statement describes a principle of heredity, not cell differentiation. Alleles are different versions of the same gene. Dominance and recessiveness explain how these different versions interact to produce an organism's traits. However, this does not explain why different cells within that same organism produce different proteins. All somatic cells in an individual have the same alleles; the difference between cells arises from which genes are expressed, not the nature of their alleles.\n\n**C. Cells have different genes.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect for most cells in the human body. With the exception of gametes (sperm and eggs) and some specialized cells like mature red blood cells (which lack a nucleus), all somatic (body) cells contain the identical set of genes. A nerve cell has the same genes as a skin cell. The variation in their function and protein production is due to the differential expression of this common set of genes, not from possessing different genes altogether.\n\n**D. The sequence of bases in the DNA varies between different cells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The DNA sequence, which is the order of nucleotide bases, is the fundamental genetic blueprint and is virtually identical in all somatic cells of an individual. Cell specialization is not achieved by altering this primary DNA sequence. Instead, it is controlled by regulatory mechanisms that determine which genes within that sequence are transcribed and translated into proteins.

The graph correctly shows a gradual increase from 4 to 8 arbitrary units, as DNA synthesis occurs over a period of time.\n*   **Pre-mitotic and Mitotic Phases (G2 and M):** After the S phase, the cell enters the G2 phase and then mitosis (M phase). Throughout G2 and the stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase), the cell contains a doubled mass of DNA (8 arbitrary units). The graph correctly shows this as a plateau.\n*   **Cytokinesis:** At the end of mitosis, the cell undergoes cytokinesis, dividing into two genetically identical daughter cells. This division halves the amount of DNA in each new cell, returning the mass of DNA per cell to the original baseline level (4 arbitrary units). The graph correctly shows this as a rapid, vertical drop. The new daughter cells are now in the G1 phase.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This graph correctly shows the initial DNA mass (4 units) doubling to 8 units during the S phase and remaining high during mitosis. However, after cell division (cytokinesis), it incorrectly shows the DNA mass per cell dropping to 2 units. In mitosis, a cell divides into two, and each daughter cell receives half of the doubled DNA, meaning the DNA mass should return to the original value of 4 units, not be quartered to 2 units. A reduction to a quarter of the duplicated amount (or half the original amount) is characteristic of meiosis II.\n\n**C:** This graph is incorrect because it shows the mass of DNA decreasing from 4 units to 1 unit. During the cell cycle leading up to mitosis, the mass of DNA must double, not decrease. A decrease in DNA content is not a feature of a healthy cell preparing for mitotic division.\n\n**D:** This graph is incorrect for several reasons. Firstly, it shows an initial decrease in DNA mass, which is not part of the normal cell cycle. Secondly, the changes in DNA mass are depicted as instantaneous vertical lines. DNA synthesis (replication) is a process that takes time and should be represented by a sloped line, as shown in graphs A and B.

This alteration can result in the formation of a new allele (an alternative form of a gene). The introduction of new alleles into a population's gene pool is the primary source of genetic variation. Genetic variation is the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population, and it is the essential raw material upon which natural selection and other evolutionary forces act. Therefore, mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A mutation is a change in the amino acid sequence of DNA.**\nThis statement is incorrect. DNA is a nucleic acid composed of a sequence of nucleotides (with bases Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine), not amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. A gene mutation is a change in the nucleotide base sequence of DNA. This change in the DNA may, in turn, cause a change in the sequence of amino acids in the protein that the gene codes for, but the mutation itself is the change in the DNA.\n\n**C. Mutations are caused by random mating.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Random mating is a pattern of reproduction in which individuals mate without any preference for particular genotypes or phenotypes. This process shuffles existing alleles within a population into new combinations in the offspring, which contributes to genetic diversity. However, it does not cause mutations, which are changes in the actual DNA sequence. Mutations are caused by errors during DNA replication or by exposure to mutagens (e.g., UV radiation, certain chemicals).\n\n**D. Mutations happen during random fertilisation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Random fertilisation refers to the chance event that a specific sperm cell from the male parent will fertilise a specific egg cell from the female parent. Like random mating, this process increases genetic variation by creating unique combinations of existing parental alleles in the zygote. It does not, however, involve or cause a change in the DNA sequence of the genes themselves.

This is the primary pathway through which nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere and enters the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, making it available for living organisms. This process is carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which can be free-living in the soil or live symbiotically in the root nodules of leguminous plants, and also by high-energy events like lightning strikes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) decomposition:** Decomposition is the process by which bacteria and fungi break down the organic matter of dead organisms and their waste products (e.g., urea). This process releases the nitrogen locked within these organic molecules back into the soil, primarily in the form of ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a). While it is a crucial step in recycling nitrogen within an ecosystem, it does not involve the removal of nitrogen gas from the atmosphere.\n\n**B) denitrification:** Denitrification is the process by which soil bacteria, known as denitrifying bacteria, convert nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b) and nitrites (NO\u2082\u207b) back into gaseous nitrogen (N\u2082). This nitrogen gas is then released into the atmosphere. Therefore, denitrification is the process that *returns* nitrogen gas to the atmosphere, not the one that removes it.\n\n**C) nitrification:** Nitrification is a two-step process carried out by different types of bacteria in the soil. First, nitrifying bacteria convert ammonium ions (NH\u2084\u207a) into nitrites (NO\u2082\u207b). Then, other nitrifying bacteria convert these nitrites into nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b).

When fertilisers are used in excess, nitrates can be washed from the farmland into the pond in a process called leaching. These nitrates are a key nutrient for algae and aquatic plants, causing them to grow and reproduce rapidly in an event known as an algal bloom (eutrophication). When these large quantities of algae die, they sink to the bottom and are broken down by decomposers (bacteria and fungi). These decomposers respire aerobically, consuming large amounts of dissolved oxygen from the water. This depletion of oxygen (hypoxia or anoxia) leads to the death of fish and other aquatic animals that require oxygen for their own respiration.\n\nBy decreasing the use of nitrate fertilisers, the farmer reduces the nutrient runoff into the pond. This prevents the algal bloom. Consequently, there is less dead organic matter, leading to a smaller population of decomposers and a significant decrease in the rate of decomposition. As less oxygen is consumed by decomposers, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water increases, allowing the pond to support a larger and more diverse population of aquatic organisms.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: There is a decrease in dissolved oxygen due to an increase in decomposition.**\nThis statement describes the negative effects of eutrophication, which leads to the death of organisms, rather than their recovery and increase. An increase in decomposition by aerobic bacteria consumes vast amounts of dissolved oxygen, causing a *decrease* in its concentration. Low levels of dissolved oxygen are harmful to most aquatic life, such as fish, and would cause a decrease, not an increase, in the number of organisms.\n\n**B: There is a decrease in dissolved oxygen due to an increase in photosynthesis.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, a decrease in dissolved oxygen would be detrimental to the pond's ecosystem and would not help increase the number of organisms. Secondly, the process of photosynthesis *produces* oxygen.

A plasmid is a small, circular loop of DNA that is separate from the main bacterial chromosome. Plasmids are essential tools in genetic modification because they can be used as vectors to carry foreign DNA into a bacterial cell. In this process, scientists can isolate the plasmid, use restriction enzymes to cut it open, and insert a desired gene (e.g., the gene for human insulin). The ends are then joined using DNA ligase, creating a recombinant plasmid. When this modified plasmid is reintroduced into a bacterium, the bacterium will replicate the plasmid along with its own DNA. The bacterial cell's machinery will then transcribe and translate the inserted gene, producing large quantities of the desired protein. The ease with which plasmids can be manipulated and their ability to replicate independently make them the key feature that renders bacteria so useful for genetic modification.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** The structure labelled A represents pili (singular: pilus). These are hair-like appendages on the surface of the bacterium primarily used for attachment to surfaces and for transferring genetic material to other bacteria during a process called conjugation. While conjugation is a form of natural gene transfer, pili themselves are not the structures that scientists typically manipulate and use as vectors in laboratory-based genetic modification procedures.\n\n*   **B:** The structure labelled B is a flagellum.

The flagellum is involved in locomotion and has no direct role in the uptake, replication, or expression of foreign genes during genetic modification.\n\n*   **D:** The structure labelled D is the main bacterial chromosome, located in a region called the nucleoid. It contains the essential genetic information required for the bacterium's survival and reproduction. While it is the primary source of genetic material, it is not typically used as a vector in genetic modification because it is much larger and more complex to manipulate than a plasmid.

The goal is to break down the sugar lactose, which is naturally present in milk.\n\n*   **Identifying X:** Enzymes are highly specific, meaning each enzyme catalyses a particular reaction. The enzyme that breaks down the substrate lactose is called **lactase**. Therefore, X, the enzyme contained within the alginate beads, must be lactase.\n*   **Identifying Y:** Lactase catalyses the hydrolysis of lactose, which is a disaccharide (a complex sugar). This reaction breaks lactose down into its two simpler constituent sugars (monosaccharides): **glucose** and galactose. The milk that passes through the column will therefore be free of lactose but will contain the products of its breakdown. Consequently, Y, a substance found in the resulting milk, is glucose.\n\nThis process is used commercially to produce milk for individuals who are lactose intolerant, meaning they cannot produce sufficient lactase to digest lactose themselves.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: amylase, glucose**\nAmylase is an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of starch into simpler sugars like glucose. Milk's primary carbohydrate is lactose, not starch. Therefore, amylase would not be effective in this process, making it an incorrect choice for X.\n\n**B: amylase, starch**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as mentioned, amylase is the incorrect enzyme because milk does not contain significant amounts of starch. Secondly, amylase breaks down starch; it does not produce it. Therefore, starch cannot be the product (Y) of an enzymatic reaction involving amylase.\n\n**D: lactase, starch**\nWhile lactase is the correct enzyme (X) to break down lactose, the product of this reaction is not starch. Lactase breaks the disaccharide lactose down into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose.

Metabolism refers to the sum of all chemical reactions occurring within a living organism, such as respiration and the breakdown of proteins. These reactions produce waste products, including carbon dioxide and urea, which can be harmful if they accumulate. The removal of these specific waste products is defined as excretion and is essential for maintaining a stable internal environment (homeostasis).\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** This statement describes cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose and other nutrients to release energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). While the waste products of respiration (like carbon dioxide) are removed by the process of excretion, the energy-releasing reaction itself is respiration, not excretion.\n\n**B:** This statement describes growth. Growth is a fundamental characteristic of life defined as a permanent increase in an organism's size and dry mass, resulting from an increase in cell number, cell size, or both.

The plant cell shown possesses a cell wall, nucleus, cytoplasm, and a large central vacuole, but it conspicuously lacks chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis, a process that requires light. Root cells are typically located underground, where there is no light. Consequently, they do not perform photosynthesis and do not contain chloroplasts.

The result is a unitless value that indicates how many times larger the image is compared to the object. For example, if a cell's actual size is 10 \u00b5m and its image in a drawing is 50,000 \u00b5m (or 5 cm), the magnification is 50,000 \u00b5m / 10 \u00b5m = 5000.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. `actual size / image size`**\nThis formula is the reciprocal (the inverse) of the correct formula for magnification. If an image is magnified, its size will be larger than the actual size, so this calculation would result in a value less than 1. This value does not represent magnification but rather the factor by which the image would need to be scaled down to match the actual object.\n\n**B. `actual size \u00d7 image size`**\nThis formula is incorrect because magnification is a ratio, which requires division, not multiplication.

This process also utilizes specific carrier proteins embedded within the cell membrane that bind to the substance and transport it across. The diagram illustrates this process by showing a substance moving from a lower concentration outside the cell to a higher concentration inside the cytoplasm, and the question states that this process uses energy from respiration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B: Diffusion** is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration (down a concentration gradient).

In the presence of a reducing sugar, the color of Benedict's solution changes from blue through a series of colors\u2014green, yellow, orange\u2014to a final brick-red precipitate.

As catalysts, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without being consumed or permanently altered in the process. This means an enzyme molecule can be used repeatedly. The function of an enzyme is highly specific, which is determined by the unique three-dimensional shape of its active site. This active site is not identical in shape to the substrate but is instead *complementary*. This complementary relationship ensures that only the specific substrate can bind to the active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex, similar to how a key fits into a specific lock. Therefore, an enzyme is made of protein, it is not used up during the reaction, and its active site is not the same shape as the substrate.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option incorrectly states that enzymes are used up during a reaction and that they are not made of protein. Enzymes are catalysts, meaning they remain unchanged after facilitating a reaction and can be reused. Furthermore, enzymes are, by definition, proteins (with the rare exception of ribozymes, which are beyond the scope of this curriculum). Their protein structure is essential for creating the specific active site required for their function.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option presents three incorrect statements about enzymes. Firstly, it claims the active site is the same shape as the substrate, which is inaccurate; the shapes are complementary to allow for specific binding. Secondly, it incorrectly states that enzymes are used up during the reaction, contradicting their role as reusable catalysts. Thirdly, it wrongly suggests that enzymes are not made of protein, when in fact their proteinaceous nature is fundamental to their structure and function.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the active site of an enzyme is the same shape as its substrate. While the shapes are related, they are complementary, not identical. The substrate fits into the active site. This specificity is a cornerstone of enzyme function.

The rates at 15\u00b0C (96 bubbles/min) and 35\u00b0C (82 bubbles/min) are also high but lower than the peak at 25\u00b0C. Since the maximum observed activity occurs at 25\u00b0C, which lies between 15\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C, this range correctly identifies where the optimum temperature is located.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThe range between 35\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C shows a decrease in enzyme activity, from 82 bubbles per minute to 36 bubbles per minute. This decline indicates that the temperatures are above the optimum. At temperatures beyond the optimum, the enzyme begins to denature. Denaturation involves the loss of the specific three-dimensional shape of the enzyme, including its active site, which reduces its ability to catalyse the reaction. Therefore, this range represents a state of decreasing efficiency, not optimal activity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe range between 35\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C shows a significant and continuous decline in the rate of reaction, from 82 bubbles per minute down to only 1 bubble per minute. This steep drop in activity is characteristic of enzyme denaturation caused by excessive heat. The enzyme's structure is irreversibly altered at these high temperatures, rendering it almost completely inactive. The optimum temperature, which corresponds to maximum activity, must be lower than this range.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThe range between 45\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C shows the lowest levels of enzyme activity in the experiment.

Humidity refers to the concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere. In humid conditions, the air is already saturated with water vapour, which reduces the water potential gradient between the moist air spaces inside the leaf and the air outside. This smaller gradient causes water to evaporate more slowly from the leaf surfaces through the stomata. As the rate of transpiration decreases, the plant's uptake of water from the capillary tube also decreases. Consequently, the air bubble will move a shorter distance in the same amount of time. A distance of 15 mm is less than the 30 mm measured on the dry day, reflecting this reduced rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A**\nThis option provides an incorrect explanation for the observed phenomenon. In humid air, the rate of evaporation decreases, it does not increase. A high concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere reduces the water potential gradient between the leaf and the surrounding air, slowing down the diffusion of water molecules from the leaf surface. Although the predicted distance is correctly reduced, the reasoning is scientifically inaccurate.\n\n**C**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it predicts that the distance moved would increase to 45 mm. An increase in distance would signify a higher rate of transpiration. However, changing conditions from dry to humid would decrease the transpiration rate, causing the bubble to move a shorter distance, not a longer one. Secondly, the explanation that water evaporates more quickly in humid air is incorrect. High humidity slows the rate of evaporation.\n\n**D**\nWhile the explanation provided in this option is correct\u2014water does evaporate more slowly in humid air\u2014the predicted distance is incorrect. A slower rate of water uptake, resulting from reduced transpiration, would cause the air bubble to travel a shorter distance than the original 30 mm.

The correct answer is B because auxin is produced at the shoot tip (K), and the lowest concentration of auxin is found on the shaded side of the shoot (L). *Editor's note: Based on the provided answer key, there is an apparent contradiction with the standard biological model. The explanation below reconciles the answer with the diagram.*\n\nThe plant hormone auxin is responsible for controlling cell elongation. It is synthesised in the apical meristem, which is located at the very tip of the plant shoot, corresponding to region **K**. From the tip, auxin diffuses downwards, affecting the cells in the region of elongation below.\n\nWhen a shoot is exposed to unilateral light, the light causes the auxin to migrate from the illuminated side to the shaded side. In this diagram, the shoot is bending towards the light, which means the cells on the shaded side (**L**) must be elongating more rapidly than the cells on the illuminated side (**J**). In shoots, a higher concentration of auxin stimulates greater cell elongation. Therefore, the shaded side (**L**) has a higher concentration of auxin. Consequently, the side facing the light (**J**) has the lowest concentration of auxin.\n\nBased on this established biological principle, the correct combination should be production at **K** and the lowest concentration at **J**. However, let's re-examine the options. Option B states production is at **K** and the lowest concentration is at **L**. This suggests an error in the question's premise or options. If we strictly follow the provided answer as B, it would imply that the shaded side (L) has the lowest auxin concentration, which contradicts the known mechanism of positive phototropism where high auxin levels on the shaded side promote growth.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, assuming there is a mistake in the question and that option **A (K, J)** was the intended correct answer would align with scientific principles. Auxin is produced at **K**, and light causes it to move to the shaded side **L**, leaving the illuminated side **J** with the lowest concentration.\n\nHowever, if we must justify **B**, it's impossible to do so with the standard understanding of phototropism. Let us proceed by explaining the correct biology, which points to **A** as the correct choice and highlights the inconsistencies in the other options based on this correct model.\n\n**Explanation of Why the Correct Answer *Should Be* A (K, J):**\n\n*   **Where auxin is produced:** Auxin is a plant hormone primarily produced in the apical meristem at the tip of the shoot. This corresponds to region **K**.\n*   **Which side has the lowest concentration:** The diagram shows the shoot bending towards the light. This positive phototropism is caused by a differential distribution of auxin. Light causes auxin to move to the shaded side of the shoot (**L**). This leads to a higher concentration of auxin on the shaded side (**L**), which promotes more rapid cell elongation. Consequently, the side directly illuminated by light (**J**) has a depleted, or lower, concentration of auxin. Therefore, side **J** has the lowest auxin concentration.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Options based on Correct Biological Principles:**\n\n*   **Option A:** States that auxin is produced at **K** (correct) and the lowest concentration is at **J** (correct). This aligns perfectly with the mechanism of positive phototropism.\n\n*   **Option B:** States that auxin is produced at **K** (correct) but that the lowest concentration is at **L** (incorrect). Side L is the shaded side, which accumulates a *higher* concentration of auxin to drive the faster growth that causes the bend.\n\n*   **Option C:** States that auxin is produced at **M** (incorrect). **M** is a region of the stem below the zone of bending and elongation; auxin is produced at the apex (**K**).

Bacteria can evolve through natural selection to become resistant to antibiotics. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics (for example, to treat non-bacterial infections or not completing a prescribed course) create a selective pressure that kills susceptible bacteria but allows resistant strains to survive, multiply, and spread. This leads to the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, or \"superbugs,\" which cause infections that are extremely difficult to treat. Therefore, to slow down the development of resistance and preserve the effectiveness of these crucial medicines, antibiotics must be used prudently and only when essential for treating a confirmed bacterial infection.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: Antibiotics are produced by memory cells.**\nThis statement is incorrect as it confuses antibiotics with antibodies. Antibiotics are chemical substances, often derived from fungi or bacteria, that are used as drugs to kill or inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Memory cells are a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) involved in the adaptive immune response. When activated, B-memory cells can differentiate into plasma cells, which produce **antibodies**. Antibodies are proteins that specifically target pathogens for destruction by the immune system. The body does not produce antibiotics.\n\n**B: Antibiotics are used to treat rickets.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibiotics are specifically designed to treat infections caused by bacteria. Rickets is not an infectious disease; it is a condition affecting bone development in children. It is caused by a nutritional deficiency, most commonly a lack of vitamin D or calcium. Since rickets is not caused by a bacterial pathogen, antibiotics would have no effect on its treatment. The treatment for rickets involves supplementation with vitamin D and calcium.\n\n**C: Antibiotics are used to treat viral infections.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria. They work by targeting specific structures or metabolic pathways found in bacterial cells, such as the cell wall or bacterial ribosomes.

This method of reproduction is a form of asexual reproduction known as vegetative propagation. In this process, a new individual arises from the vegetative parts of a single parent plant. The resulting offspring, the plantlet at D, is genetically identical to the parent plant. This entire structure\u2014a runner giving rise to a new rooted plantlet\u2014is exclusively a mechanism of asexual reproduction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe structure labelled A is a flower. Flowers are the reproductive organs of a plant for sexual reproduction. They contain the male parts (stamens) that produce pollen and the female parts (carpels) that contain ovules. The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) occurs within the flower, leading to the formation of seeds. Therefore, the flower is fundamentally associated with sexual, not asexual, reproduction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThe structure labelled B is the fruit (a strawberry). In flowering plants, the fruit develops from the flower after successful pollination and fertilisation, which are key events in sexual reproduction. The fruit's primary function is to protect the seeds and aid in their dispersal. The seeds contained within (or on the surface of, in the case of a strawberry) are the products of sexual reproduction and can grow into new, genetically distinct individuals.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe structures labelled C are the leaves of the parent plant. Leaves are vegetative organs primarily responsible for photosynthesis. While the parent plant itself could have been produced through asexual reproduction (as a plantlet from a previous runner), it could also have grown from a seed, which is the result of sexual reproduction. Therefore, the presence of leaves on a mature plant is not an indicator that it was produced solely by asexual means.

After pollination, when a pollen grain lands on the receptive stigma, it germinates and grows a pollen tube. This tube extends down through the tissue of the style, creating a pathway for the male gametes to travel from the stigma to an ovule located within the ovary, where fertilisation occurs. Therefore, the style is the structure that contains the pollen tube.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) anther:**\nThe anther is part of the stamen, the male reproductive organ of a flower. Its function is to produce and contain pollen grains before they are released for pollination. The pollen tube only develops from a pollen grain *after* it has landed on the stigma of a compatible flower. Consequently, the anther itself does not contain a pollen tube.\n\n**B) filament:**\nThe filament is the stalk that supports the anther, making up the other part of the stamen. Its primary role is to position the anther appropriately for effective pollen dispersal. It is not involved in the process of pollen germination or the growth of the pollen tube.\n\n**C) stamen:**\nThe stamen is the complete male reproductive organ of a flower, consisting of the anther and the filament. The function of the stamen is to produce and present pollen.

Germination is a complex metabolic process that relies on enzyme-catalysed reactions. The rate of these reactions is highly dependent on temperature. By storing seeds at very low temperatures (typically -20\u00b0C), the kinetic energy of the enzyme and substrate molecules is significantly reduced. This drastically slows down the rate of all metabolic processes, including respiration, which provides the energy for growth. Consequently, the embryo remains dormant, and germination is effectively inhibited, allowing the seeds to remain viable for extended periods.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: high humidity**\nHigh humidity would promote, not prevent, seed germination. Water is a primary requirement for germination to begin. The process starts with imbibition, where the seed absorbs water from its surroundings. This rehydrates the seed's tissues and activates dormant enzymes that break down stored food reserves. High humidity provides the necessary moisture for imbibition to occur, thus triggering the germination process. For long-term storage, seeds are actually dried to a very low moisture content to prevent this.\n\n**B: high oxygen levels**\nHigh oxygen levels would facilitate, not prevent, seed germination. Once a seed has absorbed water, it requires oxygen to carry out aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration breaks down the food stores within the seed to release a large amount of energy in the form of ATP. This energy is essential to fuel the growth and development of the embryonic root and shoot. Therefore, a high concentration of oxygen would support the metabolic activity required for germination.\n\n**C: low light intensity**\nLow light intensity is not a reliable method for preventing germination across all plant species. While some seeds require light to germinate (they are 'photoblastic'), many others germinate in the absence of light, as they would naturally be buried in soil. For these species, darkness or low light is a neutral or even favourable condition for germination. Since a seed bank aims to preserve a wide variety of species with different germination requirements, controlling light is not a universally effective strategy for inducing dormancy."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_546.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "26 the graph shows the changes to the thickness of the lining of the uterus during the menstrual\ncycle.\neee elle eee ee eee eee ee eee eel eeeeffll ecfa\na suse sees seeesesteeeeeesgeseesegse\"27 7 20e=eef 775 =eee7eeeseeeteeeeett\nppreeeeeeeeeeeee eee ee eee eere eee eee eee eee eee eee\n\u2014 beer ceeteobegeteuoeseuou0s0h? 00 eete000 c0000 0ce 0000 0cs0 00000200008\nickness a\nof the lining eeceeere eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee\neee ere eea eee eee eh\nof thestiterus: ecseec ponce eee ces eec ere rere ese\neeeeeeene ee eee eee eeeeee eee eee eee eeeeeeeceece eee eh\neeeeeeeeereeeeeeee ce eee eee eee eee eee eeeehh\nss ee\nh+ 4-5} ft\neee ee eae eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eere\neeeeeee reece ee eee eee ee eee ee eee eee eee eee eee eee ee eee eee eee\neee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee]\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\nday of the menstrual cycle\nwhich hormone is responsible for the change to the thickness of the lining of the uterus shown\nbetween days 5 and 16?\na fsh\nb lh\nc_ oestrogen\nd progesterone", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nOestrogen is the hormone responsible for the repair and proliferation of the uterine lining following menstruation. It is secreted by the developing follicles within the ovary during the first half of the menstrual cycle (the follicular phase). Oestrogen stimulates the cells of the endometrium (the uterine lining) to multiply, causing it to thicken and develop a rich network of blood vessels. This process begins after menstruation ceases (around day 5) and continues until ovulation (around day 14), preparing the uterus for potential implantation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone):** FSH is secreted by the pituitary gland and its primary role is to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries. While the developing follicles produce oestrogen, FSH itself does not have a direct effect on the thickness of the uterine lining. Its influence is indirect, through the stimulation of oestrogen secretion.\n\n**B. LH (Luteinising Hormone):** LH is also secreted by the pituitary gland. A sharp surge in LH levels around day 14 of the cycle triggers ovulation\u2014the release of a mature egg from the ovary. LH also stimulates the remnant of the follicle to develop into the corpus luteum after ovulation. It does not directly cause the initial thickening of the uterine lining.\n\n**D. Progesterone:** Progesterone is primarily secreted by the corpus luteum in the ovary *after* ovulation, during the second half of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase). Its main function is to maintain the thickened uterine lining, further increasing its blood supply and causing it to secrete nutrients in preparation for the implantation of a fertilised egg.

Progesterone is essential for maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium), preventing menstruation, and suppressing uterine contractions. Oestrogen works with progesterone to maintain the endometrium and also stimulates the growth of the uterus and mammary glands. Both hormones are initially produced by the corpus luteum and later in much larger quantities by the placenta. The high levels of oestrogen and progesterone exert a negative feedback effect on the pituitary gland, inhibiting the secretion of both Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and LH. This suppression of LH prevents further ovulation from occurring during the pregnancy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it states that oestrogen concentrations are low during pregnancy. In fact, oestrogen levels are high and rise throughout pregnancy. Oestrogen is vital for supporting the developing fetus, stimulating the growth of the uterus to accommodate the fetus, and preparing the mammary glands for lactation.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that LH concentrations are high, while oestrogen and progesterone concentrations are low. During pregnancy, high levels of progesterone and oestrogen are required to maintain the uterine lining. These high levels, in turn, inhibit the release of LH from the pituitary gland, meaning LH concentrations are actually very low.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it states that LH concentrations are high and progesterone concentrations are low.

The gene responsible is located on the X chromosome. Let's denote the dominant allele for normal colour vision as X^C and the recessive allele for colour blindness as X^c.\n\n*   The female parent is heterozygous, so her genotype is X^C X^c. She has normal vision but is a carrier for the colour-blindness allele. Her gametes (eggs) will have a 50% chance of carrying the X^C allele and a 50% chance of carrying the X^c allele.\n*   The male parent is red-green colour-blind. Since males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), his genotype must be X^c Y. To produce a female child, he must contribute his X chromosome. Therefore, all his female children will inherit the X^c allele from him.\n\nTo determine the chance of their female child being colour-blind, we consider the possible combinations of alleles she can inherit:\n1.  She inherits X^C from her mother and X^c from her father. Her genotype will be X^C X^c, and she will have normal vision (but be a carrier).\n2.  She inherits X^c from her mother and X^c from her father. Her genotype will be X^c X^c, and she will be colour-blind.\n\nSince there is a 50% chance the mother contributes the X^C allele and a 50% chance she contributes the X^c allele, there are two equally likely outcomes for a female child.

A Punnett square of this cross shows four possible offspring: a carrier female (X^C X^c), a colour-blind female (X^c X^c), a normal-vision male (X^C Y), and a colour-blind male (X^c Y). Each has a 25% chance. However, the question specifically asks for the probability for a *female child*, which means we only consider the two possible female outcomes. Of these two, one results in colour blindness, making the probability 1/2 or 50%.\n\n**D) 100%:** This is incorrect. For a female child to have a 100% chance of being colour-blind, she would need to inherit the X^c allele from her mother with certainty.

Therefore, having deep roots is a feature of a xerophyte.\n*   **Leaves with small surface area:** Water is primarily lost from a plant through transpiration from the leaf surfaces. By having leaves with a small surface area (or leaves modified into spines or needles), the plant significantly reduces the area exposed to the sun and wind, thereby decreasing the rate of water loss.\n*   **Few stomata on leaves:** Stomata are pores through which water vapour escapes during transpiration. To conserve water, xerophytes have a reduced number of stomata. Therefore, the statement 'many stomata' is incorrect for a xerophyte.\n*   **Thick leaf cuticle:** The cuticle is a waxy, waterproof layer covering the leaf epidermis.

Plants adapted to dry conditions must minimise water loss. Large leaves and many stomata would both dramatically increase the rate of transpiration, leading to rapid dehydration and death in an arid environment. A key xerophytic adaptation is having a reduced leaf surface area and a low density of stomata to conserve water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly states that xerophytes do not have deep roots and that they have a thin leaf cuticle. Deep root systems are a vital adaptation for reaching underground water sources in dry habitats. A thin cuticle would offer very little protection against water loss from the leaf surface, which would be detrimental to a plant in a water-scarce environment. Xerophytes are characterised by having thick, waxy cuticles to minimise such water loss.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect on all four features. It describes a plant that lacks deep roots, has large leaves, many stomata, and a thin cuticle.

In a food web, an organism can occupy multiple trophic levels depending on its diet.\n\n**D: tertiary consumer only**\nThis is an incomplete description. While the cod acts as a tertiary consumer when it consumes shrimp, this overlooks its other food source. The cod also consumes zooplankton, which are primary consumers. By eating zooplankton, the cod is also functioning as a secondary consumer.

During photosynthesis, plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the atmosphere and water (H\u2082O) into glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), which is a form of chemical energy, and oxygen (O\u2082), which is released as a byproduct. Arrow B in the diagram illustrates the uptake of carbon from the air by plants, which is the key input of carbon for photosynthesis. Therefore, arrow B correctly represents the process described by the given chemical equation.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** Arrow A represents the process of combustion. This is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases stored carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The general equation for combustion involves a fuel reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water (e.g., CH\u2084 + 2O\u2082 \u2192 CO\u2082 + 2H\u2082O). This is fundamentally different from the given equation, which consumes carbon dioxide to produce glucose.\n\n**C:** Arrow C represents cellular respiration in plants. During respiration, plants break down glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) using oxygen (O\u2082) to release energy for metabolic processes. This process releases carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) back into the atmosphere. The equation for respiration is the reverse of photosynthesis: `C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 \u2192 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O`. The arrow of reaction is in the opposite direction to the one given in the question.\n\n**D:** Arrow D represents consumption or feeding. This is the transfer of carbon in the form of organic compounds (such as glucose, starch, and cellulose) from plants to animals when the animals eat the plants. This is a step in the food chain representing the transfer of matter and energy, not a chemical reaction that converts inorganic carbon dioxide into organic molecules. The equation provided describes the initial production of these organic molecules within the plant, not their subsequent transfer to an animal."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_556.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "36 which statement explains why there is a lag phase in a population graph?\na the build-up of waste products limits population growth.\nb_ the low population size limits the birth rate.\nc_ the number of births is equal to the number of deaths.\nd the number of deaths is greater than the number of births.", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation\n\n**B. The low population size limits the birth rate.**\n\nThe lag phase is the initial period in a population growth curve where the rate of increase is very slow. This is primarily because the initial population size is small. With only a few individuals present, the total number of offspring produced (the overall birth rate) is low, even if the individual organisms are reproducing at a high rate. For population growth to become rapid (as seen in the subsequent exponential or log phase), there needs to be a substantial number of individuals to reproduce. In addition to the small population size, organisms may also be acclimatising to their new environment during the lag phase, for example by synthesising specific enzymes needed to digest available nutrients, which can also contribute to the initial slow growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The build-up of waste products limits population growth.**\n\nThe accumulation of toxic waste products is a density-dependent limiting factor. This means it becomes significant only when the population density is high. During the lag phase, the population is small and density is low, so waste products have not yet accumulated to levels that would inhibit growth. The build-up of waste products is a primary reason for the slowing of growth in the stationary phase and the subsequent decline in the death phase.\n\n**C. The number of births is equal to the number of deaths.**\n\nA situation where the birth rate equals the death rate results in zero population growth. This defines the stationary phase of the population growth curve, where the population size remains constant because it has reached the carrying capacity (K) of the environment. In contrast, the lag phase is a period of slow but positive growth, meaning the birth rate is slightly higher than the death rate, but the overall increase is minimal due to the small number of reproducing individuals.\n\n**D. The number of deaths is greater than the number of births.**\n\nWhen the number of deaths exceeds the number of births, the population size decreases. This describes the death or decline phase of the growth curve, which occurs after the stationary phase. This decline is typically caused by severe environmental limitations, such as the complete depletion of essential resources and a high concentration of toxic waste products. The lag phase, however, is the very first stage of population *increase*."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_557.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "37 the flow chart describes the process of eutrophication.\nstep x\nincreased growth of producers\nincreased decomposition after death of producers\nstep y\ndeath of organisms in water\nwhat should be at step x and step y in the flow chart?\nee ee\na decrease in nitrate decreased dissolved\nion concentration oxygen concentration\nb increase in nitrate decreased dissolved\nion concentration oxygen concentration\ncc decrease in nitrate increased dissolved\nion concentration oxygen concentration\nd increase in nitrate increased dissolved\nion concentration oxygen concentration", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe process of eutrophication begins with the enrichment of a body of water with mineral nutrients. **Step X** represents this initial event, which is an **increase in nitrate ion concentration** (and often phosphate ions) due to runoff from agricultural land (fertilizers) or from sewage effluent. These nitrates act as a fertilizer for aquatic producers like algae.\n\nThe increased availability of nitrates leads to a rapid and excessive growth of these producers, known as an algal bloom. When these producers die, their decomposition by a large population of aerobic bacteria consumes vast amounts of dissolved oxygen from the water through respiration. This leads to **Step Y**, a **decreased dissolved oxygen concentration**. The severe depletion of oxygen (hypoxia or anoxia) then causes the death of other aerobic aquatic organisms, such as fish and invertebrates, which are unable to respire.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Step X is incorrect. Eutrophication is caused by an *increase* in the concentration of nutrient ions like nitrates, not a decrease. A decrease in nitrates would limit the growth of producers and prevent eutrophication. Although Step Y is correctly identified as a decrease in dissolved oxygen, the initial trigger in Step X is wrong.\n\n**C:** Both Step X and Step Y are incorrect. Step X is incorrect because eutrophication is initiated by an *increase*, not a decrease, in nitrate concentration. Step Y is incorrect because the process of decomposition by aerobic bacteria consumes dissolved oxygen, leading to a *decrease* in its concentration, not an increase. An increase in dissolved oxygen would support aquatic life, not lead to widespread death.\n\n**D:** Step X is correctly identified, as an increase in nitrate ions is the trigger for eutrophication. However, Step Y is incorrect. The decomposition of dead producers is carried out by aerobic bacteria that consume dissolved oxygen for respiration. This leads to a significant *decrease*, not an increase, in the dissolved oxygen concentration, which is the direct cause of death for other aquatic organisms."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_558.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "38 how can fish stocks be conserved?\na_ closed seasons\nb_ decreased mesh size\nc_ increased quotas\nd_ reduction in protected areas", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "***\n### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nImplementing closed seasons is a key strategy for the conservation of fish stocks. A closed season is a specific period during the year when fishing for certain species is legally prohibited. This period is typically aligned with the breeding season of the fish. By ceasing fishing activities during this critical time, adult fish are able to spawn without disturbance, and their eggs and young have a chance to develop. This allows the fish population to replenish itself naturally, ensuring that there are enough young fish to grow to maturity and maintain the stock for future years. This practice is essential for preventing overexploitation and ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries.\n\n***\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. decreased mesh size:**\nDecreasing the mesh size of fishing nets would be detrimental to fish conservation. The mesh size determines the size of the fish caught; smaller holes (decreased mesh size) trap smaller, younger fish. These juvenile fish have not yet reached reproductive age. Removing them from the population prevents them from breeding and contributing to the next generation, leading to a rapid decline in the overall fish stock. Conservation regulations typically mandate a minimum or *increased* mesh size to allow young fish to escape, grow to maturity, and reproduce.\n\n**C. increased quotas:**\nA fishing quota is a legal limit on the total quantity of a specific fish species that can be caught and landed by fishing fleets. To conserve a fish stock, particularly one that is being overfished, quotas would need to be *decreased* to reduce fishing pressure and allow the population to recover. Increasing quotas would permit a higher catch, leading to accelerated depletion of the fish stock and potentially causing its collapse. Therefore, increasing quotas is the opposite of a conservation measure.\n\n**D. reduction in protected areas:**\nProtected marine areas, or no-take zones, are designated regions of the ocean where fishing and other extractive activities are strictly prohibited. These areas act as sanctuaries, allowing fish populations to live and reproduce without pressure from fishing. This leads to an increase in the size and abundance of fish within the protected zone, which can then \"spill over\" and replenish fish stocks in surrounding, non-protected fishing grounds. A reduction in the size or number of these protected areas would eliminate these vital refuges, increase the overall area subjected to fishing pressure, and undermine conservation efforts."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p2_559.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_23.pdf", "questionText": "39 penicillin is produced in a fermenter by growing the fungus penicillium. the graph shows how the\nmass of living penicillium fungus and the concentration of penicillin change over time.\nconcentration _!\nmass of living :\npenicillium mass concentration\nfungus of penicillin\n0 1 2 3 4 5\ntime /days\nwhen is the best time to collect the penicillin?\na at 1.5 days\nbat 3.0 days\nc at3.5 days\ndat 5.0 days", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 2, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe objective is to collect the maximum amount of penicillin. The graph displays two curves: the mass of the *Penicillium* fungus (solid line) and the concentration of penicillin (dashed line). To determine the best time for collection, one must identify the point where the concentration of penicillin is at its maximum.\n\nFollowing the dashed line, the concentration of penicillin begins to increase significantly after day 2.5 and continues to rise, reaching its highest point on the graph at day 5.0. At this time, the curve begins to plateau, indicating that the rate of production is slowing down and the concentration is at or near its peak. Therefore, harvesting the penicillin at 5.0 days ensures the highest possible yield. It is also noteworthy that penicillin is a secondary metabolite, meaning its production largely occurs after the primary growth phase of the fungus. The graph illustrates this, showing that the penicillin concentration peaks during the decline phase of the fungal mass.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: at 1.5 days**\nAt 1.5 days, the fungus is in its exponential growth phase, where its mass is increasing rapidly. However, the dashed line representing penicillin concentration is at zero or near-zero at this point. This indicates that significant penicillin production has not yet started. Collecting at this time would result in a negligible yield of penicillin.\n\n**B: at 3.0 days**\nAt 3.0 days, the fungal mass has reached its peak and is in the stationary phase. Penicillin production has commenced, and its concentration is rising. However, the concentration is still far below its maximum potential. Harvesting at this point would be inefficient as much more penicillin will be produced in the subsequent days.\n\n**C: at 3.5 days**\nAt 3.5 days, the fungal mass is beginning to decline, and the concentration of penicillin is increasing steeply. While the concentration is higher than at 3.0 days, the curve is still rising sharply, indicating that the peak concentration has not yet been reached.

This is done using **restriction enzymes**. These enzymes act as \"molecular scissors,\" recognizing and cutting DNA at specific base sequences. It is crucial to use the same restriction enzyme for both the human DNA and the plasmid to ensure that the resulting DNA fragments have complementary \"sticky ends,\" which allows the gene to be inserted into the plasmid. Therefore, restriction enzymes are required to isolate the human gene and to cut the bacterial plasmid.\n\n2.  **Forming a Recombinant Plasmid:** Once the human gene has been inserted into the cut plasmid, the fragments need to be permanently joined.
