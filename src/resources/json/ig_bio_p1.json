When substances like water or mineral salts are consumed in quantities greater than needed, the excess is removed. For example, the kidneys filter the blood and remove excess water and salts, which are then excreted in urine. Therefore, this category is correctly included in the definition of excretion.\n2.  **Waste products of metabolism:** These are the primary substances removed by excretion. They are by-products of chemical reactions within the body's cells. Key examples include urea, produced in the liver from the breakdown of excess amino acids, and carbon dioxide, produced during cellular respiration. If these substances were allowed to accumulate, they would become toxic.\n3.  **Undigested food:** This material is not removed by excretion. Undigested food consists of components that were never absorbed from the digestive tract into the bloodstream or body cells. Its elimination from the body is a separate process called egestion (or defecation).\n\nRow C correctly identifies that excretion involves the removal of substances in excess of requirements and the waste products of metabolism, but not undigested food.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it includes 'undigested food' as a substance removed by excretion. The removal of undigested food, which has not been absorbed by the body, is termed egestion, not excretion. Excretion specifically refers to the removal of substances that have participated in the body's metabolic processes or are present in excess within the body fluids.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it incorrectly includes 'undigested food' as a substance removed by excretion (this process is egestion). Secondly, it incorrectly excludes 'waste products of metabolism'. The removal of metabolic waste is the fundamental definition of excretion, making its exclusion a significant error.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it incorrectly excludes 'substances in excess of requirements'. A key function of excretory organs, such as the kidneys, is osmoregulation, which involves removing excess water and salts to maintain stable concentrations in the blood. Secondly, it incorrectly includes 'undigested food', which is eliminated via egestion, not excretion."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_2.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 which two parts are included in the scientific name of an organism?\na genus and group\nbs genus and species\nc group and kingdom\nd_ kingdom and species", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B (genus and species)**\n\nThe universally accepted system for naming organisms is called binomial nomenclature. This system, established by Carl Linnaeus, assigns a unique two-part scientific name to every species. The first part of the name identifies the **genus** to which the organism belongs and is always capitalized. The second part identifies the **species** within that genus and is written in lowercase. For example, the scientific name for a lion is *Panthera leo*, where *Panthera* is the genus and *leo* is the species.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: genus and group**\nWhile the genus is the first part of a scientific name, \"group\" is not a formal rank in the Linnaean system of classification. The taxonomic hierarchy consists of specific levels (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). \"Group\" is a general term and not the specific second part of the binomial name.\n\n**C: group and kingdom**\nNeither \"group\" nor \"kingdom\" is part of the two-part scientific name. The kingdom is the highest and most inclusive taxonomic rank (e.g., Animalia, Plantae), but it is not included in the specific name given to a species. \"Group\" is not a formal taxonomic term in this context.\n\n**D: kingdom and species**\nAlthough species is the correct second part of a scientific name, the kingdom is not the first part. The kingdom is a very broad classification that includes many different genera and species. The scientific name is designed to be much more specific, using the genus as the first part to indicate a close relationship with other species in that same genus."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_3.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "3 how many jointed legs does an insect have?\na two pairs\nb three pairs\nc four pairs\nd_ more than six pairs", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nInsects are a class of invertebrates within the phylum Arthropoda. A defining characteristic of all insects is the presence of three pairs of jointed legs, for a total of six legs. These legs are always attached to the thorax, which is the middle of the three distinct body segments (head, thorax, and abdomen). This six-legged body plan is a fundamental feature used to classify organisms as insects.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. two pairs**\nHaving two pairs of legs (four legs in total) is not a characteristic feature of insects or any other major class within the phylum Arthropoda. Organisms are classified based on distinct, consistent anatomical features, and three pairs of legs is the standard for the class Insecta.\n\n**C. four pairs**\nFour pairs of jointed legs (eight legs in total) is the defining characteristic of a different class of arthropods, the Arachnida. This class includes spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks. Arachnids are distinguished from insects by having eight legs and typically two main body segments (a cephalothorax and an abdomen), whereas insects have six legs and three body segments.\n\n**D. more than six pairs**\nArthropods with more than six pairs of legs belong to the subphylum Myriapoda. This group includes centipedes (class Chilopoda), which have one pair of legs per body segment, and millipedes (class Diplopoda), which have two pairs of legs per body segment. Both have numerous body segments, resulting in a large number of legs, which distinguishes them from the six-legged insects."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_4.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 the photomicrograph shows a cell from a type of aquatic plant.\nss)\n\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4\n: cs st a\nr q p\nwhich labelled parts indicate that this is a plant cell?\na pandr b pands c qandr d qandss", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct option is **D**.\n\n**Structure Q** is the cell wall, a rigid outer layer made primarily of cellulose. The presence of a cell wall is a key characteristic of plant cells; it provides structural support and maintains a fixed, regular shape. Animal cells do not have a cell wall.\n\n**Structure S** is the large central vacuole, a membrane-bound sac that occupies a significant portion of the mature plant cell's volume. It contains cell sap and is crucial for maintaining turgor pressure against the cell wall, which supports the plant. While some animal cells may have small, temporary vacuoles, they lack a large, permanent central vacuole.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both the cell wall (Q) and the large central vacuole (S) are definitive indicators that the cell is a plant cell.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: P and R**\nThis option is incorrect. **Structure P** is the nucleus, which contains the cell's genetic material. **Structure R** is the cell membrane, which controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell. Both the nucleus and the cell membrane are found in animal cells as well as plant cells. Consequently, their presence does not specifically identify the cell as being from a plant.\n\n**B: P and S**\nThis option is incorrect. While the large central vacuole (**S**) is a characteristic feature of plant cells, the nucleus (**P**) is not a distinguishing feature. The nucleus is a fundamental organelle present in almost all eukaryotic cells, including those of animals. Therefore, the nucleus does not help differentiate a plant cell from an animal cell.\n\n**C: Q and R**\nThis option is incorrect. Although the cell wall (**Q**) is a key feature of a plant cell, the cell membrane (**R**) is not. The cell membrane is present in all animal cells, located as the outer boundary. In plant cells, it is found just inside the cell wall. Because the cell membrane is common to both cell types, it is not a distinguishing feature."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_5.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 the diagram shows a magnified image of a cell. the magnification is x360. line lm represents\nthe width of the image of the cell. line lm is 18mm long in this diagram.\n:\nwhat is the actual width of the cell?\na 0.005mm b 0.05mm c 0.5mm d 5.0mm", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe actual size of an object viewed under a microscope can be calculated using the formula that relates magnification, image size, and actual size. The formula is:\n\nMagnification = Image Size / Actual Size\n\nTo find the actual width of the cell, this formula can be rearranged to:\n\nActual Size = Image Size / Magnification\n\nFrom the information provided, the image size (the length of the line LM) is 18 mm, and the magnification is x360. By substituting these values into the rearranged formula:\n\nActual Size = 18 mm / 360\n\nThis calculation results in an actual size of 0.05 mm.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. 0.005 mm**\nThis value is incorrect and likely arises from a calculation error. For the actual size to be 0.005 mm with a magnification of x360, the image size would need to be 1.8 mm (since 0.005 mm \u00d7 360 = 1.8 mm). Alternatively, if the image size were 18 mm, the magnification would have to be x3600 (since 18 mm / 0.005 mm = 3600). Neither of these scenarios matches the data given in the question.\n\n**C. 0.5 mm**\nThis answer results from a place-value error during calculation. If one were to divide the image size (18 mm) by 36 instead of the correct magnification of 360, the result would be 0.5 mm. This error overlooks the full magnitude of the magnification provided.\n\n**D. 5.0 mm**\nThis value is incorrect. An actual cell width of 5.0 mm is macroscopic and not typical for a single cell. If a cell with an actual width of 5.0 mm were magnified by x360, the resulting image size would be 1800 mm (since 5.0 mm \u00d7 360 = 1800 mm). This is 100 times larger than the 18 mm image size stated in the problem, indicating a significant calculation error."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_6.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "6 which factor would decrease the rate of diffusion of oxygen into cells?\na __ increasing concentration gradient\nb increasing surface area\nc increasing temperature\nd increasing thickness of cell membrane", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nThe rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the diffusion distance. The cell membrane represents the barrier that oxygen molecules must cross to enter a cell, and its thickness determines the diffusion distance. Increasing the thickness of the cell membrane increases the distance over which diffusion must occur. This slows down the net movement of oxygen molecules into the cell, thereby decreasing the overall rate of diffusion.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The concentration gradient is the difference in the concentration of a substance (in this case, oxygen) between two areas (outside and inside the cell). Diffusion is the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient. A steeper or larger concentration gradient provides a greater driving force for this movement. Therefore, increasing the concentration gradient would **increase**, not decrease, the rate of diffusion of oxygen into the cell.\n\n**B:** The surface area is the total area available for diffusion to take place. A larger surface area provides more space for molecules to cross the membrane per unit of time. For this reason, structures adapted for rapid diffusion, such as the alveoli in the lungs, have a very large surface area. Increasing the surface area of the cell membrane would **increase**, not decrease, the rate of diffusion.\n\n**C:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. At higher temperatures, oxygen molecules possess more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and more randomly. This increased molecular motion leads to a faster net movement of molecules across the cell membrane. Consequently, increasing the temperature would **increase**, not decrease, the rate of diffusion."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_7.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "7 which molecule crosses a partially permeable membrane during osmosis?\na carbon dioxide\nb oxygen\nc urea\nd_ water", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nOsmosis is the specific term for the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. This movement occurs from a region where water molecules are in a higher concentration (higher water potential) to a region where they are in a lower concentration (lower water potential). The partially permeable membrane allows small solvent molecules, such as water, to pass through while restricting the passage of larger solute molecules. Therefore, by definition, water is the molecule that moves during osmosis.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: carbon dioxide**\nWhile carbon dioxide molecules are small enough to pass through a partially permeable membrane, their movement is not described as osmosis. The net movement of carbon dioxide across a membrane occurs down its own concentration gradient, a process known as simple diffusion. Osmosis exclusively refers to the movement of water.\n\n**B: oxygen**\nSimilar to carbon dioxide, oxygen molecules can cross a partially permeable membrane. This process is simple diffusion, where oxygen moves from an area of higher oxygen concentration to an area of lower oxygen concentration. This is distinct from osmosis, which is specifically the diffusion of water molecules.\n\n**C: urea**\nUrea is a solute molecule. The presence of solutes like urea is what creates a water potential gradient, which in turn drives osmosis (the movement of water). While small solutes like urea may be able to slowly diffuse across a partially permeable membrane, their movement is not osmosis. Osmosis describes the movement of the solvent (water), not the solute."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_8.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 the diagrams show the movement of particles across a membrane. the arrows show the\ndirection of movement.\nwhich diagram shows active transport?\na b cc d\n' le . li . l. om l. @\nogee les | wt. ol. \u00ab|\n\u2014s \u00b0 +. : # \u00ae ag . \u2018 al .\n- i, - ie, -it. =\",\nusing energy not using energy using energy not using energy\nfrom respiration from respiration from respiration from respiration", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nActive transport is the movement of particles across a cell membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration. This movement is against the concentration gradient and therefore requires energy, which is supplied by the process of respiration. Diagram A correctly illustrates both of these key features: the particles are moving from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration, and it is explicitly stated that this process uses energy from respiration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis diagram shows the movement of particles against a concentration gradient (from low to high concentration), which is a characteristic of active transport. However, it incorrectly states that the process is *not* using energy. Movement against a concentration gradient is an energy-dependent process. Therefore, this diagram is biologically incorrect as it describes a process that cannot occur.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis diagram shows particles moving down a concentration gradient, from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This type of movement is characteristic of diffusion, which is a passive process and does not require metabolic energy. The diagram incorrectly states that energy from respiration is being used. Active transport requires both energy and movement *against* the concentration gradient, so this diagram is incorrect.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis diagram illustrates the process of diffusion, where particles move down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration) without the use of energy from respiration. While this is a valid method of transport across a membrane, it is a passive process. Active transport is fundamentally different because it moves substances *against* the concentration gradient and requires an input of energy."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_9.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "9 which substance is used to test a food for vitamin c?\na_ benedict\u2019s solution\nb- dcpip\nc_ ethanol\nd iodine solution", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\n**Explanation:**\nDCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) is a blue redox indicator used to test for the presence of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is a powerful reducing agent. When a solution containing vitamin C is added to DCPIP, the vitamin C reduces the DCPIP molecule. This chemical reduction causes the DCPIP to change from its oxidised blue state to a reduced, colourless state. The disappearance of the blue colour is a positive test for vitamin C. This titration method can also be used to quantify and compare the concentration of vitamin C in different food samples.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) Benedict's solution:**\nBenedict's solution is used to test for the presence of reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, maltose). The test involves adding Benedict's solution to a food sample and heating the mixture in a water bath. A positive result is indicated by a colour change from blue to green, yellow, orange, or brick-red, depending on the concentration of the reducing sugar. This reagent does not test for vitamin C.\n\n**C) Ethanol:**\nEthanol is primarily used as a solvent in the emulsion test for fats and oils (lipids). In this procedure, the food sample is shaken with ethanol to dissolve any lipids. The resulting solution is then poured into water. If lipids are present, they will precipitate out of the solution, forming a white, cloudy emulsion. Ethanol itself is not an indicator and is not used to test for vitamin C.\n\n**D) Iodine solution:**\nIodine solution is used to test for the presence of starch. When iodine is added to a substance containing starch, it forms a blue-black complex, which is a positive result. In the absence of starch, the iodine solution remains its original brown or yellowish-brown colour.

They are large, complex molecules with a highly specific three-dimensional shape. This structure is formed by one or more long chains of amino acids, which are folded precisely.

The specific sequence of amino acids determines the final 3D shape of the enzyme, including its active site, which is crucial for its catalytic function.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) fatty acids**\nFatty acids are the monomer units that make up lipids (fats and oils). Lipids primarily function as long-term energy stores, for insulation, and as structural components of cell membranes. They do not form the complex, globular three-dimensional structures with specific active sites that are necessary for enzymatic activity.\n\n**B) glycogen**\nGlycogen is a complex carbohydrate (a polysaccharide).

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or permanently altered in the process. In an enzyme-controlled reaction, the reactant molecules, known as substrates, bind to the enzyme's active site. The enzyme facilitates the chemical conversion of the substrate into products. Once the products are formed, they are released from the active site. The enzyme molecule is then free and unchanged, ready to bind with another substrate molecule. Therefore, at the conclusion of the reaction, the mixture will contain the newly formed products and the original enzyme molecules.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. enzymes and substrates:**\nSubstrates are the starting materials or reactants in an enzyme-controlled reaction. By definition, a reaction involves the conversion of substrates into products. The phrase \"at the end of a reaction\" implies that the process has run to completion, meaning all or most of the available substrate has been used up and converted. Therefore, you would expect to find products, not the initial substrates, remaining along with the enzymes.\n\n**C. enzymes only:**\nThis is incorrect because it ignores the outcome of the reaction. The entire purpose of an enzyme-controlled reaction is to produce a specific product from a substrate. The products are the result of the catalytic action of the enzyme and will accumulate in the reaction mixture. It is biochemically incorrect to suggest that the products would not be present at the end.\n\n**D. products only:**\nThis is incorrect because it fails to account for the nature of enzymes as catalysts. Enzymes are not reactants; they are not consumed or used up during the reaction they catalyze. After releasing the product, the enzyme molecule remains intact and is available to facilitate further reactions.

The large intestine consists of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. Its primary functions are to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter and then pass useless waste material from the body. Therefore, the colon and rectum are correctly identified as parts of the large intestine. The small intestine is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.

Inside the tubing, the enzyme protease will catalyse the breakdown of large protein molecules into their smaller constituent units, amino acids. This process is effective at 35\u00b0C, which is a suitable temperature for enzyme activity. Simple sugars are, by definition, already small molecules.\n\nThe membrane surrounding the tubing is selectively permeable, allowing only small molecules to pass through. Consequently, the small amino acid molecules produced from protein digestion and the small simple sugar molecules that were initially present will diffuse from the area of higher concentration (inside the tubing) to the area of lower concentration (the surrounding distilled water). Therefore, after 45 minutes, both amino acids and simple sugars will be found in the water.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. protein and amino acids**\nThis option is incorrect because protein molecules are large macromolecules. The membrane is only permeable to small molecules, so proteins cannot pass through it from the tubing into the surrounding water. While amino acids (the small products of protein digestion) will pass through, the large protein molecules will not.\n\n**C. protein and simple sugars**\nThis option is incorrect because, similar to the reasoning for option B, protein molecules are too large to pass through the selectively permeable membrane. Although the small simple sugar molecules can diffuse into the surrounding water, the large protein molecules will be retained within the tubing.\n\n**D. starch and simple sugars**\nThis option is incorrect because starch is a large polysaccharide, which is a macromolecule. It is too large to pass through the pores of the selectively permeable membrane. Furthermore, no starch-digesting enzyme (like amylase) is present in the tubing to break it down into smaller sugar molecules.

They are specifically adapted for the uptake of **water** by osmosis, moving from an area of high water potential in the soil to a lower water potential inside the cell. Additionally, root hair cells absorb **mineral ions** (such as nitrates, phosphates, and potassium) from the soil. This process, known as active transport, requires energy (from respiration) because it often moves ions against their concentration gradient, from a lower concentration in the soil to a higher concentration inside the cell. Therefore, both water and mineral ions are the key substances that move from the soil into a root hair cell.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nCarbon dioxide is a crucial reactant for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce their own food. However, photosynthesis primarily occurs in the leaves and other green parts of the plant. Carbon dioxide is obtained from the atmosphere and enters the plant through small pores on the leaves called stomata, not through the roots from the soil. While root cells do require oxygen from air spaces in the soil for aerobic respiration, carbon dioxide is not absorbed from the soil.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nGlucose is a simple sugar that is the primary product of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of leaf cells, not in the roots. The glucose produced is then transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant, including the roots, to provide energy for cellular processes like active transport. Glucose is therefore a source of energy for the root cell, but it is not a substance that is absorbed from the soil. While water is absorbed from the soil, glucose is not.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhile it is correct that mineral ions are absorbed from the soil by root hair cells through active transport, glucose is not. Glucose is the sugar produced by the plant during photosynthesis in the leaves. It is then transported to the root cells to be used as an energy source. Plants do not absorb glucose from the soil; they manufacture it themselves. Because glucose is not taken up from the soil, this option is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_18.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "18 by which process does water escape from stomata in the leaves?\na active transport\nb_ diffusion\nc_ evaporation\nd_ osmosis", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. diffusion**\n\nThe process by which water escapes from the stomata is diffusion. Transpiration involves water evaporating from the surfaces of the spongy mesophyll cells inside the leaf, creating a high concentration of water vapour in the air spaces. Typically, the concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere outside the leaf is lower. This difference in water vapour concentration creates a concentration gradient. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Consequently, water vapour molecules move down this concentration gradient, from the air spaces inside the leaf, through the open stomata, and into the surrounding air.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. active transport**\n\nActive transport is the movement of substances across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, a process that requires metabolic energy in the form of ATP. The escape of water from the stomata is a passive process driven by a physical concentration gradient of water vapour. It does not require the plant to expend energy.\n\n**C. evaporation**\n\nEvaporation is the process by which a liquid turns into a gas. While evaporation is a crucial part of transpiration, it occurs *before* the water escapes the stomata. Specifically, liquid water on the surfaces of the spongy mesophyll cells evaporates to become water vapour within the air spaces of the leaf. The question asks for the process of *escape from the stomata*, which is the movement of this water vapour out of the leaf, and that movement is driven by diffusion.\n\n**D. osmosis**\n\nOsmosis is a specific type of diffusion involving the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. While osmosis is responsible for the movement of water from the xylem vessels into the leaf cells, the escape of water vapour from the leaf into the atmosphere does not occur across a partially permeable membrane. The stomata are pores, or openings, not membranes.

Its powerful contractions, specifically of the ventricles, generate the pressure required to move blood through the arteries to all parts of the body. Both the heart and the veins contain valves. The heart has four valves (tricuspid, bicuspid/mitral, aortic, and pulmonary) that ensure blood flows in a single direction through its chambers. Veins, particularly those in the limbs, contain valves to prevent the backflow of blood as it returns to the heart under lower pressure and against gravity.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** While the heart pumps blood, blood vessels do not. Arteries have muscular and elastic walls that help maintain blood pressure, but they do not actively pump blood. Furthermore, not all blood vessels have valves. Arteries and capillaries lack valves; only veins contain them to prevent the backflow of blood.\n\n**C:** Capillaries are the site of exchange of substances between the blood and body tissues. Their walls are only one cell thick to facilitate efficient diffusion and they lack muscle tissue, so they cannot pump blood. Although the heart does contain valves, the first part of the statement is incorrect, making the entire row incorrect.\n\n**D:** While it is correct that the heart pumps blood, the statement that capillaries and arteries have valves is incorrect. Arteries are high-pressure vessels where the force of the heart's contraction prevents backflow, so they do not require valves (with the exception of the semilunar valves at the junction with the heart).

The heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygenated blood to function, which is delivered by the coronary arteries. In CHD, these coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked by the gradual build-up of fatty substances, called atheromas, on their inner walls. This process is known as atherosclerosis. The narrowing restricts blood flow, and if a piece of the atheroma breaks away, a blood clot can form and completely block the artery, leading to a heart attack. Therefore, it is the arteries, specifically the coronary arteries, that are blocked in this disease.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. atria**\nThe atria are the two upper chambers of the heart. Their function is to receive blood returning to the heart\u2014deoxygenated blood from the body into the right atrium and oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left atrium. They are muscular chambers, not the blood vessels that supply the heart tissue. While conditions like atrial fibrillation can lead to blood clots forming within the atria, coronary heart disease is defined by the blockage of the coronary blood vessels, not the heart chambers.\n\n**C. veins**\nVeins are blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart from the body (with the exception of the pulmonary veins). Coronary heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis, a process that primarily affects arteries due to the higher pressure and shear stress of the blood flowing within them. Veins operate under much lower pressure and are not typically affected by atherosclerosis. The blockage in CHD occurs in the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, not the veins that drain blood from it.\n\n**D. ventricles**\nThe ventricles are the two large, muscular lower chambers of the heart that pump blood out of the heart. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body. Similar to atria, ventricles are chambers, not blood vessels. A blockage in a coronary artery can cause damage to the muscle tissue of the ventricles, impairing their function.

While some bacteria are pathogenic and cause diseases (e.g., *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* causes tuberculosis), many species of bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to other organisms and ecosystems.

A key product of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration in yeast is carbon dioxide gas (CO\u2082). In the experimental setup, the gas produced by the yeast in the first test tube is channelled through a delivery tube and bubbled into the second test tube containing an indicator. The standard chemical test for carbon dioxide involves bubbling the gas through limewater (an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide). Carbon dioxide reacts with the limewater to produce calcium carbonate, which is a white, insoluble precipitate. This precipitate is what causes the initially clear limewater to turn cloudy or milky.

Seeds, like other living organisms, take in oxygen for aerobic respiration. Carbon dioxide is a product, not a reactant. The chemical is placed to absorb the product (carbon dioxide), not the reactant (oxygen).\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for the same reasons as A regarding the gases involved in respiration.

Movement away would imply an increase in gas volume or pressure, which is contrary to the process occurring.\n\n**D:** This option correctly identifies that seeds take in oxygen and the chemical absorbs carbon dioxide. However, it incorrectly predicts the direction of movement of the coloured liquid.

Anaerobic respiration produces carbon dioxide.**\n\nYeast is a single-celled fungus used in bread-making as a leavening agent, which means it makes the dough rise. When yeast is mixed into dough, it initially respires aerobically using the available oxygen. However, this oxygen is quickly used up. The yeast then switches to anaerobic respiration, a process that does not require oxygen. During anaerobic respiration, the yeast breaks down sugars (from the flour) into ethanol (an alcohol) and carbon dioxide. The bubbles of carbon dioxide gas become trapped in the gluten network of the dough, causing it to expand and rise. This is the essential process that gives bread its light, airy texture. While ethanol is also produced, it is the carbon dioxide that is responsible for leavening the bread.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Aerobic respiration produces alcohol.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Aerobic respiration is the process of breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen. In yeast, the products of aerobic respiration are carbon dioxide and water, along with a significant amount of energy (ATP). Alcohol (ethanol) is a product of *anaerobic* respiration (fermentation), which occurs in the absence of oxygen.\n\n**B. Aerobic respiration produces lactic acid.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as stated above, the products of aerobic respiration in yeast are carbon dioxide and water, not lactic acid. Secondly, yeast does not produce lactic acid at all. Lactic acid fermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration that occurs in certain bacteria (used in yoghurt production) and in animal muscle cells during strenuous exercise when oxygen supply is limited. Yeast undergoes alcoholic fermentation.\n\n**C. Anaerobic respiration produces alcohol.**\n\nWhile this statement is factually correct\u2014yeast does produce alcohol (ethanol) during anaerobic respiration\u2014it is not the primary reason yeast is used in bread-making. The main purpose of adding yeast to dough is to make it rise. The rising is caused by the production of carbon dioxide gas, not the alcohol. The alcohol produced contributes to the flavour of the bread but is largely evaporated during the baking process.

When blood glucose concentration rises, for example, after a carbohydrate-rich meal, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin acts on target cells, primarily in the liver and muscles, stimulating them to increase their uptake of glucose from the blood.

Glucagon is another hormone produced by the pancreas, but it has an antagonistic (opposite) effect to insulin. Glucagon is released when blood glucose levels are low.

They achieve this by targeting structures or metabolic pathways unique to bacterial cells, such as the synthesis of the cell wall. Therefore, antibiotics are effective against susceptible bacterial infections.\n\nHowever, antibiotics are not effective against all pathogens. Viruses have a fundamentally different structure from bacteria; they are not cells and lack the specific targets that antibiotics act upon. Consequently, antibiotics cannot kill viruses.\n\nFurthermore, through the process of natural selection, some bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics. These resistant bacteria possess genetic traits that allow them to survive and multiply even in the presence of an antibiotic. Therefore, infections caused by resistant bacteria cannot be successfully treated with that specific antibiotic.\n\nThis combination explains why only some infections are treatable with antibiotics: they are effective against susceptible bacteria but ineffective against viruses and resistant bacteria.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly states that antibiotics can kill resistant bacteria. By definition, antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of an antibiotic. If a bacterium is resistant, the antibiotic is no longer effective against it. While antibiotics do kill non-resistant bacteria and do not kill viruses, their inability to kill resistant strains is a key reason why some bacterial infections are difficult to treat.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it claims that antibiotics do not kill bacteria but are effective against viruses. The primary function of antibiotics is precisely to act against bacteria (they are antibacterial agents). Conversely, antibiotics are completely ineffective against viruses because viruses lack the cellular machinery and structures (like cell walls) that antibiotics target.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option incorrectly reverses the effects of antibiotics. It suggests that antibiotics do not kill susceptible bacteria but are effective against resistant bacteria and viruses. This is biologically inaccurate. Antibiotics are designed to kill susceptible bacteria. They are ineffective against viruses, and by definition, they cannot kill bacteria that have developed resistance to them. The idea that an antibiotic would kill a resistant strain but not a susceptible one is a contradiction."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_30.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 the diagram shows part of a flower.\nxx\nwi\n\\ y,\nvans\nt\n\\y za\nwhat is the part labelled x?\na anther\nb_ ovary\nc_sepal\nd stigma", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. stigma**\nThe stigma is the receptive tip of the carpel, the female reproductive organ of a flower.

In any ecosystem, energy flows from one trophic level to the next. The diagram shows that the herbivore trophic level receives a total of 15,000 kJ of energy from consuming plants. Organisms at each trophic level use a large portion of the energy they consume for their own life processes, such as respiration, movement, growth, and reproduction. This energy is ultimately lost to the environment, primarily as heat. The diagram indicates that the herbivores lose 13,200 kJ of energy. The energy that remains is stored in the herbivores' biomass. It is this stored energy that is available to be transferred to the next trophic level, the carnivores, when they consume the herbivores. Therefore, the energy transferred is the initial energy assimilated by the herbivores minus the energy they lost.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 15 000 kJ + 13 200 kJ**\n\nThis calculation is incorrect because it adds the energy lost by the herbivores to the total energy they initially received.

Adding these two values does not represent a biologically meaningful energy transfer.\n\n**C. 88 000 kJ + 15 000 kJ**\n\nThis calculation is incorrect as it combines energy values from different and non-sequential parts of the food chain. The 88,000 kJ represents the initial solar energy available to the producers (plants), while the 15,000 kJ is the energy transferred from plants to herbivores.

Genetic modification in bacteria often involves inserting a gene for a desired product, such as human insulin, into a bacterial plasmid. Once a bacterium has been successfully modified to contain this new gene, it can be grown in a fermenter. Bacteria reproduce asexually by binary fission, a process that can occur as quickly as every 20 minutes under optimal conditions. This leads to an exponential growth in the bacterial population. As each new bacterium is a clone of the original, they all carry the inserted gene. This rapid multiplication allows for the production of vast quantities of the desired protein in a very short time, making the process highly efficient and commercially viable for manufacturing medicines and other valuable substances.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. They can only make simple molecules.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bacteria are capable of synthesising a wide range of complex organic molecules, including proteins, which are large polymers of amino acids.

This can be through autotrophic means, like photosynthesis in plants, or heterotrophic means, like consumption in animals. **Excretion** is the removal of waste products from metabolic reactions within the body, such as carbon dioxide from respiration. Since all organisms need energy and produce metabolic waste, both nutrition and excretion are universal characteristics of life.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. egestion and excretion**\nWhile excretion is a universal characteristic of all living things, egestion is not. Egestion is the process of discharging undigested food as faeces. This process is only carried out by organisms that ingest solid food, such as animals. Organisms like plants, which produce their own food via photosynthesis, do not perform egestion. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it does not apply to all organisms.\n\n**B. egestion and nutrition**\nWhile nutrition is a universal characteristic of all living things, egestion is not. Egestion, the removal of undigested material, is not performed by all organisms. For example, autotrophs like plants create their own food and do not have a digestive system that produces faeces. Since egestion is not a universal life process, this option is incorrect.\n\n**D. excretion and photosynthesis**\nWhile excretion is a universal characteristic, photosynthesis is not.

Its pores are small enough for water molecules to pass through but are too small for the larger sucrose molecules. Therefore, there is no net movement of sucrose molecules out of the bag.\n4.  **Mass of the Bag:** Since water moves into the bag and no sucrose moves out, the overall volume and content of the bag increase. This results in an increase in the mass of the bag.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the bag increases, there is no net movement of sucrose, and there is a net movement of water into the bag.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**Option A is incorrect.** This option suggests the mass of the bag decreased due to water moving out of the bag.

Water moves down its potential gradient, from the high potential of the distilled water to the lower potential of the sucrose solution inside the bag.\n\n**Option B is incorrect.** This option makes two errors. Firstly, it claims the mass decreased and water moved out of the bag, which is incorrect as water moves into the bag down its water potential gradient.

This specificity is determined by the unique three-dimensional shape of the enzyme's active site. According to the lock-and-key model of enzyme action, the shape of the substrate must be complementary to the shape of the active site for binding to occur, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. In this case, the active site of enzyme X has a specific indentation. Substrate D has a shape that is precisely complementary to this active site, allowing it to fit perfectly, much like a key fits into a lock. This complementary fit enables the enzyme to perform its catalytic function on the substrate.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThe principle of enzyme-substrate specificity dictates that an enzyme's active site has a shape that is complementary to its specific substrate. Substrate A is a square. The shape of this molecule does not match the indentation of the active site of enzyme X. The right-angled corners and straight sides of the square will not fit into the angled, trapezoidal active site. Therefore, an enzyme-substrate complex cannot be formed, and enzyme X cannot act on substrate A.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nEnzyme action relies on the specific binding of a substrate to the enzyme's active site, which requires complementary shapes. Substrate B has a shape with a pointed top. The active site of enzyme X, however, has a wide, flat-bottomed indentation. The pointed structure of substrate B is not complementary to the shape of the active site and would be unable to bind correctly. Consequently, no enzyme-substrate complex would form, making B an incorrect substrate for enzyme X.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nEnzymes are highly specific due to the unique shape of their active site, which only allows a substrate with a complementary shape to bind. Substrate C is a triangle. The pointed shape of the triangle is not complementary to the active site of enzyme X, which has a distinct flat base and angled sides.

However, the rate of photosynthesis is significantly greater than the rate of respiration under these conditions. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the surrounding hydrogencarbonate indicator solution, while respiration releases a smaller amount of CO\u2082. Consequently, there is a net decrease in the concentration of CO\u2082 in the solution.\n\nHydrogencarbonate indicator is sensitive to the concentration of CO\u2082. A decrease in CO\u2082 concentration makes the solution more alkaline. In alkaline conditions, the hydrogencarbonate indicator turns purple. Therefore, after three hours of active photosynthesis, the solution's colour will change from orange to purple.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: blue-black**\nThis colour is incorrect because blue-black is the characteristic result of the iodine test for the presence of starch. The experiment uses hydrogencarbonate indicator, which measures the concentration of carbon dioxide, not the presence of starch. The two indicators and tests are unrelated.\n\n**B: orange**\nThe orange colour indicates a normal atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which was the starting condition of the experiment. For the colour to remain orange, the net exchange of CO\u2082 between the plant and the solution would have to be zero. This would only occur if the rate of photosynthesis exactly equalled the rate of respiration. In the presence of sufficient light, the rate of photosynthesis will exceed the rate of respiration, leading to a net consumption of CO\u2082 and thus a colour change.\n\n**D: yellow**\nA yellow colour in hydrogencarbonate indicator signifies a high concentration of carbon dioxide, which makes the solution acidic. This would occur if the rate of respiration were greater than the rate of photosynthesis, leading to a net release of CO\u2082 into the solution.

A **large surface area** is a key adaptation as it maximises the exposure of the leaf to sunlight, which provides the energy for the photosynthetic process. The broad, flat shape of most leaves ensures that a maximum number of chloroplasts, particularly in the palisade mesophyll layer, can absorb light.\n\nFurthermore, being **thin** is crucial. This provides a short diffusion pathway for gases. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters the leaf through stomata and needs to reach the photosynthesising cells quickly. A thin structure minimises this diffusion distance, ensuring a rapid and efficient supply of carbon dioxide. It also allows sunlight to penetrate through the upper layers of cells to reach all photosynthetic tissues.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) They have a large surface area and are thick.**\nWhile a large surface area is an effective adaptation for capturing sunlight, a thick leaf structure is not. A thick leaf would increase the diffusion distance for carbon dioxide to travel from the stomata to the palisade mesophyll cells. This would slow down the rate at which carbon dioxide reaches the chloroplasts, thereby limiting the overall rate of photosynthesis.\n\n**C) They have a small surface area and are thick.**\nThis combination of features is poorly adapted for photosynthesis. A small surface area would severely limit the amount of sunlight the leaf could absorb, reducing the energy available for the process. A thick structure would further hinder photosynthesis by creating a long diffusion path for carbon dioxide, slowing its delivery to the photosynthesising cells. (Note: Plants in dry environments may have small, thick leaves, but this is an adaptation to conserve water, not to maximise photosynthesis).\n\n**D) They have a small surface area and are thin.**\nAlthough a thin structure is an advantageous adaptation for rapid gas diffusion, it is paired here with a small surface area. A small surface area is a significant disadvantage as it restricts the amount of light that can be captured. For photosynthesis to be maximised, both efficient light capture and rapid gas exchange are necessary.

Each haemoglobin molecule is composed of four protein chains and four 'haem' groups. At the centre of each haem group is an atom of iron. This iron atom is the specific site where oxygen binds. Therefore, iron is an essential dietary mineral for the synthesis of haemoglobin. A deficiency in dietary iron leads to a condition called iron-deficiency anaemia, which is characterised by a low concentration of haemoglobin in the blood. The person's haemoglobin level of 80 g/dm\u00b3 is significantly below the normal range, indicating a likely case of anaemia caused by a lack of iron.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A. calcium**\n\nCalcium is a mineral vital for several biological functions, including the formation and maintenance of strong bones and teeth, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. However, calcium is not a component of the haemoglobin molecule and is not directly involved in its synthesis. A deficiency in calcium would lead to conditions such as osteoporosis (weak bones) or impaired blood clotting, but it would not cause a low haemoglobin concentration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B. fats**\n\nFats (lipids) are an essential macronutrient in the diet. Their primary roles include providing a concentrated source of energy, forming structural components of cell membranes, insulating the body, protecting vital organs, and aiding in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Fats are not involved in the chemical structure or synthesis of haemoglobin. While a balanced diet is necessary for overall health, a specific deficiency in fats would not be the direct cause of a low haemoglobin count.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C. fibre**\n\nDietary fibre is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested by human enzymes. Its main function is to aid in the digestive process by adding bulk to the faeces, which stimulates peristalsis (the wave-like muscle contractions of the intestinal wall) and helps prevent constipation. Fibre is crucial for maintaining a healthy digestive system but has no role in the production of red blood cells or the synthesis of haemoglobin.

By breaking a large food particle into numerous smaller ones, the total surface area exposed to digestive juices is significantly increased. This is crucial because it allows digestive enzymes to work more efficiently, speeding up the rate of chemical digestion.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. It involves enzymes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The involvement of enzymes is the defining characteristic of **chemical digestion**, not physical digestion. Enzymes are biological catalysts that break down large, complex food molecules (like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) into their smaller, simpler component molecules (like amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids). Physical digestion is a mechanical process that does not involve chemical reactions or enzymes.\n\n**C. It takes place in the mouth only.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While physical digestion begins in the mouth with chewing, it continues in other parts of the digestive system. The muscular walls of the stomach contract to churn and mix the food with gastric juices, which is a form of physical digestion. In the small intestine, bile emulsifies large fat globules into smaller droplets, another form of physical digestion that increases the surface area for lipase enzymes to act upon.\n\n**D. It produces smaller molecules.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. This describes the outcome of **chemical digestion**. Chemical digestion breaks down large macromolecules into smaller, simpler molecules by breaking chemical bonds. For example, starch (a large molecule) is broken down into glucose (a small molecule). Physical digestion, in contrast, breaks down large *pieces* of food into smaller *pieces* of the same food. It does not change the chemical composition of the food or produce different, smaller molecules."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_56.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "16 solid food enters the mouth at p and enters the oesophagus at q.\np \u2014,\nq\nhow does the food at q differ from the food at p?\na it contains less fibre.\nb_ it contains less water.\nc_ it contains less protein.\nd_ it contains less starch.", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nChemical digestion begins in the mouth. Saliva, produced by the salivary glands, contains the enzyme salivary amylase. This enzyme starts the process of carbohydrate digestion by breaking down large, complex starch molecules into smaller, simpler sugar molecules (maltose). Therefore, as the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, the amount of starch within it decreases before it is swallowed and enters the oesophagus.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. It contains less fibre.**\nFibre, which is primarily cellulose from plant cell walls, cannot be chemically digested by humans. The human digestive system does not produce the enzyme cellulase, which is required to break down cellulose. Consequently, the amount of fibre in the food remains unchanged as it passes from the mouth to the oesophagus.\n\n**B. It contains less water.**\nIn the mouth, food is mixed with saliva to lubricate it and begin chemical digestion. Saliva is composed of approximately 99% water. This addition of saliva increases the overall water content of the food, forming a moist ball called a bolus, which is easier to swallow. Therefore, the food at Q contains more water, not less.\n\n**C. It contains less protein.**\nThe chemical digestion of protein does not begin in the mouth. Saliva does not contain any proteases (protein-digesting enzymes). Protein digestion starts later in the digestive system, specifically in the stomach, where the enzyme pepsin acts in an acidic environment. Thus, the amount of protein in the food is unaltered between the mouth and the oesophagus."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_57.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "17 which row shows the functions of xylem and phloem?\ntransports transports transports\namino acids mineral ions sucrose\na phloem xylem phloem\nb xylem xylem phloem\ncc xylem phloem xylem\nd phloem phloem xylem", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe transport systems in plants, xylem and phloem, have distinct functions.\n\n*   **Phloem:** This tissue is responsible for the transport of soluble organic substances, known as assimilates, which are produced during photosynthesis. This process is called translocation. The primary substance transported is sucrose, but amino acids are also transported in the phloem sap. This transport occurs from the source (e.g., leaves) to the sink (e.g., roots, fruits, flowers). Therefore, phloem transports both amino acids and sucrose.\n*   **Xylem:** This tissue is primarily responsible for the transport of water from the roots up to the rest of the plant. Dissolved in this water are mineral ions, which are absorbed from the soil by the roots. Thus, xylem transports mineral ions.\n\nRow A correctly identifies that phloem transports amino acids and sucrose, and xylem transports mineral ions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly states that xylem transports amino acids. Amino acids are organic molecules produced by the plant and are transported in the phloem along with sucrose. While this option correctly identifies that xylem transports mineral ions and phloem transports sucrose, the first column is incorrect, making the entire row invalid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly assigns the functions of xylem and phloem. It claims xylem transports amino acids and sucrose, which is incorrect; these are transported by the phloem. It also claims phloem transports mineral ions, which is also incorrect; mineral ions are transported by the xylem.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly states that phloem transports mineral ions and that xylem transports sucrose. Mineral ions are transported in the water-conducting xylem tissue, not the phloem. Sucrose, the main product of photosynthesis for transport, is moved via the phloem in a process called translocation, not via the xylem.

Their primary function is to significantly increase the surface area of the root system. Water and mineral ions are absorbed from the soil across this surface. A larger surface area allows for a more efficient and rapid rate of absorption. Therefore, if a plant does not have root hairs, its total surface area for absorption is drastically reduced. This directly results in a lower rate of water uptake from the soil, as water is absorbed by osmosis across the root surface.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B) The plant absorbs more water from the soil.**\nThis is incorrect. The absence of root hairs leads to a significantly smaller surface area for absorption. A reduced surface area diminishes the plant's capacity to take up water, leading to less, not more, water absorption.\n\n**C) The plant loses water to the soil.**\nThis statement describes water movement that is contrary to the normal physiological process. Water moves by osmosis from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. Typically, the cytoplasm of root cells contains solutes, creating a lower water potential than the surrounding soil water, which causes water to move *into* the roots. The absence of root hairs affects the rate of this inward movement but does not reverse its direction under normal soil conditions.\n\n**D) The plant loses mineral ions to the soil.**\nThis is incorrect. Mineral ions are absorbed from the soil and accumulate in root cells, primarily through active transport. This process moves ions against their concentration gradient, meaning the concentration is higher inside the root than in the soil. The cell surface membrane is selectively permeable and prevents these valuable ions from diffusing back out into the soil. A lack of root hairs would impair the *uptake* of mineral ions due to reduced surface area, but it would not cause their loss."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_59.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "19 which statements describe how the structures in the circulatory system function?\n1 amuscular pump to push blood into vessels\n2 valves to ensure one-way blood flow\n3. veins to take blood away from the heart\n4 vessels to return blood to the heart\na 1,2and3 b 1,2and4 c 1,3 and4 d 2,3 and4", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is correct because it combines three accurate descriptions of the circulatory system's functions.\n1.  **A muscular pump (the heart):** The heart is a powerful muscular organ whose contractions generate the pressure required to push blood into the arteries and circulate it throughout the entire body.\n2.  **Valves:** The circulatory system contains valves within the heart (between the atria and ventricles, and at the exit of the ventricles) and within the veins.

Antibiotics are medications specifically designed to combat bacterial infections. They function by either killing the bacteria (bactericidal effect) or by inhibiting their growth and reproduction (bacteriostatic effect). They achieve this by targeting specific structures or metabolic processes unique to bacterial cells, such as the synthesis of the cell wall or protein production by ribosomes, which are different from those in human cells.\n\nStatement 3 is also correct. Antibiotic resistance is a phenomenon where bacteria evolve, through random genetic mutations or by acquiring resistance genes from other bacteria, to survive exposure to an antibiotic. These resistant bacteria may have developed mechanisms to neutralise the antibiotic, alter its target site, or pump it out of the cell. Consequently, the antibiotic is no longer effective in treating infections caused by these resistant strains.\n\nSince statements 1 and 3 are correct, this option is the correct choice.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) 1, 2 and 3:** This option is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Viruses are fundamentally different from bacteria; they are not cells and lack the cellular structures and metabolic pathways (like cell walls or their own ribosomes) that antibiotics target. Therefore, antibiotics have no mechanism to act upon them.\n\n**B) 1 and 2 only:** This option is incorrect because it includes the false statement 2. While statement 1 is correct, antibiotics cannot be used to treat viral infections such as the common cold or influenza. Using antibiotics for viral illnesses is ineffective and contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n**D) 2 and 3 only:** This option is incorrect because it includes the false statement 2 and excludes the correct statement 1.

This process of fusion is called fertilisation. During fertilisation, the genetic material from the two gametes combines to form a single cell called a zygote. The zygote contains a full set of chromosomes, half from each parent, and develops into a new, genetically unique individual. Therefore, fertilisation is an essential and defining characteristic of sexual reproduction.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Zygotes fuse.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A zygote is the cell that is *formed* as a result of fertilisation, which is the fusion of gametes (e.g., a sperm and an egg). The zygote itself does not fuse with other cells; instead, it undergoes repeated cell divisions (mitosis) to develop into an embryo and eventually a complete organism. It is the gametes that fuse, not the zygotes.\n\n**C. Offspring are always genetically identical.**\nThis statement describes asexual reproduction, not sexual reproduction. A key feature of sexual reproduction is the creation of genetic variation. By combining genes from two different parents through the processes of meiosis and random fertilisation, the resulting offspring are genetically different from both parents and from each other (with the exception of identical twins). This genetic variation is crucial for the adaptation and survival of species.\n\n**D. One female gamete fuses with many male gametes.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In nearly all species, fertilisation involves the fusion of one male gamete with one female gamete. This ensures that the resulting zygote has the correct diploid number of chromosomes. Organisms have biological mechanisms, such as the cortical reaction in animals, to prevent polyspermy\u2014the fertilisation of an egg by more than one sperm\u2014as this would lead to an incorrect amount of genetic material and is typically lethal to the embryo."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_72.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "32 which row about asexual reproduction is correct?\n|r se se\nparents parents each other\na one no yes\nb one yes yes\ncc two no no\nd two yes no", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAsexual reproduction is a biological process where a single parent organism produces offspring.

In asexual reproduction, the offspring are genetic clones of the single parent because they receive all of their DNA from that one individual.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it states that two parents are involved. Asexual reproduction, by definition, involves only one parent. The involvement of two parents, leading to offspring that are not identical to the parents or each other, is characteristic of sexual reproduction, not asexual reproduction.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect as it states that two parents are involved, which is a feature of sexual reproduction.

It is defined as a specific sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule that carries the instructions for synthesising a functional product. In most cases, this product is a protein. The sequence of nucleotide bases in a gene dictates the sequence of amino acids that will be assembled to form a specific polypeptide chain, which then folds into a functional protein. Therefore, a gene is correctly described as a length of DNA that codes for a protein.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: amino acid**\nAn amino acid is a small organic molecule that serves as the monomer, or building block, of proteins. A chain of amino acids, linked by peptide bonds, forms a polypeptide. The specific sequence of these amino acids is determined by the genetic code within a gene, but an amino acid itself is a chemical subunit, not a length of DNA.\n\n**B: antibody**\nAn antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance (an antigen). Its function is to identify and neutralise pathogens. Since an antibody is a protein, its specific structure is determined by a gene. It is the *product* of a gene, not the segment of DNA that codes for it.\n\n**C: chromosome**\nA chromosome is a highly organised and condensed structure composed of a very long molecule of DNA tightly coiled around proteins called histones. It is located within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. A single chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes arranged along its length.

A female has two X chromosomes (XX) and a male has one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The mother can only pass on an X chromosome in her ovum (egg cell). The father produces two types of sperm in approximately equal numbers: half carry an X chromosome and half carry a Y chromosome.\n\nIf a sperm carrying an X chromosome fertilises the ovum, the resulting zygote will have XX chromosomes and develop into a female. If a sperm carrying a Y chromosome fertilises the ovum, the zygote will have XY chromosomes and develop into a male.\n\nBecause there are two equally possible outcomes, the probability for each is 1 in 2, or 50%. Each conception is an independent event, meaning the sex of previous children has no influence on the sex of the next child. Therefore, the chance of the next child being a daughter is 50%.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**A: 0%**\nA probability of 0% would mean it is impossible for the man to have a daughter. This would only be possible if the man could not produce any sperm containing an X chromosome. A biologically normal, fertile male produces both X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm, so having a daughter is always a possibility.\n\n**B: 25%**\nThis is incorrect. A 25% probability would imply that there are four equally likely outcomes for the sex of a single child. However, there are only two possibilities for the sperm that fertilises the egg (one carrying an X chromosome or one carrying a Y chromosome), making the probability for a daughter 1 in 2, or 50%. The number of previous children does not alter this fundamental probability.\n\n**D: 100%**\nA probability of 100% would mean it is certain that the next child will be a daughter.

The base of the pyramid is formed by the producers (e.g., plants), which are typically the most numerous. Moving up the pyramid, each successive level represents a higher trophic level. The second level consists of primary consumers (herbivores), followed by secondary consumers (carnivores that eat herbivores), and then tertiary consumers (carnivores that eat other carnivores). Due to significant energy loss at each trophic transfer (approximately 90% is lost), each level can support fewer individuals than the level below it. Consequently, the top of the pyramid represents the highest trophic level, which has the fewest individuals. These are the apex predators, which are carnivores.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B - decomposers**\n\nDecomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, are organisms that break down dead organic matter and waste products from all trophic levels. They play a vital role in recycling nutrients within an ecosystem. However, they are not assigned a specific trophic level in the same way as producers and consumers. Because they obtain nutrients from dead organisms at every level, they are not placed at the top of a standard ecological pyramid.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C - herbivores**\n\nHerbivores are primary consumers that feed on producers. They occupy the second trophic level, directly above the producers at the base of the pyramid. Since herbivores are preyed upon by carnivores (secondary consumers), there are one or more trophic levels above them. Therefore, herbivores are located near the bottom of the pyramid, not at the top.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D - Sun**\n\nThe Sun is the ultimate source of energy for nearly all life on Earth. However, the Sun is an abiotic (non-living) component of an ecosystem. A pyramid of numbers represents the relationships between the biotic (living) organisms.

This corresponds to the parts of the graph where the slope is positive (the curve is rising).\n\n*   **Phase 1 (Lag Phase):** The population is small but beginning to increase as the yeast cells acclimate to the nutrient-rich environment. The curve is rising, indicating that the reproduction rate is greater than the death rate.\n*   **Phase 2 (Exponential/Log Phase):** The population size increases rapidly. There are abundant nutrients and minimal waste products, leading to a reproduction rate that is significantly higher than the death rate. The steep positive slope of the curve in this phase signifies this rapid growth.\n*   **Phase 3 (Stationary Phase):** The population growth slows down and the curve flattens, reaching the carrying capacity of the environment. At this stage, limiting factors such as nutrient depletion, limited space, and the accumulation of toxic waste products (e.g., ethanol) cause the death rate to increase to a level that equals the reproduction rate. Since the rates are balanced, there is no net population growth. Therefore, the reproduction rate is not greater than the death rate.\n*   **Phase 4 (Decline/Death Phase):** The population size decreases as the environment can no longer support it.

This is achieved by inserting a gene from one organism into the DNA of another. The resulting DNA, which contains genetic material from different sources, is called recombinant DNA. This process creates a novel combination of genes within the host organism, leading to the expression of a new trait. For example, a gene for insulin production from humans can be inserted into bacteria, creating a new combination of genes that allows the bacteria to produce human insulin.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: It involves choosing which individual organisms are used for breeding.**\nThis statement describes the process of selective breeding (or artificial selection), not genetic modification. Selective breeding is a traditional method where humans choose organisms with desirable characteristics and breed them together over many generations to enhance those traits in the offspring. In contrast, genetic modification is a modern biotechnological technique that directly manipulates the organism's DNA at a molecular level, often in a single generation.\n\n**B: It is always done using genes from the same species.**\nThis statement is incorrect.

Carbon dioxide is a primary waste product of cellular respiration, a fundamental metabolic process that releases energy in cells. The removal of this carbon dioxide from the animal's body, typically through the respiratory system (e.g., exhaling), is therefore a classic example of excretion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nMovement is the life process that involves an action by an organism, or a part of an organism, leading to a change of position or place.

The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that encloses the cell, regulating the passage of substances into and out of the cell, which is essential for maintaining a stable internal environment (homeostasis). The cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell, providing a medium for all metabolic reactions and suspending cellular components.

In the context of digestion, this property is crucial. Firstly, digestive enzymes, which are responsible for the chemical breakdown of food, can only function effectively when dissolved in water. The aqueous environment allows these enzymes to mix with food particles and catalyse reactions. Secondly, after large food molecules are broken down into smaller, soluble molecules (such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids), water dissolves these products. This allows them to be transported across the wall of the small intestine and absorbed into the bloodstream for use by the body's cells.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: It is an enzyme.**\nThis is incorrect. Enzymes are complex protein molecules that act as biological catalysts, speeding up the rate of biochemical reactions. Water (H\u2082O) is a simple inorganic compound. While water is a reactant in many digestive reactions (specifically, hydrolysis reactions where water is used to split larger molecules), it does not have the structure or catalytic function of an enzyme.\n\n**C: It is soluble.**\nThis is incorrect. The term \"soluble\" describes a property of a solute, which is a substance that dissolves in a solvent. It does not describe the role of the solvent itself. Water acts as the solvent in the digestive system, dissolving other soluble substances. Therefore, describing water as \"soluble\" is a misapplication of the term and does not explain its function in digestion.\n\n**D: It is a mineral.**\nThis is incorrect. In a nutritional context, minerals are inorganic elements required by the body in small amounts for various functions (e.g., calcium for bones, iron for haemoglobin). Water is an inorganic *compound* made of the elements hydrogen and oxygen.

This process requires energy, which is supplied by respiration in the cells. In this case, the concentration of sodium ions is lower in the soil than inside the root hair cells. For the root hair cells to take in more sodium ions, they must move these ions against the concentration gradient. This requires the expenditure of energy, which is characteristic of active transport.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B diffusion**\n\nDiffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. It is a passive process that does not require energy. The scenario described involves moving sodium ions from a lower concentration (the soil) to a higher concentration (the root hair cell), which is the opposite of the direction required for diffusion.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C osmosis**\n\nOsmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. This process specifically describes the movement of water, not mineral ions like sodium. The question concerns the uptake of sodium ions, so osmosis is not the correct process.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D transpiration**\n\nTranspiration is the process by which water is lost from a plant in the form of water vapour, primarily through the stomata in the leaves.

This breakdown occurs through a series of chemical reactions, each of which is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. For example, amylase digests starch, and proteases digest proteins. Therefore, digestion is entirely dependent on enzymes.\n\n3.  **Respiration:** Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that convert chemical energy from glucose into ATP.

This diagram accurately illustrates the relationship between an enzyme, its active site, and its substrate. The enzyme is correctly identified as the larger molecule. The active site is correctly labelled as the specific, indented region on the enzyme's surface. The substrate is correctly labelled as the separate molecule that will bind to the enzyme. Crucially, the diagram shows that the shape of the substrate is complementary to the shape of the active site. This complementarity is known as enzyme-substrate specificity and is essential for the substrate to bind to the active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex and allowing the catalytic reaction to occur.

The active site is not a separate molecule; it is a specific region on the surface of the enzyme molecule. In this diagram, the entire white molecule is labelled 'active site', and the grey molecule is labelled 'enzyme'. The substrate is also incorrectly labelled as the indentation on the white molecule.

It is the primary substrate for cellular respiration. During this process, glucose is chemically broken down to release energy in the form of ATP, which is essential for powering all the plant's metabolic processes, such as growth and active transport.\n*   **Starch for energy storage:** Starch is a large, insoluble polysaccharide made from many glucose units joined together. Plants convert excess glucose into starch for storage. Its insolubility is crucial because it does not affect the water potential of the cells where it is stored (e.g., in chloroplasts, leaves, seeds, or storage organs like tubers). When the plant requires energy, starch can be broken down back into glucose.\n*   **Sucrose for transport:** Sucrose is a disaccharide. Plants convert glucose into sucrose to be transported around the plant through the phloem. Sucrose is less reactive than glucose, making it a more stable molecule for transport from the leaves (the source) to other parts of the plant that need energy but cannot photosynthesise, such as the roots, flowers, or fruits (the sinks).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) cell walls / transport / energy storage**\nThis option is incorrect. Plant cell walls are made of cellulose, which is a structural polysaccharide, not glucose itself. While glucose is the monomer that builds cellulose, its direct function is not forming walls. Furthermore, starch is used for energy storage, not transport, and sucrose is used for transport, not energy storage.\n\n**B) energy storage / cell walls / respiration**\nThis option is incorrect. Glucose is used for immediate energy release through respiration, while starch is the molecule used for long-term energy storage. Plant cell walls are made of cellulose, not starch. While sucrose provides the glucose needed for respiration in sink tissues, glucose is the direct respiratory substrate.\n\n**D) transport / respiration / cell walls**\nThis option is incorrect. Glucose is generally not the primary transport sugar in plants; that role is filled by sucrose. Starch is a storage molecule and must first be hydrolysed into glucose to be used in respiration.

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for the synthesis of collagen, a key structural protein that provides strength and integrity to connective tissues, including skin, blood vessels, cartilage, and gums. Without sufficient vitamin C, collagen cannot be properly formed, leading to the breakdown of these tissues. The symptoms of scurvy, such as swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, poor wound healing, and fragile capillaries that cause easy bruising, are all direct results of this defective collagen synthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. calcium:** A deficiency in the mineral calcium does not cause scurvy. Calcium is crucial for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It is also essential for muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. A lack of calcium can lead to conditions such as rickets in children (soft, weak bones) and osteoporosis in adults (brittle, fragile bones).\n\n**B. iron:** A lack of iron in the diet leads to iron-deficiency anaemia, not scurvy. Iron is a vital component of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that binds to and transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Insufficient iron results in a reduced number of healthy red blood cells, leading to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath due to inadequate oxygen supply to the cells.\n\n**D. vitamin D:** Vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired bone health, not scurvy. The primary function of vitamin D is to regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the gut, which are essential for bone mineralisation.

The question asks for the amount of fibre in a 45 g serving. Since the serving size (45 g) is less than the reference amount (100 g), the amount of fibre consumed must be less than 2.8 g.\n\n**C. 3.5 g**\n\nThis value is incorrect.

This sequence accurately describes the process of water absorption and transpiration. Water first enters the plant from the soil through the root hair cells by osmosis. It then travels across the root cortex cells to reach the xylem vessels located in the center of the root. The xylem forms a continuous tube that transports water up the stem and into the leaves. Within the leaf, water moves from the xylem into the surrounding mesophyll cells. Finally, water evaporates from the surfaces of these cells into the air spaces inside the leaf and then diffuses out into the atmosphere as water vapour through the stomata. This entire process is known as the transpiration stream.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: root hair \u2192 xylem \u2192 mesophyll \u2192 root cortex \u2192 stomata**\nThis option is incorrect because the sequence of tissues in the root is wrong. Water must pass through the root cortex *before* it reaches the xylem. The xylem is the central vascular tissue, and the cortex is the layer of tissue surrounding it.

Water is absorbed by the roots from the soil and is lost from the leaves to the atmosphere.

The rate of transpiration is influenced by several environmental factors.\n\n- **Effect of Temperature:** A lower atmospheric temperature reduces the kinetic energy of water molecules. This slows down the rate of evaporation from the wet surfaces of the mesophyll cells inside the leaf and also reduces the rate at which water vapour diffuses out of the stomata.\n- **Effect of Wind Speed:** Low wind speed allows a layer of humid air (a boundary layer) to accumulate around the leaf surface. This reduces the water potential gradient between the moist air inside the leaf and the air outside. A shallower gradient results in a slower rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata.\n\nTherefore, the combination of low atmospheric temperature and low wind speed results in a slow rate of transpiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. Both low wind speed and low atmospheric temperature are conditions that decrease the rate of transpiration. They reduce the water potential gradient and the rate of evaporation, respectively. Consequently, the transpiration rate would be slow, not fast.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect. High wind speed continuously removes the humid air layer from around the leaf, maintaining a steep water potential gradient, which increases transpiration. High atmospheric temperature increases the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to a higher rate of evaporation and diffusion. Both of these conditions lead to a fast transpiration rate, not a slow one.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect. This row presents conflicting factors. High atmospheric temperature increases the rate of evaporation and would tend to speed up transpiration. Low wind speed, however, allows humid air to build up around the leaf, which would tend to slow down transpiration. While the overall effect depends on the magnitude of each factor, the conditions that most reliably lead to a slow rate are when both factors promote it, as described in option D.

To facilitate this low-pressure flow with minimal resistance, veins possess a large internal diameter, known as the lumen. Correspondingly, because the pressure within veins is low, their walls do not need to be thick and muscular; instead, they are relatively thin with less elastic and muscle tissue compared to arteries.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis option incorrectly pairs an artery with a large lumen. Arteries carry oxygenated blood (except for the pulmonary artery) away from the heart at high pressure. To maintain this high pressure, arteries have a narrow or small lumen relative to their wall thickness. While the description of a thick wall is correct for an artery, the large lumen is a feature of a vein.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option incorrectly pairs an artery with a thin wall. Arteries must withstand the high pressure generated by the heart's contractions. To do this, they have thick, strong, and elastic walls containing a significant amount of muscle and elastic fibres. A thin wall would not be able to withstand this high pressure and would risk rupturing. While the small lumen is a correct feature of an artery, the thin wall is not.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the features of a vein. A small lumen and a thick wall are characteristic features of an artery, not a vein.

This is achieved by having a large surface area and thin walls. A large surface area, such as that provided by the millions of alveoli in the lungs or the numerous lamellae in fish gills, provides more space for diffusion to occur simultaneously. Thin walls, often only one cell thick, create a very short diffusion pathway. According to Fick's Law of Diffusion, the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the surface area and inversely proportional to the diffusion distance (thickness). Therefore, the combination of a large surface area and thin walls ensures the most rapid and efficient exchange of gases possible to meet the metabolic demands of the animal.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nWhile a large surface area is a correct and essential feature for an efficient gas exchange surface, having thick walls would be a major disadvantage. A thick wall increases the distance that gases must diffuse across. This increased diffusion pathway would significantly slow down the rate of gas exchange, making it insufficient to supply the necessary oxygen to the body's cells or to remove waste carbon dioxide effectively.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option describes the least effective combination of features for a gas exchange surface. Thick walls would create a long diffusion distance, slowing down the rate of gas transfer. A small surface area would severely limit the total amount of gas that could be exchanged at any one time. An animal with such a respiratory surface would be unable to obtain enough oxygen or remove enough carbon dioxide to support its metabolic activities.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nAlthough having thin walls is a crucial adaptation for a gas exchange surface as it provides a short diffusion pathway for rapid gas movement, a small surface area would be a limiting factor. A small surface area would not provide enough space for the required volume of gas to be exchanged to meet the animal's metabolic needs, even if the diffusion across that small area was rapid.

This genetic consistency is due to the individuals being **homozygous** for the alleles controlling that trait.\n\nAn individual is homozygous when it has two identical alleles for a particular gene. This can be either homozygous dominant (e.g., GG) or homozygous recessive (e.g., gg).\n\n*   If two homozygous dominant individuals are bred (GG x GG), all possible offspring will have the genotype GG and will express the dominant phenotype.\n*   If two homozygous recessive individuals are bred (gg x gg), all possible offspring will have the genotype gg and will express the recessive phenotype.\n\nIn both scenarios, the offspring are uniform and identical to the parents for that characteristic, which is the definition of pure-breeding. Therefore, breeding two homozygous individuals ensures a pure-breeding cross.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. a heterozygous and a homozygous individual**\n\nThis pairing does not represent a pure-breeding cross because one of the parents is heterozygous. A heterozygous individual (e.g., Gg) carries two different alleles for a trait and does not breed true. When crossed with a homozygous individual, the offspring will not be genetically uniform.\n\n*   **Case 1: Heterozygous x Homozygous recessive (Gg x gg)**. The offspring will have two different genotypes (Gg and gg) and two different phenotypes (dominant and recessive) in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Case 2: Heterozygous x Homozygous dominant (Gg x GG)**. The offspring will have two different genotypes (GG and Gg), although they will all display the same dominant phenotype.\n\nSince the offspring genotypes are not uniform in either case, this pair is not pure-breeding.\n\n**B. two heterozygous individuals**\n\nA cross between two heterozygous individuals (e.g., Gg x Gg) is a classic monohybrid cross and is the opposite of pure-breeding. Such a cross results in genetic and phenotypic variation among the offspring. The resulting genotypes are typically in a 1:2:1 ratio (GG:Gg:gg), and the phenotypes are in a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive). The lack of uniformity in the offspring demonstrates that the heterozygous parents do not breed true.\n\n**D. two individuals with the same phenotype**\n\nPhenotype is the observable characteristic, which does not always reveal the underlying genetic makeup (genotype). While individuals with the same recessive phenotype must both be homozygous recessive (e.g., gg) and would therefore be pure-breeding, individuals with the same dominant phenotype can be either homozygous dominant (GG) or heterozygous (Gg).\n\nIf two individuals with the dominant phenotype are crossed, they could both be heterozygous (Gg x Gg). As explained above, this cross produces offspring with different phenotypes and genotypes, so it is not pure-breeding. Because having the same phenotype does not guarantee a homozygous genotype, it does not guarantee a pure-breeding pair."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_114.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "34 ina pea plant, the allele for round seeds, r, is dominant to the allele for wrinkled seeds, r.\nif plants with the genotype rr are crossed, what are the likely proportions of offspring?\na all with round seeds\nb all with wrinkled seeds\nc1 with round seeds: 1 with wrinkled seeds\nd  3.with round seeds: 1 with wrinkled seeds", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA cross between two heterozygous pea plants (`Rr x Rr`) results in a predictable ratio of phenotypes in the offspring. To determine this ratio, we can use a Punnett square.\n\n1.  **Parental Genotypes:** Both parents are heterozygous, with the genotype `Rr`.\n2.  **Gametes:** During meiosis, the alleles for a gene segregate. Each parent will produce two types of gametes in equal proportions: 50% will carry the dominant allele (`R`) and 50% will carry the recessive allele (`r`).\n3.  **Punnett Square:** This tool helps visualize the possible combinations of these gametes at fertilization.\n\n| | **R** | **r** |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **R** | RR | Rr |\n| **r** | Rr | rr |\n\n4.  **Offspring Genotypes and Phenotypes:**\n    *   **RR (1/4):** Homozygous dominant, resulting in a round seed phenotype.\n    *   **Rr (2/4 or 1/2):** Heterozygous, also resulting in a round seed phenotype because the dominant allele `R` masks the effect of the recessive allele `r`.\n    *   **rr (1/4):** Homozygous recessive, resulting in a wrinkled seed phenotype.\n\n5.  **Phenotypic Ratio:** By adding the proportions for each phenotype, we find that 3/4 of the offspring (the RR and Rr genotypes) will have round seeds, and 1/4 of the offspring (the rr genotype) will have wrinkled seeds. This gives a phenotypic ratio of 3 with round seeds : 1 with wrinkled seeds.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: all with round seeds**\nThis outcome would occur if all offspring inherit at least one dominant `R` allele. While a cross between a homozygous dominant (`RR`) and a heterozygous (`Rr`) plant would produce all round-seeded offspring, a cross between two heterozygous (`Rr`) parents has a 25% probability of producing homozygous recessive (`rr`) offspring. These `rr` offspring will exhibit the wrinkled seed phenotype.\n\n**B: all with wrinkled seeds**\nThis outcome is only possible if all offspring have the homozygous recessive genotype (`rr`). This would require both parent plants to be homozygous recessive (`rr x rr`), as neither would possess the dominant `R` allele to pass on. The parents in this cross are heterozygous (`Rr`), so they can produce offspring with genotypes `RR` and `Rr`, both of which result in round seeds.\n\n**C: 1 with round seeds : 1 with wrinkled seeds**\nA 1:1 phenotypic ratio is characteristic of a cross between a heterozygous individual (`Rr`) and a homozygous recessive individual (`rr`), often called a test cross. In such a cross, half the offspring would be `Rr` (round) and half would be `rr` (wrinkled). However, the cross described in the problem is between two heterozygous (`Rr`) individuals, which yields a different ratio."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_115.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "35 which definition of continuous variation is correct?\na variation that results in a limited number of phenotypes between two extremes\nb variation that results in a limited number of phenotypes with no intermediates\nc variation that results in a range of phenotypes between two extremes\nd variation that results in a range of phenotypes with no intermediates", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nContinuous variation is a type of genetic variation where a particular characteristic exhibits a complete spectrum of phenotypes from one extreme to another. There are no distinct categories; instead, there are many intermediate forms. For example, human height does not fall into simple categories like 'short' and 'tall' but exists as a continuous range of possible measurements. This type of variation is typically controlled by multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) and is often significantly influenced by environmental factors. Option C accurately describes this as a \"range of phenotypes between two extremes.\"\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: variation that results in a limited number of phenotypes between two extremes**\nThis definition is incorrect because the term \"limited number of phenotypes\" contradicts the nature of continuous variation. Continuous variation involves a vast, non-limited number of possible intermediate phenotypes, creating a smooth gradient. A limited number of phenotypes is a characteristic of discontinuous variation.\n\n**B: variation that results in a limited number of phenotypes with no intermediates**\nThis statement accurately defines discontinuous (or discrete) variation, not continuous variation. In discontinuous variation, individuals fall into distinct, separate categories with no in-between forms. Examples include human blood groups (A, B, AB, O) or the ability to roll one's tongue.\n\n**D: variation that results in a range of phenotypes with no intermediates**\nThis statement is internally contradictory.

This energy is captured by producers, which are typically photosynthetic organisms like plants or algae, at the base of the food chain. Through the process of photosynthesis, these producers convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy. This chemical energy is stored in the bonds of organic molecules, such as glucose. This stored energy is then transferred from one trophic level to the next as organisms are consumed. Therefore, the sun's energy is the initial input that powers the entire ecosystem.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. carbon dioxide gas**\nCarbon dioxide is a crucial raw material for photosynthesis, but it is not a source of energy. It provides the carbon atoms that producers use to build organic molecules. The energy required to convert low-energy carbon dioxide into energy-rich organic compounds like glucose comes from sunlight.\n\n**B. glucose**\nGlucose is a chemical store of energy, not the principal source.

In nearly all terrestrial ecosystems, the biomass decreases at each successive trophic level. This is because only about 10% of the energy (and thus biomass) from one level is incorporated into the next.\n\n1.  **Producers (Bottom Level):** The single tree, despite being one organism, has a very large total biomass due to its trunk, branches, leaves, and roots.

This shape is often representative of a **pyramid of numbers** for this specific food chain (one tree supporting many caterpillars). However, it is incorrect for a **pyramid of biomass**. The total dry mass (biomass) of a single large tree is far greater than the combined biomass of the caterpillars feeding on it. A pyramid of biomass for this food chain must have the largest bar at the bottom representing the producer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis diagram shows an inverted pyramid, where biomass increases at each successive trophic level. This is ecologically unsustainable in a terrestrial ecosystem. It would imply that the biomass of consumers is greater than the biomass of the organisms they feed on, which violates the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of energy transfer in food chains. A significant amount of energy and biomass is lost at each trophic transfer, meaning the biomass must decrease as you move up the food chain.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis diagram shows an inconsistent pattern of biomass distribution. While it correctly shows that the biomass of primary and secondary consumers is less than the producer, it incorrectly suggests that the biomass of the tertiary consumers (the bird of prey) is larger than the secondary consumers (the small birds).

Under optimal conditions of temperature, pH, and nutrient availability, many bacterial species can double their population in as little as 20 minutes. This exponential growth rate means that a small number of bacteria can quickly multiply into a very large population. In industrial manufacturing, where bacteria are used to produce substances like insulin, enzymes, or antibiotics, this rapid reproduction allows for the generation of large quantities of the desired product in a short period, making the process highly efficient and economically viable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Bacteria can be grown without nutrients.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Like all living organisms, bacteria require a source of nutrients to provide energy and the raw materials for growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

A value of 2.6 is ten times smaller than the correct answer and does not follow from the correct application of the magnification formula to the given values.\n\n**B. 19.5 mm**\nThis answer is incorrect as it cannot be derived from the provided data using the correct scientific formula for magnification. The calculation for actual size requires dividing the image size (65 mm) by the magnification (2.5), which results in 26 mm, not 19.5 mm.\n\n**D. 195 mm**\nThis answer is incorrect. It is larger than the measured image size (65 mm), which is not possible when determining the actual size of a magnified object. This error typically arises from incorrectly multiplying the image size by the magnification factor instead of dividing. The purpose of magnification is to make a small object appear larger, so the actual size must be smaller than the magnified image size."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_126.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "6 by which process does oxygen pass out of a leaf?\na diffusion\nb_ osmosis\nc_ egestion\nd transpiration", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A. diffusion\n\nDuring photosynthesis, which occurs in the mesophyll cells of a leaf, oxygen is produced as a by-product. This leads to a higher concentration of oxygen molecules in the air spaces within the leaf compared to the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere outside the leaf. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. Consequently, oxygen moves from the air spaces inside the leaf, through the stomata, and into the surrounding air via diffusion. This is a passive process that does not require energy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B. osmosis\n\nOsmosis is a specialised form of diffusion that specifically describes the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. The movement is from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. The process in question concerns the movement of oxygen gas, not water molecules. Therefore, osmosis is not the correct process to describe how oxygen passes out of a leaf.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C. egestion\n\nEgestion is the biological process of discharging undigested or waste material from a cell or an organism. In animals, this typically refers to the elimination of faeces from the digestive tract. Plants do not have a digestive system in this sense and do not undergo egestion. The release of a gaseous by-product like oxygen is part of gas exchange, a fundamentally different physiological process.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D. transpiration\n\nTranspiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves. It is specifically the loss of water vapour from the leaf to the atmosphere, primarily through the stomata. While both transpiration (water vapour loss) and oxygen release occur through the stomata, the term transpiration exclusively refers to the movement of water.

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.\n\n1.  **Pure water:** Pure water has the highest possible water potential. The potato cells contain solutes (sugars, salts), giving them a lower water potential. Therefore, water will move by osmosis from the pure water into the potato cells, causing them to swell and become turgid. This will lead to an overall increase in the length of the potato piece.\n2.  **A sugar solution less concentrated than the potato cells:** This solution has a higher water potential than the potato cells, but lower than pure water. Water will still move by osmosis from the solution into the potato cells, causing them to swell and the potato piece to increase in length.\n3.  **A sugar solution more concentrated than the potato cells:** This solution has a lower water potential than the potato cells. Water will move by osmosis out of the potato cells and into the surrounding solution. The cells will lose water, become flaccid, and shrink. This will cause the potato piece to decrease in length.\n\nSince conditions 1, 2, and 3 all create a water potential gradient between the solution and the potato cells, they will all result in a net movement of water and a subsequent change in the length of the potato piece.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 1, 2, 3 and 4**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes solution 4. In solution 4, the concentration of the sugar solution is the same as the concentration of the potato cell contents. This means the solution is isotonic to the cells; the water potential inside the potato cells is equal to the water potential of the surrounding solution. Consequently, there is no net movement of water by osmosis. As the cells neither gain nor lose a significant amount of water, their volume remains constant, and the length of the potato piece does not change.\n\n**C. 1 and 4 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it incorrectly includes solution 4, in which no change in length occurs because the solution is isotonic to the potato cells, resulting in no net water movement. Secondly, it incorrectly excludes solutions 2 and 3. Both of these solutions have water potentials different from that of the potato cells, which establishes a water potential gradient and causes a net movement of water by osmosis, leading to a change in the length of the potato piece.\n\n**D. 2 and 3 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes solution 1. Pure water has the highest possible water potential, creating a significant water potential gradient between the water and the potato cells. This causes a net movement of water into the cells, making them turgid and causing the potato piece to increase in length.

Under these conditions, the plant will carry out photosynthesis at a high rate. Photosynthesis is the process that uses light energy, water, and carbon dioxide to create glucose (for energy) and oxygen as a by-product. Although the plant also respires (a process that consumes oxygen), in bright sunlight, the rate of photosynthesis is significantly greater than the rate of respiration. This leads to a net production of oxygen, causing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water to increase substantially. As there are no other organisms consuming this oxygen, the accumulation will be the highest in this test-tube.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis test-tube contains an aquatic animal. The animal will carry out aerobic respiration, a process that consumes oxygen to release energy from food. As a result, the dissolved oxygen in the water will be used up by the animal, leading to a decrease in the overall oxygen concentration in the test-tube over time.

Oxygen and glucose are produced.**\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use light energy to synthesise foods from carbon dioxide and water. The overall balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n**6CO\u2082 (Carbon dioxide) + 6H\u2082O (Water) \u2192 (in the presence of light and chlorophyll) \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 (Glucose) + 6O\u2082 (Oxygen)**\n\nFrom this equation, it is clear that the main products of the reaction are glucose and oxygen. Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary energy source for the plant.

Carbon dioxide and glucose are the raw materials.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While carbon dioxide is indeed a raw material (a reactant) for photosynthesis, glucose is a product of the process. Raw materials are the substances consumed during a chemical reaction, not the substances created. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to build glucose molecules.\n\n**B. Carbon dioxide and glucose are produced.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because carbon dioxide is a raw material (reactant), not a product, of photosynthesis. Plants consume carbon dioxide from the environment to carry out photosynthesis. Glucose is a product, but since the statement also incorrectly identifies carbon dioxide as a product, the entire statement is false.\n\n**D. Oxygen and glucose are the raw materials.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It describes the reactants of aerobic cellular respiration, not photosynthesis.

Through the process of cellular respiration, these large organic molecules are catabolised into smaller units. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars like glucose, which is the body's preferred source of energy. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. Both glucose and the products of fat breakdown enter metabolic pathways where their chemical bonds are broken, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy is captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which powers all cellular activities, from muscle contraction to nerve impulse transmission.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**B. carbohydrate and mineral ions**\nWhile carbohydrates are a primary source of energy, mineral ions are not. Mineral ions are inorganic elements, such as calcium, iron, and potassium, that are essential for various physiological functions. For example, calcium is crucial for bone structure and muscle function, and iron is a key component of haemoglobin in red blood cells.

However, water does not contain chemical energy that can be released by breaking it down. Proteins are primarily used for growth, repair, and the synthesis of enzymes and hormones. While proteins can be broken down to release energy, this typically only occurs when carbohydrate and fat reserves are depleted. Since water provides no energy, this combination is incorrect.\n\n**D. vitamins and protein**\nVitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts to maintain health. They often function as coenzymes, which are molecules that assist enzymes in catalysing metabolic reactions, including those involved in energy release from carbohydrates and fats. However, vitamins themselves are not broken down to provide energy.

This involves two main physical processes. First, water that has been transported to the leaves via the xylem moves into the spongy mesophyll cells. This water then forms a thin film on the surface of these cells. Energy from the sun causes this liquid water to **evaporate** from the surfaces of the mesophyll cells into the air spaces within the leaf, turning into water vapour. This increases the concentration of water vapour inside the leaf.\n\nSecondly, a water vapour concentration gradient is established between the moist air spaces inside the leaf and the typically drier air outside the leaf. As a result, water vapour moves from this area of high concentration (inside the leaf) to the area of lower concentration (outside the leaf). This movement of water vapour molecules down a concentration gradient and out through the stomatal pores is known as **diffusion**. Therefore, transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the surface of mesophyll cells, followed by the diffusion of water vapour through the stomata.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: absorption of water / evaporation of water**\nThis option is incorrect. While mesophyll cells do absorb water from the xylem, the process that leads to water loss at their surface is evaporation (change from liquid to gas), not absorption. Furthermore, evaporation does not occur *through* the stomata; rather, water vapour *diffuses* through them. Evaporation happens on the surfaces of the mesophyll cells inside the leaf.\n\n**B: absorption of water / diffusion of water vapour**\nThis option is incorrect because the process at the surface of the mesophyll cells that contributes to transpiration is evaporation, not absorption. Although the diffusion of water vapour through the stomata is correctly identified, the first part of the pairing is wrong. Absorption of water by mesophyll cells is a preceding step, but not the direct cause of water turning into vapour.\n\n**C: diffusion of water vapour / evaporation of water**\nThis option incorrectly reverses the processes. The change of state from liquid water to water vapour, which is **evaporation**, occurs first on the surface of the mesophyll cells. **Diffusion** is the subsequent movement of this water vapour out of the leaf through the stomata.

This journey involves three main types of blood vessels, each with a distinct structure related to its function.\n\n1.  **Artery (Vessel 1):** Blood leaving the heart via the aorta is at high pressure. It flows into arteries, which are characterized by thick, muscular, and elastic walls and a relatively narrow lumen. This structure allows arteries to withstand and maintain high blood pressure, propelling blood forward. Vessel 1 shows these features.\n2.  **Capillary (Vessel 3):** Arteries branch into much smaller vessels called capillaries. Capillaries have walls that are only one cell thick. This extremely thin wall provides a short diffusion distance, facilitating the efficient exchange of substances like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's tissues. Vessel 3 depicts this single-cell-thick wall.\n3.  **Vein (Vessel 2):** After passing through the capillary networks, blood is collected into veins to be returned to the heart. By this point, blood pressure is much lower. Veins have thinner, less muscular walls and a large lumen compared to arteries. The large lumen reduces resistance to blood flow, and the thinner walls are sufficient for the lower pressure. Vessel 2 has a relatively thin wall and a wide lumen, which is characteristic of a vein.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence for blood flow from the aorta to the right atrium is Artery \u2192 Capillary \u2192 Vein, which corresponds to the sequence 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 2.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3**\nThis sequence suggests that blood flows from an artery (1) to a vein (2) and then to a capillary (3). This is incorrect because capillaries are the microscopic vessels that form the link between the arterial and venous systems. Gas and nutrient exchange occurs in the capillaries, which must therefore be situated between the arteries and veins.\n\n**C: 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 1**\nThis sequence suggests that blood flows from a vein (2) to a capillary (3) and then to an artery (1). This represents the reverse of the correct pathway in systemic circulation. Blood is carried away from the heart in arteries and returns to the heart in veins. The journey from the aorta (the main artery) must begin with an artery, not a vein.\n\n**D: 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2**\nThis sequence suggests that blood flows from a capillary (3) to an artery (1) and then to a vein (2). This is incorrect because arteries are large vessels that branch into smaller arterioles, which in turn feed into capillary beds. Blood cannot flow from a tiny capillary into a larger, high-pressure artery. The flow is always from larger arteries to smaller capillaries."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_141.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 in some animals, gas exchange occurs through the skin.\nwhat are the most likely characteristics of the skin in these animals?\n[| surce rea [skin | biod supp\na large thick poor\nb large thin good\ncc small thick poor\nd small thin good", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nFor gas exchange to occur efficiently through the skin (cutaneous respiration), several key features are required. Firstly, a **large surface area** is necessary to maximize the rate of diffusion, allowing a sufficient volume of gases to be exchanged per unit of time. Secondly, the skin must be **thin**. This creates a short diffusion pathway for gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide to travel between the external environment and the animal's circulatory system, increasing the speed and efficiency of exchange. Finally, a **good blood supply**, consisting of a dense network of capillaries just beneath the skin's surface, is essential. This maintains a steep concentration gradient by rapidly transporting oxygen away from the skin and bringing carbon dioxide to it, ensuring that diffusion continues at a high rate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While a large surface area is beneficial for gas exchange, thick skin would create a long diffusion pathway, significantly slowing down the rate at which gases can move across it. Furthermore, a poor blood supply would fail to maintain the steep concentration gradient required for efficient diffusion, as gases would not be transported away from (or to) the skin surface quickly enough.\n\n**C:** All three characteristics listed in this option are unsuitable for efficient gas exchange. A small surface area would severely limit the total amount of gas that could be exchanged. Thick skin would create a long, inefficient diffusion pathway. A poor blood supply would prevent the maintenance of a concentration gradient, causing gas exchange to slow or stop.\n\n**D:** Although thin skin and a good blood supply are ideal features for gas exchange, a small surface area would be a major limiting factor.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\n*   **Movement of Oxygen:** Air inhaled into the alveoli has a high concentration of oxygen. The blood arriving at the lungs in the capillaries has a low concentration of oxygen because it has been used by the body's cells for respiration. This difference in concentration creates a steep concentration gradient, causing oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli into the red blood cells within the capillaries. Arrow 2 correctly illustrates this movement.\n\n*   **Movement of Carbon Dioxide:** The blood arriving at the lungs from the body tissues has a high concentration of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. The air within the alveoli has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide. This concentration gradient causes carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood plasma and red blood cells into the alveoli, from where it is removed from the body during exhalation.

It is consumed by the yeast cell at the start of the metabolic pathway. It is not a substance that is formed or released at the end of the process; therefore, it is not a product of anaerobic respiration.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe term 'anaerobic' specifically means that the process occurs in the absence of oxygen.

It is composed of a very long molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is tightly coiled and wrapped around structural proteins called histones. This efficient packaging allows the vast amount of genetic information to fit inside the nucleus. Therefore, the fundamental building block of a chromosome is DNA.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) Chromosomes make up a gene.**\nThis statement reverses the correct biological hierarchy. A gene is a specific segment or sequence of DNA that provides the instructions for making a particular protein or functional RNA molecule. Genes are located at specific positions (loci) along the length of a chromosome. A single chromosome contains hundreds or even thousands of genes. Therefore, genes are components of a chromosome, not the other way around.\n\n**C) Each chromosome is a length of DNA that codes for a protein.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes a chromosome. The definition provided\u2014\"a length of DNA that codes for a protein\"\u2014is the definition of a gene. A chromosome is a much larger and more complex structure. It consists of a long DNA molecule that contains many different genes, as well as large regions of non-coding DNA which have roles in regulation and chromosome structure. An entire chromosome does not code for a single protein.\n\n**D) Different forms of chromosomes are called alleles.**\nThis statement incorrectly defines alleles. An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of a *gene* that arise by mutation and are found at the same place (locus) on a chromosome. For example, the gene for blood type in humans has three different alleles: I\u1d2c, I\u1d2e, and i.

For an individual to express the dominant phenotype (black fur), its genotype can be either homozygous dominant (BB) or heterozygous (Bb). For an individual to express the recessive phenotype (brown fur), its genotype must be homozygous recessive (bb).\n\nThe problem states that two parents with black fur produce an offspring with brown fur. An offspring with brown fur must have the genotype **bb**. To have this genotype, the offspring must inherit one recessive allele ('b') from each parent. Therefore, both parents must carry the recessive 'b' allele.\n\nSince both parents also have black fur, they must each possess at least one dominant 'B' allele. The only genotype that satisfies both conditions \u2013 having the dominant phenotype (black fur) and carrying the recessive allele ('b') \u2013 is the heterozygous genotype, **Bb**. Consequently, both parents must be heterozygous. A Punnett square for a Bb x Bb cross confirms that there is a 25% probability of producing a bb offspring.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Only one of the parents is heterozygous.**\nIf only one parent were heterozygous (Bb), the other parent, also having black fur, would have to be homozygous dominant (BB). A cross between a heterozygous parent (Bb) and a homozygous dominant parent (BB) would result in offspring with genotypes BB and Bb. All of these offspring would express the dominant phenotype (black fur). It is genetically impossible for this pairing to produce an offspring with the homozygous recessive genotype (bb), and thus brown fur.\n\n**C: Both parents are homozygous.**\nIf both parents were homozygous and had black fur, their genotype would have to be homozygous dominant (BB). A cross between two homozygous dominant parents (BB x BB) would produce only homozygous dominant offspring (BB). All offspring would have black fur. This pairing could never produce an offspring with brown fur (bb).\n\n**D: Only one of the parents is homozygous.**\nThis statement is logically equivalent to option B.

There are no intermediate forms. The ABO blood group system is a prime example of discontinuous variation in humans. An individual's blood type is either A, B, AB, or O. It is impossible to have a blood type that is intermediate between these distinct groups. This type of variation is typically controlled by one or a small number of genes and is not influenced by environmental factors. In this case, the ABO blood group is determined by a single gene with three alleles.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) body mass**\n\nBody mass is an example of continuous variation. This means it does not fall into distinct categories but shows a complete range of values from one extreme to another. For example, an individual can have a body mass of 60 kg, 60.5 kg, 61 kg, and so on, forming a continuous spectrum. Continuous variation is typically controlled by multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors, such as diet and exercise.\n\n**B) height**\n\nHeight is a classic example of continuous variation. In a population, individuals are not just 'short' or 'tall'; their heights span a continuous range of values. If the heights of a large sample of people are measured and plotted on a graph, they typically form a normal distribution or bell-shaped curve, which is characteristic of continuous variation. Height is a polygenic trait, meaning it is influenced by many genes, and it is also affected by environmental factors like nutrition during childhood and adolescence.\n\n**D) width of hand**\n\nThe width of the hand is another characteristic that exhibits continuous variation. Similar to height and body mass, hand width can be measured and will show a range of values across a population, with no separate, distinct categories. This quantitative trait is influenced by the combined action of multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) and can also be affected by environmental factors during an individual's growth and development."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_156.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "36 where does the energy being transferred along a food chain originally come from?\na producer\nb photosynthesis\nc_ carbon dioxide\nd the sun", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe ultimate source of energy for almost all food chains on Earth is the Sun.

This trend is caused by activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or reduce the Earth's capacity to remove it.\n\n1.  **Burning fossil fuels:** Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are carbon-rich remains of ancient organisms. When they are burned for energy (combustion), the stored carbon combines with oxygen from the air to form carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), which is released in large quantities into the atmosphere. This is a primary driver of the increase shown in the graph.\n\n2.  **Deforestation:** Forests act as significant 'carbon sinks', as trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis. Deforestation, the large-scale clearing of forests, has a twofold effect: it reduces the number of trees available to remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, and the cleared trees are often burned or left to decompose, which releases the carbon they had stored back into the atmosphere as CO\u2082.\n\nBoth burning fossil fuels and deforestation contribute to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, making this the correct choice.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: 1, 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes replanting forests (activity 3). Replanting forests, or afforestation, increases the number of trees that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Therefore, replanting forests would help to decrease or slow the rate of increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, counteracting the trend shown in the graph, not causing it.\n\n**C: 1 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it is incomplete. While burning fossil fuels (activity 1) is a major cause of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, deforestation (activity 2) is also a significant contributing factor. Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO\u2082 and also releases stored carbon. Since both activities 1 and 2 contribute to the observed increase, excluding deforestation makes this option insufficient.\n\n**D: 2 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes replanting forests (activity 3) and excludes burning fossil fuels (activity 1). As explained above, replanting forests removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and would not cause the increase shown.

Through genetic engineering, a gene from another organism that codes for a useful protein (a complex molecule) can be inserted into a bacterial plasmid. The bacterium then transcribes and translates this foreign gene, producing large quantities of the desired molecule. This process is fundamental to the industrial production of substances like human insulin, hormones, vaccines, and enzymes.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** While it is true that many species of bacteria are found inside the human body, such as in the gut, this is not the reason they are used in biotechnology. The utility of bacteria in this field is based on their biological characteristics\u2014such as their simple genetic structure, rapid growth, and metabolic capabilities\u2014not their natural habitat. Many bacteria used in industrial processes are sourced from the environment, not the human body.\n\n**B:** This statement is factually incorrect. Bacteria are well-known for their ability to develop resistance to antibiotics through processes like mutation and horizontal gene transfer. The evolution of antibiotic resistance is a major concern in medicine. In biotechnology, this characteristic is often exploited; genes for antibiotic resistance are used as \"marker genes\" to easily identify and select bacteria that have been successfully genetically modified.\n\n**D:** This statement is the opposite of the truth. One of the main advantages of using bacteria in biotechnology is their extremely rapid rate of reproduction.

This means that not only can they reproduce with each other, but their young must also be able to reproduce. The ability to produce fertile offspring indicates that the parent organisms share a common gene pool and are reproductively isolated from other groups of organisms. For example, a horse and a donkey can reproduce, but their offspring, a mule, is sterile and cannot produce its own offspring. This demonstrates that horses and donkeys are distinct species.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** The concept of a species, particularly the Biological Species Concept, is primarily based on the capacity for interbreeding (sexual reproduction). While some organisms reproduce asexually, this mode of reproduction does not define a species.

This statement is too narrow as it excludes all non-vertebrate organisms (like invertebrates, plants, and fungi).

By binding to them, tetracycline blocks the process, preventing the bacterium from producing essential proteins needed for its survival and replication. This directly corresponds to the observed effect \"stops protein synthesis\".\n\nTherefore, penicillin affects the cell wall, and tetracycline affects the ribosomes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Penicillin affects the nucleus and tetracycline affects the cytoplasm.**\nThis is incorrect. Bacteria are prokaryotic cells and do not possess a true, membrane-bound nucleus. Furthermore, an attack on the genetic material would not directly cause the cell to burst. While tetracycline acts within the cytoplasm, its specific target is the ribosome, not the cytoplasm in general.\n\n**C: Penicillin affects the ribosomes and tetracycline affects the cell wall.**\nThis statement reverses the known mechanisms of these two antibiotics. An antibiotic that affects ribosomes would halt protein synthesis, not cause the cell to burst. Conversely, an antibiotic that affects the cell wall would cause lysis, not stop protein synthesis.\n\n**D: Penicillin affects the vacuole and tetracycline affects the nucleus.**\nThis is incorrect. Bacterial cells do not contain large, membrane-bound vacuoles, which are characteristic of plant cells. As prokaryotes, they also lack a true nucleus.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient, so a larger difference in concentration results in a faster rate of movement.\n2.  **A large surface area:** A larger surface area of the cell membrane provides more space for ions to cross, thereby increasing the overall rate of diffusion.\n3.  **A short diffusion distance:** A thin cell membrane reduces the distance that ions must travel to enter the cell, which speeds up the process.\n\nRow D presents all of these optimal conditions: a low internal ion concentration, a high external ion concentration, a large cell surface area, and a thin cell membrane.

Their primary function is to increase the rate of biochemical reactions within living organisms. They achieve this by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed. By providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy barrier, enzymes allow metabolic processes, such as digestion and respiration, to occur at a speed sufficient to sustain life. Enzymes themselves are not consumed or permanently altered during the reaction and can be reused.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The pH has no effect on the rate of reaction.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The activity of an enzyme is highly sensitive to pH. Each enzyme has an optimal pH at which it functions most efficiently. Deviations from this optimal pH can alter the ionic charges of the amino acids in the enzyme's active site. This disrupts the specific three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, particularly the active site, hindering its ability to bind to its substrate. Extreme changes in pH can cause the enzyme to denature, which is an irreversible loss of its functional shape, thereby permanently stopping its catalytic activity. For example, pepsin in the stomach functions best at a highly acidic pH of around 2, whereas trypsin in the small intestine has an optimal pH of about 8.\n\n**B. They are denatured at low temperatures.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Low temperatures do not cause denaturation. Instead, they decrease the kinetic energy of both the enzyme and substrate molecules. This reduction in molecular motion leads to fewer collisions between the enzyme's active site and the substrate, thereby slowing down the rate of the reaction. At very low temperatures, the enzyme becomes inactive, but this effect is reversible. If the temperature is raised back to the optimum level, the enzyme will regain its shape and function. Denaturation is an irreversible change in the enzyme's three-dimensional structure, which is typically caused by high temperatures or extreme pH.\n\n**C. They are made of carbohydrates which have specific shapes.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Enzymes are proteins, not carbohydrates. Proteins are complex polymers composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The specific sequence of these amino acids determines how the polypeptide chain folds into a unique and precise three-dimensional tertiary structure. This specific shape, which includes the active site, is essential for the enzyme's ability to bind to its specific substrate and catalyse a reaction.

Enzymes are highly specific biological catalysts, and their function relies on their three-dimensional structure. The active site is a particular region on the enzyme's surface with a unique shape and chemical environment. This shape is precisely complementary to the shape of the substrate molecule it acts upon, similar to how a lock is specific to its key. This specific binding forms an enzyme-substrate complex, which is essential for the enzyme to catalyse the reaction efficiently.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **A. The shape of the enzyme's active site is complementary to all proteins.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Enzyme action is highly specific. An enzyme's active site is complementary only to its specific substrate, not to all proteins or any other type of molecule. If an enzyme could bind to any protein, it would lead to non-specific and uncontrolled reactions within the cell, disrupting metabolic pathways.\n\n*   **C. The shape of the substrate's active site is complementary to the product.**\n    This statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, substrates do not have active sites; the active site is a part of the enzyme. Secondly, the enzyme's active site is complementary to the substrate, not the product. Once the substrate binds and the reaction occurs, it is converted into the product(s), which have a different shape. This change in shape causes the product to be released from the active site, freeing the enzyme to catalyse another reaction.\n\n*   **D. The shape of the substrate's active site is complementary to the enzyme.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect because substrates do not have active sites.

By changing their shape based on turgor pressure, they control the opening and closing of the stomata. This action directly regulates the exchange of gases between the leaf's internal air spaces and the atmosphere.

These cells form a single, transparent layer on the surface of the leaf, which allows sunlight to pass through to the photosynthetic cells below. Their primary function is protection, and they are typically covered by a waxy, waterproof cuticle that minimises water loss. Epidermal cells do not regulate gas exchange; they form a barrier.

The chemical structure of a chlorophyll molecule is complex, consisting of a porphyrin ring. At the very centre of this ring structure is a single magnesium ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a). This ion is a crucial structural component of the molecule. Plants absorb magnesium ions from the soil through their roots, and these ions are then transported to the leaves where they are incorporated into new chlorophyll molecules. A deficiency of magnesium in the soil prevents the plant from synthesising enough chlorophyll, leading to a condition called chlorosis, where the leaves turn yellow.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. calcium**\nCalcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a) are essential for plant growth, but they are not used to make chlorophyll. The primary roles of calcium in plants include strengthening the cell walls by forming calcium pectate in the middle lamella, and functioning in cell membrane stability and as a signalling molecule.

When the food reaches the stomach, the highly acidic environment (low pH) denatures the salivary amylase, halting its activity. The stomach does not produce any carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. Therefore, no chemical digestion of starch occurs in the stomach. Digestion resumes in the small intestine, where pancreatic amylase continues to break down starch into maltose, and other enzymes (e.g., maltase) on the surface of the intestinal cells complete the breakdown into glucose, which can then be absorbed. This digestive pathway matches the conditions described: digestion in the mouth and small intestine, but not in the stomach.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A fat**\nThe significant chemical digestion of fats (lipids) does not begin in the mouth. The primary site for fat digestion is the small intestine. Here, bile from the liver emulsifies large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for the enzyme lipase (primarily from the pancreas) to break them down into fatty acids and glycerol. While some minor fat digestion by lingual and gastric lipases can occur, the major process does not start in the mouth, making this option incorrect.\n\n**B ions**\nIons are simple, inorganic particles (e.g., sodium, chloride) that are already in their smallest form. Chemical digestion is the enzymatic breakdown of large, complex food molecules (like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) into smaller, absorbable units. Since ions do not require breaking down, they do not undergo chemical digestion. They are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, primarily in the small intestine.\n\n**C protein**\nThe chemical digestion of protein does not occur in the mouth, as saliva lacks protein-digesting enzymes (proteases).

A major component of xylem tissue is the xylem vessels, which are long, hollow tubes formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end, providing an efficient pathway for water movement. Therefore, xylem vessels are always present in a vascular bundle.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. anthers**\nAnthers are part of the stamen, the male reproductive organ of a flower. Their function is to produce and release pollen grains. Anthers are located in the flower and are involved in reproduction, not in the transport of substances through the stem, leaves, or roots. They are not a component of the plant's vascular tissue system.\n\n**B. guard cells**\nGuard cells are specialized cells found in the epidermis of leaves, stems, and other plant organs. They occur in pairs and surround a pore called a stoma (plural: stomata).

Water is first absorbed from the soil into the root hair cells by osmosis. These cells have a large surface area to maximise absorption. From the root hair cells, water moves across the root cortex, from cell to cell, towards the centre of the root. It then enters the xylem, which is the primary water-conducting tissue in plants. The xylem forms a continuous network of vessels that transports water up through the stem to the leaves. Finally, in the leaf, water moves out of the xylem and into the mesophyll cells, where it is used for photosynthesis and eventually evaporates during transpiration. This sequence, `root hair cells \u2192 root cortex \u2192 xylem \u2192 mesophyll`, accurately describes the entire journey.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly describes the final steps of water transport within the leaf. While the initial steps (`root hair cells \u2192 root cortex`) are correct, the sequence `mesophyll \u2192 xylem` is wrong. The xylem is the transport tissue that delivers water *to* the mesophyll cells. Water travels up the plant stem within the xylem and then moves *out* of the xylem into the surrounding mesophyll tissue in the leaf, not the other way around.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, the initial step `root cortex \u2192 root hair cells` is backwards. Water absorption begins at the surface of the root with the root hair cells and then moves inwards to the root cortex. Secondly, the final step `mesophyll \u2192 xylem` is also incorrect. Water is transported by the xylem vessels *to* the mesophyll cells of the leaf.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option incorrectly reverses the initial pathway of water absorption in the root. Water moves from the soil into the root hair cells and then across the root cortex to reach the xylem. The sequence `root cortex \u2192 root hair cells` is biologically incorrect, as it implies water moves from the inner tissues of the root outwards to the surface.

Direct transmission involves the immediate transfer of a pathogen from an infected host to a susceptible host. This occurs through direct physical contact or the exchange of bodily fluids.\n\nContact with contaminated blood is a form of direct transmission because blood is a bodily fluid. When the blood of an infected person comes into contact with the bloodstream or mucous membranes of a susceptible person (for example, through a cut, needle-stick injury, or blood transfusion), pathogens such as HIV or the hepatitis B and C viruses can be transferred directly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. by contact with contaminated air**\n\nThis is a form of indirect transmission, specifically airborne transmission. In this mode, pathogens are not transferred directly from person to person. Instead, they travel through an intermediate medium\u2014the air. Microorganisms are expelled by an infected individual (e.g., through coughing or sneezing) and remain suspended in the air in droplets or dust particles, which are then inhaled by a new host. The air acts as a vehicle, making the transmission indirect.\n\n**C. by contact with contaminated food**\n\nThis describes indirect transmission, specifically vehicle transmission. The pathogen is transferred from a source to a host via a non-living medium, which in this case is food. The food becomes contaminated with pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella* or *E. coli*) and acts as a vehicle to carry them into the body of the person who consumes it. There is no direct contact between the originally infected source and the new host.\n\n**D. by contact with contaminated surfaces**\n\nThis is a form of indirect transmission known as fomite transmission. A fomite is any inanimate object (such as a doorknob, tabletop, or piece of equipment) that can become contaminated with pathogens and serve as a vehicle for their transmission. An infected person contaminates the surface, and a susceptible person later touches that surface and transfers the pathogen to their own body, typically by touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.

The reactants in this process are oxygen, which is inhaled or absorbed from the environment, and glucose, which is obtained from food. These reactants undergo a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and water as waste products, and the release of a significant amount of energy (stored in ATP). Therefore, the correct word equation for aerobic respiration is:\noxygen + glucose \u2192 carbon dioxide + water\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. carbon dioxide + glucose \u2192 oxygen + water**\nThis equation is incorrect because it misrepresents the reactants and products of aerobic respiration. Carbon dioxide is a product released during respiration, not a reactant consumed.

In the context of the eye, the stimulus is the intensity of light. The eye responds to this stimulus by adjusting the size of the pupil. In bright light, the circular muscles of the iris contract and the radial muscles relax, causing the pupil to constrict (become smaller). This reduces the amount of light entering the eye, protecting the light-sensitive retina. In dim light, the radial muscles contract and the circular muscles relax, causing the pupil to dilate (become larger). This allows more light to enter the eye, improving vision in low-light conditions. This stimulus-response mechanism is a classic example of sensitivity.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: growth**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nGrowth is the permanent increase in the size and dry mass of an organism, which is achieved through an increase in cell number, cell size, or both. The change in the size of the pupil is a rapid, temporary, and reversible muscular action. The pupil can dilate and constrict many times without any permanent change to the size or mass of the eye. Therefore, this process is not an example of growth.\n\n**B: movement**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMovement is an action by an organism or part of an organism that leads to a change in position or place. While the muscles of the iris do move to alter the pupil's size, this movement is a component of a larger process. The fundamental characteristic being illustrated is the organism's ability to sense a stimulus (light) and then initiate a response (muscular action). This entire process is defined as sensitivity. Movement is merely the mechanism of the response, not the overarching characteristic itself.\n\n**C: excretion**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nExcretion is the removal from an organism of the waste products of metabolism (chemical reactions in cells, including respiration), toxic materials, and substances in excess of requirements. For example, humans excrete carbon dioxide from the lungs and urea from the kidneys. The adjustment of the pupil's size is a physical response to light levels and does not involve the removal of metabolic waste or any other substances from the body.

It is produced and secreted by the \u03b2-cells located in the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream in response to high blood glucose, for instance, after a meal. Insulin then acts on target cells, primarily in the liver, muscles, and adipose (fat) tissue.

The anthers, which produce pollen, are located inside the flower so that as an insect forages for nectar, its body brushes against them, collecting pollen. The pollen grains themselves are relatively large and have a sticky or spiky surface, which ensures they adhere firmly to the insect's body. The stigma, which is the receptive surface for pollen, is also positioned inside the flower and is typically sticky. This ensures that when a pollen-coated insect visits, pollen is efficiently transferred from the insect to the stigma, leading to pollination.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that the anthers are outside the flower. Anthers that hang outside the flower are a characteristic feature of wind-pollinated plants, where this position facilitates the release of pollen into the wind. For insect pollination, anthers must be located inside the flower to make contact with the visiting insect.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it describes the pollen grains as small and light and the stigma as being outside the flower. Small, light pollen is an adaptation for wind pollination, allowing it to be carried easily by air currents.

In this process, glucose and oxygen are used to produce a large amount of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In sperm cells, numerous mitochondria are concentrated in the middle piece, which is located between the head and the tail. This strategic placement ensures a direct and continuous supply of ATP to the flagellum, providing the necessary energy for the powerful contractions that enable the sperm to swim towards the egg.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer: A the acrosome**\n    The acrosome is a cap-like vesicle located at the tip of the sperm's head. It contains digestive (hydrolytic) enzymes. The function of the acrosome is to release these enzymes to break down the protective outer layers of the egg cell during fertilisation. This allows the sperm nucleus to enter the egg. The acrosome is essential for fertilisation but is not involved in providing energy for movement.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer: B the cell membrane**\n    The cell membrane encloses the entire sperm cell. Its primary function is to control the passage of substances into and out of the cell, a property known as selective permeability. While it is vital for maintaining the cell's internal environment and overall survival, it is not the structure that generates the large amount of energy required for motility.\n\n*   **Incorrect Answer: C the flagellum**\n    The flagellum, or tail, is the long, whip-like structure responsible for the movement of the sperm. It propels the sperm forward through a series of rapid, undulating motions. However, the flagellum is the part of the cell that *uses* energy to create this motion; it does not *provide* the energy.

One of its most common applications is in baking bread. In the low-oxygen conditions of bread dough, yeast performs anaerobic respiration, also known as fermentation. During this process, the yeast breaks down sugars (from the flour) into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are trapped by the gluten in the dough, causing it to rise and giving the bread its light, airy texture.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. aerobic respiration to make biofuels**\nThis statement is incorrect because the production of biofuels, such as bioethanol, relies on the **anaerobic** respiration (fermentation) of yeast. In anaerobic conditions, yeast converts sugars into ethanol (the biofuel) and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen, results in the production of carbon dioxide and water, not ethanol.\n\n**C. aerobic respiration to make alcohol**\nThis statement is incorrect. The production of alcohol (ethanol) by yeast is a result of **anaerobic** respiration (fermentation). When oxygen is available, yeast performs aerobic respiration because it yields more energy (ATP). It only switches to anaerobic respiration and produces alcohol when oxygen levels are low or absent.\n\n**D. anaerobic respiration to make human proteins**\nThis statement is incorrect. While yeast can be genetically modified to produce human proteins (such as insulin), this process is not achieved through anaerobic respiration. The production of proteins is a process called protein synthesis (involving transcription and translation), which uses the yeast's cellular machinery (like ribosomes) to read the inserted human gene.

All three uses listed\u2014hiding from predators, hiding from prey, and warning of toxicity\u2014are valid strategies.\n1.  **Hiding from predators (camouflage/crypsis):** Many animals have fur or feathers that blend in with their natural environment. This makes it difficult for predators to spot them, thereby increasing their chances of avoiding being eaten and surviving. For example, a snowshoe hare's white winter coat camouflages it in the snow.\n2.  **Hiding from prey (aggressive camouflage):** Predators also use colour to survive. By blending in with their surroundings, they can ambush unsuspecting prey more effectively. A successful hunt provides the energy needed for survival and reproduction. For instance, a leopard's spotted coat helps it remain concealed while stalking prey in the dappled light of the savanna.\n3.  **Warning coloration (aposematism):** Some animals have bright, conspicuous colours that advertise their danger, such as being poisonous, venomous, or foul-tasting. Predators learn to associate these colours with a negative experience and avoid attacking such animals. This deterrence significantly enhances the brightly-coloured animal's survival. For example, the vibrant colours of a poison dart frog warn predators of its toxicity.\n\nSince all three are effective survival strategies involving colour, this option is correct.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it wrongly excludes warning coloration as a survival mechanism. While it correctly identifies that colour can be used for camouflage to hide from both predators and prey, the claim that colour is not used to warn animals of poison is false. Aposematism, or warning coloration, is a well-documented and effective defence mechanism. Many species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and insects use bright colours to signal their toxicity or other defences to potential predators. For example, skunks use a striking black-and-white pattern to warn predators of their ability to spray a noxious fluid. By excluding this valid survival strategy, this option provides an incomplete and inaccurate account of how colour aids survival.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect primarily because it denies that colour is used for hiding from predators. This is fundamentally wrong, as camouflage to avoid predation is one of the most widespread and crucial survival strategies in the animal kingdom. The ability to remain undetected by animals that might eat them is a primary factor in the survival of countless species, allowing them to live long enough to reproduce. For example, the mottled brown feathers of a ground-nesting bird like the nightjar provide excellent camouflage against the forest floor, protecting it and its eggs from predators. By excluding this essential use of colour, the option is invalid.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes the use of colour for hiding from prey. For any predatory animal, the ability to obtain food is essential for survival. Many predators rely on aggressive camouflage, using their colouration to blend into the environment and ambush their prey. This strategy increases hunting success, ensuring the predator has enough energy to survive, maintain its territory, and reproduce. For example, a polar bear\u2019s white fur makes it difficult for seals to spot it against the snow and ice. By denying that colour is used as a tool for hunting, this option disregards a critical survival strategy used by numerous predatory species."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_196.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "36 the list shows statements about selection.\n\n1 individuals reproduce and pass on their alleles to the next generation.\n2 genetic variation exists between individuals and many offspring are produced.\n3 individuals struggle for survival and compete for resources.\n4 individuals that are better adapted to the environment survive.\n5 individuals with desirable features are selected by humans.\n\nwhich statements are correct descriptions of natural selection?\n\na 1,2,3and4\n\nb 1,2 and 5 only\n\nc 2,3 and 4 only\n\nd 3,4 and 5 only", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nNatural selection is the primary mechanism of evolution, describing how populations of organisms adapt and change over generations. This process is correctly described by statements 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n1.  **Heredity:** Individuals that survive and reproduce pass their genetic material (alleles) to their offspring. This is essential for the advantageous traits to be propagated within the population.\n2.  **Variation and Overproduction:** Within any population, there is natural genetic variation. Furthermore, organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive, given the limitations of the environment.\n3.  **Competition:** The overproduction of offspring leads to a 'struggle for existence', where individuals must compete for limited resources such as food, water, and mates.\n4.  **Differential Survival and Reproduction:** Due to genetic variation, some individuals possess traits that make them better adapted to their environment. These individuals are more likely to survive the struggle for existence, reproduce, and pass on their advantageous alleles.\n\nTogether, these four points outline the complete process of natural selection.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes statement 5. While statements 1 (heredity) and 2 (variation and overproduction) are key components of selection, statement 5 describes **artificial selection**, not natural selection. In artificial selection, humans are the selecting agent, intentionally choosing individuals with features they find desirable to breed. In natural selection, the environment acts as the selecting agent, and survival and reproduction are determined by an organism's ability to cope with environmental pressures, not human preference.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because, while it includes three crucial components of natural selection (variation, competition, and differential survival), it omits statement 1, which describes heredity. The process of natural selection only leads to evolutionary change if the traits that confer a survival advantage are heritable\u2014that is, if they can be passed from parents to offspring via their alleles. Without the mechanism of inheritance, the increased survival of adapted individuals would have no lasting effect on the genetic makeup of the population in subsequent generations.

Firstly, it includes statement 5, which describes artificial selection (selection by humans) rather than natural selection (selection by the environment). Secondly, it omits statements 1 (heredity) and 2 (variation and overproduction).

Several key processes release carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) into the atmosphere.\n\n1.  **Combustion:** This is the process of burning organic materials, including fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and biomass (wood). This reaction rapidly oxidises the carbon stored in these materials, releasing it into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.\n2.  **Decomposition:** When organisms die, decomposers such as bacteria and fungi break down the complex organic compounds in their bodies. These microorganisms carry out cellular respiration, a process that releases energy for their life functions and has carbon dioxide as a waste product.\n3.  **Respiration:** Cellular respiration is a fundamental metabolic process occurring in almost all living organisms, including plants, animals, and microbes. During respiration, organic compounds (like glucose) are broken down to release energy, with carbon dioxide and water produced as by-products. This CO\u2082 is then released into the atmosphere (e.g., through breathing in animals) or surrounding environment.\n\nTherefore, combustion, decomposition, and respiration are all processes that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1, 2, and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy to synthesise nutrients from carbon dioxide and water.

The organic matter serves as an abundant food source for these bacteria, causing their population to multiply rapidly through aerobic respiration. This rapid bacterial growth leads to a significant increase in the number of bacteria.\n\nThe large population of aerobic bacteria consumes a vast amount of dissolved oxygen from the water as they decompose the organic waste. This process drastically reduces the oxygen concentration in the river. Most aquatic organisms, including fish, macroinvertebrates, and aquatic plants, require high levels of dissolved oxygen to survive. The resulting low-oxygen (anoxic) conditions are lethal to these organisms, causing them to die or migrate. Consequently, the variety of species in the polluted area plummets, leading to a sharp decrease in biodiversity.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: biodiversity decreases, number of bacteria decreases**\nThis option is incorrect because while sewage pollution does cause a decrease in biodiversity, it leads to an increase, not a decrease, in the number of bacteria. The organic waste in sewage provides a rich nutrient source that supports the rapid growth and reproduction of decomposer bacteria.\n\n**C: biodiversity increases, number of bacteria decreases**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. Sewage pollution creates a hostile, low-oxygen environment that is detrimental to most aquatic life, causing biodiversity to decrease significantly. Furthermore, the number of decomposer bacteria increases due to the ample supply of organic matter for them to feed on.\n\n**D: biodiversity increases, number of bacteria increases**\nThis option is incorrect because sewage pollution leads to a severe decrease in biodiversity.

It is caused by the increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, which trap heat. Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and methane (CH\u2084) are the two most significant greenhouse gases contributing to this phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is released primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas released from sources such as agriculture (livestock and rice cultivation) and the decomposition of organic waste in landfills. The increase in both these gases enhances the atmosphere's ability to absorb and re-radiate long-wave (infrared) radiation emitted from the Earth's surface, causing a rise in global temperatures.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. methane and nitrogen:**\nWhile methane (CH\u2084) is a significant greenhouse gas, nitrogen (N\u2082), which constitutes about 78% of the atmosphere, is not. Nitrogen molecules are not effective at absorbing long-wave infrared radiation and therefore do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. Thus, an increase in nitrogen gas does not enhance the greenhouse effect.\n\n**C. nitrogen and oxygen:**\nNeither nitrogen (N\u2082) nor oxygen (O\u2082) are greenhouse gases. These two gases make up approximately 99% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, their simple diatomic structures do not allow them to vibrate in a way that absorbs the energy from long-wave infrared radiation. Consequently, they do not trap heat and do not contribute to the greenhouse effect.\n\n**D. oxygen and carbon dioxide:**\nAlthough carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a primary contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect, oxygen (O\u2082) is not a greenhouse gas.

They reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, which allows for exponential population growth. Under optimal conditions, some bacterial species can double their population in as little as 20 minutes. When a bacterium is genetically modified to produce a useful substance, such as human insulin or an industrial enzyme, it can be grown in a large-scale fermenter. Its rapid reproduction quickly yields a massive population of bacteria, all of which carry the desired gene and produce the target molecule. This allows for the large-scale, cost-effective, and rapid production of valuable products.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** This statement is biologically incorrect. Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms, which are defined by their lack of a membrane-bound nucleus. Their genetic material (a single, circular chromosome and often plasmids) is located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The absence of a nucleus and the presence of simple genetic structures like plasmids are actually features that make bacteria easier to genetically modify, but the statement as written is false.\n\n**C:** While it is true that bacterial cells contain cytoplasm, this is not a specific reason for their use in biotechnology. Cytoplasm is a fundamental component of all living cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. It is the site of many metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, which is essential for biotechnology. However, since nearly all cells possess cytoplasm, this feature does not distinguish bacteria or make them uniquely suitable for biotechnological applications compared to other organisms like yeast.\n\n**D:** This statement is incorrect. The ability of bacteria to produce complex molecules is precisely why they are so valuable in biotechnology. Bacteria possess the necessary cellular machinery, such as ribosomes and enzymes, to synthesize complex proteins, polysaccharides, and other macromolecules. In genetic engineering, a gene for a complex molecule (e.g., a human protein) is inserted into a bacterium, which then uses its own cellular processes to manufacture the molecule.

It is essential that both measurements are in the same units before the calculation is performed. In this case, the size of the image (the length of line XY) is given as 26 mm, and the actual size of the wing is given as 4 mm. Both values are already in millimetres.\n\nApplying the formula:\nMagnification = 26 mm / 4 mm\nMagnification = 6.5\n\nTherefore, the magnification of the diagram is x6.5.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: x0.15**\nThis answer is incorrect because it results from inverting the magnification formula, dividing the actual size by the image size (4 mm / 26 mm \u2248 0.15). A magnification value less than 1 indicates that the image is smaller than the actual object, which is not the case in this diagram.\n\n**C: x22**\nThis answer is incorrect.

This process is passive, meaning it does not require energy. In the lungs, the concentration of oxygen is high within the air sacs (alveoli) and low in the deoxygenated blood arriving in the capillaries surrounding them. Consequently, oxygen molecules move passively across the alveolar and capillary walls and into the red blood cells, following this concentration gradient. This is a classic biological example of diffusion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. dust particles being moved by ciliated cells in the trachea**\nThis describes an active process, not diffusion. Ciliated cells in the trachea use metabolic energy (ATP) to power the wave-like beating of their cilia. This coordinated movement sweeps mucus, along with trapped dust particles, upwards and out of the respiratory tract. This is a form of bulk transport, actively driven by cellular machinery, rather than the passive movement of particles down a concentration gradient.\n\n**C. pollen grains moving from anthers to stigmas in the wind**\nThis process is pollination, which is a form of bulk transport driven by an external agent, the wind. The movement of pollen grains (which are multicellular structures, not individual molecules) is determined by air currents, not by the random motion of particles down a concentration gradient. Therefore, this is not an example of diffusion.\n\n**D. red blood cells moving in a blood capillary in a muscle**\nThe movement of red blood cells through the circulatory system is known as mass flow or bulk flow. This movement is driven by a pressure gradient created by the pumping action of the heart, which requires metabolic energy. Red blood cells are actively transported by the flow of blood plasma and do not move independently down their own concentration gradient.

The water in the beaker has a very high water potential. The solutions A, B, C, and D contain solutes, which lower their water potential. Consequently, there is a water potential gradient between the water in the beaker and the solutions inside the bags, causing water to move into the bags.\n\nThe concentration of a solution is inversely proportional to its water potential; a more concentrated solution has a lower water potential. A larger difference in water potential (a steeper gradient) between the solution and the surrounding water will result in a greater net movement of water into the bag via osmosis. This greater influx of water causes a larger increase in the volume of the solution, forcing the liquid to rise higher up the glass tube.\n\nIn the diagram, the liquid in the glass tube for setup D has risen to the greatest height. This indicates the largest volume of water has moved into the bag, which must be due to the steepest water potential gradient. Therefore, solution D had the lowest water potential at the start, meaning it was the most concentrated solution.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** The liquid level in tube A has risen the least. This signifies the smallest net movement of water into the bag. This corresponds to the shallowest water potential gradient, indicating that solution A had the highest water potential (closest to pure water) and was therefore the least concentrated solution at the start.\n*   **B:** The rise in the liquid level for solution B is greater than for A but less than for C and D. This implies that the initial concentration of solution B was higher than A, but lower than C and D. It was not the most concentrated solution.\n*   **C:** The liquid in tube C has risen higher than in A and B, but not as high as in D.

This process requires energy, which is supplied in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) produced during cellular respiration. The transport itself is facilitated by specific carrier proteins embedded within the cell membrane. Therefore, active transport is not the movement of water, it does use energy from respiration, and it does occur through a cell membrane.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A**\nThis option is incorrect. Active transport is the movement of specific solutes, such as mineral ions or glucose, not the bulk movement of water. The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. Furthermore, active transport is an 'active' process, meaning it requires energy from respiration to move substances against their concentration gradient; this contradicts the claim that it does not use energy. Lastly, active transport is a mechanism for moving substances *across* the cell membrane, so stating it does not involve movement through a cell membrane is also incorrect.\n\n**B**\nThis option incorrectly states that active transport involves the movement of water. The specific process for the movement of water across a cell membrane is osmosis. This option also incorrectly states that active transport does not use energy. A defining characteristic of active transport is its requirement for metabolic energy (ATP from respiration) to move substances against a concentration gradient.\n\n**C**\nThis option correctly identifies that active transport is not the movement of water and that it requires energy from respiration.

Iodine solution, which is typically yellow-brown in colour, reacts with starch to produce a distinct colour change. The iodine molecules (specifically, triiodide ions, I\u2083\u207b) fit into the helical structure of amylose, a component of starch. This interaction forms a starch-iodine complex, which absorbs light differently from the original iodine solution, resulting in a deep blue-black colour. This colour change is the standard positive result indicating the presence of starch.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nA purple colour is not the expected outcome for a positive starch test. This colour is characteristic of the Biuret test for proteins. In the Biuret test, Biuret solution (initially blue) is added to a sample. If protein is present, the copper(II) ions in the solution form a complex with the peptide bonds of the protein, resulting in a colour change to purple or lilac. Therefore, a purple result indicates the presence of protein, not starch.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nA red or brick-red colour is not the characteristic result for the reaction between iodine and starch. A brick-red precipitate is the positive result for the Benedict's test, which is used to detect the presence of reducing sugars. In this test, Benedict's solution is heated with a sample, and if reducing sugars are present, the solution changes from blue to green, yellow, orange, or brick-red, depending on the concentration of the sugar. While iodine can produce a reddish-brown colour with other polysaccharides like glycogen, the standard positive test for starch yields a blue-black colour.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nA yellow or yellow-brown colour is the original colour of the iodine solution itself. If iodine solution is added to a substance that does not contain starch, no reaction will occur, and the solution will remain yellow-brown. This indicates a negative result for the starch test.

This graph accurately illustrates the typical relationship.\n1.  **Initial Rise (Low Temperatures):** At low temperatures, both enzyme and substrate molecules possess low kinetic energy. This results in slow movement and a low frequency of successful collisions between the substrate and the enzyme's active site, leading to low enzyme activity.\n2.  **Increase to Optimum:** As the temperature rises, the kinetic energy of both enzyme and substrate molecules increases. They move faster, leading to more frequent and more energetic collisions. This increases the rate at which enzyme-substrate complexes form, and consequently, the enzyme's activity increases.\n3.  **Optimum Temperature:** The peak of the graph represents the optimum temperature. This is the temperature at which the enzyme exhibits its maximum catalytic activity.\n4.  **Rapid Decline (High Temperatures):** Beyond the optimum temperature, the high thermal energy starts to break the weak hydrogen bonds and other forces that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional tertiary structure. The shape of the active site is altered, and the enzyme is said to be denatured. This change is irreversible. As the active site is no longer complementary to the substrate, the enzyme loses its function, causing a rapid and steep drop in activity.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis graph correctly shows that enzyme activity increases with temperature to an optimum point. However, the subsequent decrease in activity is depicted as a gradual, symmetrical curve. This is incorrect because the process of denaturation, which occurs at temperatures above the optimum, is not a gradual and reversible decline. Denaturation is a rapid, irreversible change to the enzyme's structure that causes a sharp and permanent loss of activity. Therefore, the downward slope of the graph should be much steeper than the upward slope, as shown in graph A.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis graph incorrectly suggests that enzyme activity is high at very low temperatures and decreases as the temperature approaches 50-60\u00b0C, after which it rises dramatically. This is the opposite of the established biological principle. Enzyme activity is low at low temperatures due to low kinetic energy and is destroyed at very high temperatures due to denaturation. An infinitely steep rise at higher temperatures is not biologically possible.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nThis graph incorrectly portrays a V-shaped curve, suggesting that enzyme activity is high at both low and high temperatures but has a minimum activity at a moderate temperature (around 50\u00b0C).

Animal cells do not have chloroplasts, cannot perform photosynthesis, and store excess glucose as glycogen, not starch. Therefore, the synthesis of starch is a process unique to the plant cell among the two options shown.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: controlling the chemical reactions in the cell**\nThis statement is incorrect because the control of cellular chemical reactions (metabolism) is a fundamental process occurring in all living cells, including both plant and animal cells.

Pepsin begins the chemical digestion of proteins by breaking them down into smaller polypeptide chains. Therefore, the stomach is a primary location where protease acts.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe structure labelled A is the mouth (oral cavity). Chemical digestion in the mouth is limited to carbohydrates. Salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains the enzyme salivary amylase. Amylase begins the breakdown of complex carbohydrates like starch into simpler sugars. No protease enzymes are secreted in the mouth, and thus, protein digestion does not occur here.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThe structure labelled B is the esophagus. The primary function of the esophagus is to transport the bolus of food from the pharynx to the stomach through a process of muscular contractions called peristalsis.

Water travels from the roots up to the leaves via the xylem. In the leaf, water evaporates from the surfaces of the mesophyll cells into the air spaces. This creates a high concentration of water vapour within the leaf. When the stomata (small pores on the leaf surface) are open, this water vapour moves out of the leaf into the surrounding atmosphere, down a concentration gradient. This movement of water vapour from a high concentration area to a low concentration area is called diffusion. Therefore, the statement that water vapour diffuses out of the leaves is the most accurate description of transpiration.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: Water is pulled upwards by active transport.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The upward movement of water in the xylem is a passive process, not an active one. It is driven by the transpiration pull, which is a physical force generated by the evaporation of water from the leaves. This process relies on the cohesive properties of water (water molecules sticking together) and adhesive properties (water molecules sticking to the xylem walls), not on the expenditure of metabolic energy (ATP) which is characteristic of active transport. Active transport is used, for example, to move mineral ions into root cells, but not for the bulk flow of water up the stem.\n\n**B: Water is pulled up from the roots by phloem.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the plant's vascular tissue responsible for water transport. Plants have two main transport tissues: xylem and phloem. The xylem is responsible for transporting water and dissolved mineral ions from the roots to the rest of the plant. The phloem is responsible for transporting sugars, produced during photosynthesis, from the leaves to other parts of the plant in a process called translocation. Therefore, water is pulled up from the roots by the xylem, not the phloem.\n\n**C: Water moves by osmosis inside the xylem vessels.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Osmosis is the net movement of water across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. While osmosis is crucial for the initial uptake of water from the soil into the root hair cells, it is not the mechanism for water movement *inside* the xylem vessels. Xylem vessels are dead, hollow tubes that form a continuous column without cell membranes. The movement of water through these vessels is best described as bulk flow or mass flow, driven by the pressure difference created by transpiration, rather than by osmosis."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_221.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "21 which statement describes the circulation of blood in the human body?\na blood is pumped away from the heart by the atria.\nb_ blood is pumped away from the heart through arteries.\nc_ blood is pumped away from the heart through veins.\nd_ blood is pumped to the heart through capillaries.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\nBlood is pumped from the powerful muscular ventricles of the heart into arteries. By definition, arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. The aorta, the body's largest artery, carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. Arteries have thick, muscular, and elastic walls to withstand the high pressure of the blood being pumped directly from the heart.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. Blood is pumped away from the heart by the atria.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The atria are the upper chambers that receive blood returning to the heart; the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body, and the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs. The ventricles are the lower, more muscular chambers that contract to pump blood *away* from the heart. Therefore, the ventricles, not the atria, are responsible for pumping blood out of the heart.\n\n**C. Blood is pumped away from the heart through veins.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood *towards* the heart.

Blood in veins is at a much lower pressure than in arteries.\n\n**D. Blood is pumped to the heart through capillaries.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and form extensive networks that link arteries and veins. Their primary function is to facilitate the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's tissues. Blood flows from arteries into capillaries and then collects in veins to be transported back to the heart.

This can occur through direct physical contact or the direct transfer of bodily fluids. Transfusing contaminated blood is a method where infected blood, a bodily fluid, is introduced directly into the bloodstream of another person. This fits the definition of direct transmission, as there is no intermediate object or medium; the pathogen moves directly from one body to another.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. breathing in pathogens in air**\nThis describes **airborne transmission**, which is a form of **indirect transmission**. In this method, pathogens are contained within droplets or dust particles that remain suspended in the air for a period. The air acts as an intermediate medium, carrying the pathogen from the infected individual to the susceptible host who inhales them. There is no direct physical contact between the two individuals.\n\n**B. eating contaminated food**\nThis is an example of **vehicle-borne transmission**, a type of **indirect transmission**. The food serves as a 'vehicle' or an inanimate medium that carries the pathogen from the source to the host. The infection occurs when the contaminated food is ingested. Because the food acts as an intermediary, this transmission route is not direct.\n\n**D. touching a door handle that has pathogens on it**\nThis is a form of **indirect transmission** known as **fomite transmission**. A fomite is any inanimate object (like a door handle, a toy, or clothing) that can become contaminated with infectious agents and serve as a mechanism for their transfer.

The primary function of the kidneys is to excrete metabolic waste products from the body. Blood containing waste, such as urea, is constantly filtered by the kidneys. In the functional units of the kidney, called nephrons, urea is removed from the blood plasma along with excess water and mineral salts to form urine. This process of filtering waste from the blood and producing urine for removal is known as excretion. Therefore, the kidney is the organ responsible for the excretion of urea.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** The organ labelled B is the urinary bladder. The bladder is a muscular sac that serves as a storage reservoir for urine produced by the kidneys. While it is an essential part of the urinary system and holds the urea-containing urine before it is expelled, it does not perform the physiological process of excretion, which is the removal of waste products from the blood.\n\n**C:** The structure labelled C is the urethra. The urethra is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body, allowing for the passage of urine during urination (micturition). It is involved in the final elimination of urine but is not the organ responsible for filtering urea from the blood.\n\n**D:** The organ labelled D is the liver. The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of proteins. It is the site where excess amino acids are broken down in a process called deamination. This process produces toxic ammonia, which the liver quickly converts into a less toxic compound, urea, through the urea cycle. While the liver *produces* urea, it does not excrete it.

It contains specialized photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Rods are highly sensitive to light intensity and enable vision in low-light conditions (scotopic vision). Cones are responsible for detecting colour and fine detail in bright light (photopic vision). When light enters the eye and is focused onto the retina, these photoreceptors convert the light energy into nerve impulses. These impulses are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, where they are interpreted as visual images.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: cornea**\nThe cornea is the transparent, protective outer layer at the front of the eye. Its primary function is to refract (bend) light as it enters the eye, providing the majority of the eye's focusing power. The cornea does not contain any light-sensitive cells; its role is purely optical.\n\n**B: iris**\nThe iris is the pigmented, muscular diaphragm that gives the eye its colour. It surrounds the pupil and controls its size, thereby regulating the amount of light that reaches the retina.

It initiates the 'fight-or-flight' response, preparing the body for vigorous physical activity.\n\n1.  **Effect on Pupil Diameter:** Adrenaline causes the radial muscles in the iris of the eye to contract. This pulls the iris back, causing the pupil to dilate (increase in diameter). Wider pupils allow more light to enter the eye, enhancing vision to better perceive threats or surroundings.\n\n2.  **Effect on Heart Rate:** Adrenaline increases the heart rate and the force of the heart's contractions. This ensures that more oxygenated blood is pumped more rapidly to the muscles and brain, supplying the necessary energy for a rapid response.\n\nTherefore, the secretion of adrenaline leads to an increase in both pupil diameter and heart rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: pupil diameter decreases, heart rate decreases**\nThis option is incorrect. A decrease in heart rate and pupil diameter (constriction) are effects associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's 'rest-and-digest' functions. Adrenaline, part of the sympathetic nervous system's response, has the opposite effects.\n\n**B: pupil diameter decreases, heart rate increases**\nThis option is incorrect.

MRSA developed resistance to antibiotic F between 1981 and 2000.**\n\nThis statement is the correct conclusion as it accurately interprets the overall trend shown in the graph. The graph illustrates a decline in the percentage effectiveness of antibiotic F against MRSA over the 20-year period. A decrease in antibiotic effectiveness signifies that the bacterial population is becoming less susceptible to the antibiotic. This phenomenon is known as the development of antibiotic resistance. Through the process of natural selection, individual MRSA bacteria with mutations conferring resistance survive exposure to the antibiotic and reproduce, passing the resistance trait to their offspring. Over time, this leads to an increase in the proportion of resistant bacteria in the population, causing the antibiotic to become progressively less effective, as shown by the downward slope of the line on the graph.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A.

Genes are specific segments of DNA located on chromosomes, and they carry the instructions for inherited traits. Different alleles arise from mutations, which cause variations in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA at a particular gene's location (locus). For example, the gene for flower colour in pea plants has two alleles: one that codes for purple flowers and another that codes for white flowers. Both alleles are versions of the same gene and are composed of DNA.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an alternative form of a chromosome made of DNA**\nThis statement is incorrect because an allele is a variant of a gene, not an entire chromosome. A chromosome is a large, complex structure that contains hundreds or thousands of genes. While homologous chromosomes (one inherited from each parent) carry genes for the same traits, they can have different alleles for those genes. However, the allele itself is a small segment of DNA (the gene), not an alternative form of the whole chromosome.\n\n**B. an alternative form of a chromosome made of protein**\nThis statement is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, as with option A, an allele is a variant of a gene, not a chromosome. Secondly, the genetic information in a chromosome is carried by the DNA, not the protein. While chromosomes are composed of both DNA and proteins (histones), the proteins primarily serve to package and condense the DNA, while the DNA sequence itself constitutes the genes and their alleles.\n\n**D. an alternative form of a gene made of protein**\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the molecular composition of a gene. Genes are the fundamental units of heredity and are made of DNA. They contain the instructions that a cell uses to synthesise proteins. A gene is not made of protein; rather, it codes for the production of a protein. Therefore, an allele, being an alternative form of a gene, is also made of DNA, not protein."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_234.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "34 the images show four animals.\n1 2\n| .~ i\nae eg \u201c : 2 ae | ie 2 y\"\n: : 4 ac =\" -\u2014 : = : ei \" :\neo i $ 4% : \u2018\n4 *. ge tt \u2014 ss\nsheep eagle\n3 4\n*,. s ae is i 7 abe.\nx te bs ote ee\npen fok 4 baa\na rg\nor ae f- \u00bb bol) ve sng 252)\n- ae & onan 4 vie\n~ mee ls om et 4\nying 4 a \u201c8 \u2018 j j\nwy / <a baan = e) sw\ndea eos ee\ntortoise tiger\nwhich two animals show adaptive features for being secondary consumers?\na iand3 b 1and4 c 2and3 d 2and4", "Chapter": 18, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D (2 and 4)\n\nIn a food chain, producers (like plants) are eaten by primary consumers (herbivores).

During aerobic respiration, organic compounds such as glucose are broken down in the presence of oxygen to release energy for life processes. Carbon dioxide is a primary waste product of this reaction and is released into the atmosphere.\n*   **Combustion** is the process of burning organic matter, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and wood. This chemical reaction rapidly combines carbon-containing substances with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of heat and light, and producing carbon dioxide and water as by-products.\n*   **Decomposition** is the breakdown of dead organic matter by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. These decomposers carry out respiration, consuming the organic compounds from the dead organisms and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they do so.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) Incorrect.** This option is incorrect because more than one of the listed processes releases carbon dioxide. While respiration, combustion, or decomposition alone would fit this count, all three processes release carbon dioxide, making the total higher than one.\n\n**B) Incorrect.** This option is incorrect because it underestimates the number of processes that release carbon dioxide.

Forest ecosystems have extensive and complex root systems that bind soil particles together, creating a stable soil structure. The canopy of the forest also intercepts heavy rainfall, reducing its impact on the ground. When trees are cleared for farming, these protective mechanisms are removed. The soil is left exposed to the elements, such as wind and rain. Without the network of roots to hold it in place, the topsoil is easily eroded and washed or blown away. This leads to an increased rate of soil loss, which can degrade the land and reduce its fertility.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. decreased release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Forests act as significant carbon sinks, meaning they absorb and store large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere in their biomass (trunks, leaves, and roots) through photosynthesis. When forests are cleared, two things happen:\n1.  The process of clearing, often involving burning (slash-and-burn agriculture), releases the vast quantities of stored carbon back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.\n2.  The removal of trees eliminates their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nTherefore, deforestation leads to an *increased* release and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not a decrease.\n\n**B. increased biodiversity**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life within an ecosystem. Forests are among the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, providing habitats, food, and shelter for a vast number of different species of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. Converting a forest into farmland, which typically involves planting a single crop (monoculture), drastically reduces the number of available habitats and food sources. This results in a significant *decrease* in biodiversity as most of the original species cannot survive in the new agricultural environment.\n\n**D. increased release of oxygen into the atmosphere**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Trees in a forest carry out photosynthesis on a massive scale, making forests major producers of atmospheric oxygen. When a forest is cleared, the number of photosynthesising organisms in that area is dramatically reduced. As a result, the rate of oxygen production and its release into the atmosphere *decreases* significantly."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_239.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "39 what is a use of ethanol?\na __ biofuel production\nb biological washing powder\nc_bread-making\nd - fruit juice production", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nEthanol is widely used as a biofuel. It is produced on a large scale through the fermentation of biomass, such as sugarcane or corn, by microorganisms like yeast. During this process, the sugars in the plant material are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting ethanol is a high-energy molecule that can be combusted (burned) to release energy. It is often blended with petrol (gasoline) to create gasohol, which is used to power vehicles, thereby reducing the reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nBiological washing powders do not use ethanol as an active ingredient. Instead, they contain enzymes, such as proteases and lipases. These enzymes are biological catalysts that break down large, insoluble stain molecules (like proteins from blood or fats from grease) into smaller, soluble molecules that can be washed away easily. Ethanol, being an alcohol, can denature proteins, which would inactivate the very enzymes that make these washing powders effective.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nIn bread-making, ethanol is a *product* of the process, not a substance that is *used*. Yeast is added to the dough, where it carries out anaerobic respiration (fermentation). This process breaks down sugars in the flour to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol. The carbon dioxide gas is trapped in the dough, causing it to rise. The ethanol is an unwanted by-product that evaporates during the baking process. Therefore, ethanol is not used for making bread.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nEthanol is not used in the production of fruit juice. To maximise the yield of juice from fruit, the enzyme pectinase is often added. Pectinase breaks down pectin, a substance that helps hold plant cell walls together. By breaking down the pectin, more juice can be extracted from the fruit pulp.

This specific response is known as positive phototropism. It is an advantageous behaviour as it positions the leaves to receive maximum sunlight for photosynthesis. This detection and response to a stimulus is a clear demonstration of sensitivity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Excretion:**\nExcretion is the process by which organisms remove metabolic waste products (e.g., carbon dioxide, urea) and toxic substances from their bodies. The growth of a plant towards a light source is a directional movement in response to an environmental stimulus; it is not a process of eliminating waste materials.\n\n**B) Nutrition:**\nNutrition is the process of obtaining and assimilating food for energy, growth, and repair. Plants are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food through photosynthesis, which requires light energy.

Its structure is highly specialized for motility to travel through a liquid medium and fertilize a female gamete (egg). The key adaptation for swimming is the long, whip-like tail called a flagellum. The flagellum undulates, propelling the cell forward. The midpiece of the sperm cell contains a high concentration of mitochondria, which carry out aerobic respiration to provide the large amount of ATP (energy) required for the powerful movements of the flagellum. The head is streamlined to reduce resistance during swimming.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis diagram illustrates a typical plant cell, likely a palisade or epidermal cell. It is characterized by a rigid cellulose cell wall outside the cell membrane. This cell wall provides structural support and maintains a fixed, rectangular shape.

As particles (such as molecules or ions) gain more kinetic energy, they move more rapidly and randomly. This increased speed of movement leads to more frequent collisions and a faster net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Consequently, the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the temperature. Graph D correctly illustrates this positive linear relationship, showing that as temperature rises, the rate of diffusion also rises.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis graph, with its characteristic bell shape, represents the effect of temperature on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction. The rate increases with temperature up to an optimal point, beyond which the high temperature causes the enzyme to denature. Denaturation changes the specific three-dimensional shape of the enzyme's active site, rendering it less effective or completely inactive, which leads to a rapid decrease in the reaction rate. Diffusion is a passive physical process that does not involve enzymes, so it is not limited by denaturation at high temperatures.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis graph depicts a relationship where the rate of diffusion is high at low temperatures, decreases to a minimum, and then increases as temperature rises further. This U-shaped curve does not accurately represent the relationship between temperature and the rate of diffusion. According to the kinetic theory of matter, a higher temperature always results in greater kinetic energy and therefore a faster rate of diffusion. There is no physical basis for the rate of diffusion to decrease as temperature initially increases.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis graph shows a negative linear relationship, suggesting that as temperature increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. This is the opposite of the actual effect. Increasing the temperature provides particles with more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and spread out more quickly.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential (lower solute concentration) to a region of lower water potential (higher solute concentration). In both cases, this gradient drives the movement. Therefore, this characteristic applies to both.\n*   **Requires a partially permeable membrane:** This is a requirement for osmosis by definition. However, diffusion is a more general process that can occur in any medium (gas, liquid, or across a membrane). Since diffusion does not always require a membrane, this characteristic does not apply to *both* processes.\n*   **Are energy-consuming processes:** Both osmosis and diffusion are passive. The movement is driven by the random kinetic energy inherent in the molecules, not by metabolic energy (such as ATP) supplied by the cell. Therefore, neither process is energy-consuming.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only characteristic that is always true for both osmosis and diffusion is the requirement for a concentration gradient.

It incorrectly states that a concentration gradient is not required for both processes, when in fact the gradient is the driving force for both. It also incorrectly states that these are energy-consuming processes; both are passive and do not require metabolic energy.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly claims that a concentration gradient is not required for both processes.

This movement is described as being **against the concentration gradient**. Because this process moves substances against the natural direction of diffusion, it requires an input of energy. This energy is supplied by the cell in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced during cellular respiration. Therefore, active transport is correctly described as the movement of particles against a concentration gradient, using energy from respiration.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because while active transport does move particles against the concentration gradient, it is an energy-dependent process. Moving a substance \"uphill\" against its concentration gradient requires metabolic energy from the cell, which is supplied by respiration. The statement that it uses \"no\" energy is incorrect.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because movement **down the concentration gradient** (from high to low concentration) describes passive transport processes like diffusion or facilitated diffusion.

For the quickest reaction, conditions must be optimal.\n\n1.  **Optimal pH:** The enzyme is stated to function in the duodenum. The environment of the duodenum is neutral to slightly alkaline, typically with a pH between 7.0 and 8.5. This is because bicarbonate ions secreted by the pancreas and the duodenal wall neutralize the acidic chyme from the stomach. Therefore, a pH of 7 is the optimal choice among the given options.\n2.  **Optimal Temperature:** As an enzyme from the human body, Enzyme X will function most efficiently at or near human body temperature, which is approximately 37\u00b0C. A temperature of 35\u00b0C is very close to this optimum.\n\nTest-tube D provides the conditions closest to the physiological optimum for both pH (7) and temperature (35\u00b0C). Consequently, the enzyme's activity will be at its highest, and starch digestion will occur at the fastest rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option is incorrect because both the pH and temperature are far from the optimal conditions for an enzyme functioning in the duodenum.\n*   A pH of 2 is extremely acidic. An enzyme adapted to the neutral conditions of the duodenum would be denatured at this pH. Denaturation is an irreversible change in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including its active site, rendering it non-functional.\n*   A temperature of 20\u00b0C is significantly lower than the optimal temperature of ~37\u00b0C. At this low temperature, enzyme and substrate molecules have low kinetic energy, leading to a very low frequency of effective collisions and thus a very slow rate of reaction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because the pH is not suitable for the enzyme. While the temperature of 35\u00b0C is near-optimal for a human enzyme, the pH of 2 is highly acidic. The enzyme, which is adapted to function in the neutral environment of the duodenum, will be denatured by the extreme acidity. The active site's shape will be altered, preventing it from binding to the starch substrate. Therefore, despite the favourable temperature, digestion will be extremely slow or will not occur at all.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because the temperature is too low for the maximum rate of reaction. Although the pH of 7 is optimal for an enzyme in the duodenum, the temperature of 20\u00b0C is significantly below the optimal body temperature of ~37\u00b0C. At this lower temperature, enzyme and starch molecules possess less kinetic energy.

It plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy digestive system. When a person is constipated, it means that faeces are moving too slowly through the large intestine, often becoming hard and difficult to pass. Increasing the intake of fibre helps to alleviate this condition in two main ways:\n1.  **Adds Bulk:** Since fibre cannot be digested by human enzymes, it passes through the small intestine and into the large intestine largely intact. Here, it adds bulk to the undigested food matter. This increased volume stimulates the muscular walls of the large intestine to contract more regularly and forcefully, a process known as peristalsis, which moves the faeces along towards the rectum.\n2.  **Softens Stool:** Fibre absorbs and retains water, which makes the faeces softer and bulkier. This makes them much easier to pass, reducing strain and discomfort.\n\nTherefore, a diet rich in fibre from sources like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes is the recommended way to prevent and treat constipation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. fats:** Fats are an essential macronutrient, primarily providing energy and facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. However, a diet high in fats, particularly when low in fibre, can actually slow down digestion and the rate at which the stomach empties. This can contribute to constipation rather than relieve it. While a balanced intake of fats is necessary, increasing them is not a remedy for constipation.\n\n**C. iron:** Iron is a vital mineral required for the synthesis of haemoglobin in red blood cells, which is essential for oxygen transport. While crucial for health, high iron intake, especially from supplements, is a well-known cause of constipation. Iron can harden the stool and decrease the motility of the intestine, making the condition worse.\n\n**D. protein:** Protein is a fundamental macronutrient necessary for building and repairing tissues, as well as for synthesising enzymes and hormones. Diets that are very high in protein but low in carbohydrates and fibre (e.g., diets with a high proportion of meat and few vegetables or whole grains) are often associated with an increased risk of constipation. This is because there is insufficient fibre to add bulk to the stool and promote regular bowel movements.

Canines are long and pointed (conical) in shape. Their primary function is to grip, hold, and tear food, which is particularly important in diets that include meat. This tearing action is distinct from the grinding function of molars.\n\n**B) sharp-edged teeth to cut food**\nThis description refers to incisor teeth.

The enzyme lipase is responsible for the chemical digestion of these fats. Lipase acts as a catalyst to hydrolyze fats, meaning it breaks them down by adding water molecules. This process severs the ester bonds that link the fatty acids to the glycerol backbone. As a result, the fat molecule is broken down into its constituent components: fatty acids and glycerol. Therefore, both fatty acids (2) and glycerol (3) are the products of the action of lipase on fats.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. 1 and 3:** This option is incorrect because amino acids (1) are not produced from the digestion of fats.

Its structure is highly specialised for this function. The inner lining is extensively folded and covered with millions of tiny, finger-like projections called villi. The epithelial cells on the surface of these villi are themselves covered in even smaller projections called microvilli. This combination of folds, villi, and microvilli creates an immense surface area (roughly the size of a tennis court) for absorption. Most chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is completed in the small intestine, breaking them down into small, soluble molecules (like monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol) that can be efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. colon**\nThe colon, also known as the large intestine, is not the primary site for nutrient absorption. Its main functions are the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and the compaction of this material into faeces.

This includes person-to-person touching, such as a handshake, or direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, or semen. In this mode of transmission, the pathogen moves from one host to the next without an intermediate object or substance. For example, diseases like HIV and Hepatitis B are transmitted through direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. breathing in pathogens:** This is an example of airborne or droplet transmission, which is a form of indirect contact. In this case, pathogens are contained within small droplets of fluid expelled by an infected host (e.g., through coughing or sneezing). These droplets travel through the air and are inhaled by a new host. The air acts as the medium for transmission, meaning there is no direct physical contact between the two hosts. Influenza and tuberculosis are common examples of diseases spread this way.\n\n**C. contact with contaminated surfaces:** This is an example of indirect transmission via a fomite (an inanimate object). An infected person may transfer pathogens to a surface like a doorknob or a table. A second person can then touch this contaminated surface and subsequently transfer the pathogen to their own body, typically by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. The surface acts as an intermediary, so the transmission is indirect, not direct.\n\n**D. eating or handling contaminated food:** This describes vehicle-borne transmission, a type of indirect contact. The pathogen is carried by a 'vehicle'\u2014in this case, food. Food or water can become contaminated with pathogens, often from the faeces of an infected person or animal.

The primary function of the alveoli is gas exchange. They are surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries. The walls of both the alveoli and the capillaries are extremely thin, typically only one cell thick. This creates a very short diffusion distance, allowing oxygen to move rapidly from the inhaled air into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide to move from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.

Body mass in humans is an excellent example of this. Within a population, individuals do not fall into distinct weight categories; instead, their mass can be any value along a continuous spectrum (e.g., 60 kg, 60.5 kg, 61 kg). This type of variation is typically polygenic, meaning it is controlled by the combined effects of multiple genes, and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, lifestyle, and health. When data for a continuously variable trait is plotted for a large population, it typically forms a normal distribution curve (a bell-shaped curve).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**A: ABO blood groups in humans**\nABO blood groups are an example of discontinuous variation. In this type of variation, individuals fall into a limited number of distinct, non-overlapping categories. There are four specific blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. An individual has one of these types, and there are no intermediate forms (e.g., a phenotype between group A and group B does not exist). Discontinuous variation is typically controlled by a single gene (in this case, the ABO gene with three alleles: I\u1d2c, I\u1d2e, and i) and is not influenced by environmental factors.\n\n**C: seed shape in pea plants**\nSeed shape in pea plants is a classic example of discontinuous variation, as studied by Gregor Mendel. The seeds exhibit one of two distinct phenotypes: they are either round or wrinkled. There are no intermediate seed shapes. This clear-cut difference is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. Because the characteristic falls into discrete categories rather than a continuous range, it represents discontinuous variation.\n\n**D: seed colour in pea plants**\nSeed colour in pea plants is another example of discontinuous variation. The seeds have one of two distinct colours: yellow or green. There are no intermediate shades or a continuous spectrum of colours between these two options. This trait is controlled by a single gene, resulting in separate and clearly defined phenotypic categories, which is the hallmark of discontinuous variation."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_275.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "35 a particular animal species only eats plants.\nwhat is a description of this animal species?\na acarnivore\nba primary consumer\nc  aproducer\nd  asecondary consumer", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nIn an ecosystem, organisms are classified into trophic levels based on their feeding relationships.

During this process, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the environment. Using light energy, they convert these inorganic substances into glucose (an organic carbon compound for energy storage) and oxygen (a waste product). Therefore, photosynthesis is the primary process in the carbon cycle that removes, or 'uses', carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, incorporating its carbon into organic matter.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A. combustion**\n\nCombustion is the process of burning. In the context of the carbon cycle, this typically refers to the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and biomass (like wood). This process releases the carbon that was stored in these organic materials back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Consequently, combustion is a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, not a process that uses it.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B. decomposition**\n\nDecomposition is the breakdown of dead organic material by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. These decomposers carry out cellular respiration as they break down the complex carbon compounds in the dead matter to obtain energy. A major product of this respiration is carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere and soil. Thus, decomposition releases carbon dioxide, it does not use it.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C. respiration**\n\nCellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of nearly all living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. It involves the breakdown of organic molecules, primarily glucose, to release energy for life processes. Carbon dioxide and water are waste products of this reaction.

Firstly, trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis. Removing large areas of forest reduces the planet's capacity to remove this greenhouse gas, leading to its accumulation. Secondly, the methods of clearing forests, such as burning (slash-and-burn), release vast amounts of carbon stored in the trees' biomass directly into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Decomposition of the remaining dead plant material by microorganisms also releases carbon dioxide.\n\n*   **Statement 3: Deforestation causes an increase in the loss of soil.** This is also correct. The roots of trees and other forest plants bind soil particles together, creating a stable soil structure. The forest canopy intercepts heavy rainfall, reducing its force and preventing it from washing away the topsoil. When trees are removed, the soil is left exposed and vulnerable to erosion by both wind and water, leading to significant soil loss.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. 1 and 2 only:** This option is incorrect because statement 2 is false.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat, keeping the Earth warm enough for life. These gases absorb long-wave (infrared) radiation emitted from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space and thus warming the lower atmosphere. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and certain agricultural practices, have increased the concentration of these gases, leading to an 'enhanced' greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant long-lived greenhouse gas, while methane is more potent at trapping heat on a per-molecule basis.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. carbon dioxide and nitrogen:** While carbon dioxide is a key greenhouse gas, nitrogen (N\u2082) is not. Nitrogen constitutes about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, but its molecular structure (a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms) does not allow it to absorb long-wave infrared radiation. Therefore, it does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.\n\n**C. methane and oxygen:** While methane is a potent greenhouse gas, oxygen (O\u2082) is not. Oxygen, which makes up about 21% of the atmosphere, is, like nitrogen, a diatomic molecule with a symmetrical structure. This structure prevents it from vibrating in a way that absorbs infrared radiation, so it does not trap heat and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.\n\n**D. nitrogen and oxygen:** Neither nitrogen (N\u2082) nor oxygen (O\u2082) are greenhouse gases. Together, they make up approximately 99% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, due to their simple, symmetrical diatomic structures, they are transparent to the long-wave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth.

While sustainable practices exist for both resources, they are frequently exploited in an unsustainable manner.\n\n**Using fish stocks:** Sustainable management involves regulating fishing activities to ensure that fish populations can replenish themselves. This includes setting fishing quotas, restricting the size of nets to allow young fish to escape, and establishing protected breeding seasons. However, overfishing is a significant global issue where fish are removed from the water faster than they can reproduce. This leads to the depletion of fish stocks, disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening the long-term availability of fish as a food source. Because overfishing is common, the use of fish stocks is not always sustainable.\n\n**Using wood from forests:** Sustainable forestry involves harvesting timber at a rate that allows the forest to regenerate, often through replanting trees and selective logging.

Bacteria possess the necessary cellular machinery, including ribosomes and enzymes, to produce complex proteins like human insulin or enzymes for industrial processes when they are genetically modified. Furthermore, their rapid reproduction rate, often through binary fission every 20-30 minutes under optimal conditions, allows for the large-scale production of these desired molecules in a short period. A small culture of engineered bacteria can quickly multiply into a massive population, making the process commercially viable. In contrast, the bacterial cell wall is not a useful feature for biotechnology. It acts as a physical barrier that can hinder the introduction of foreign DNA (e.g., plasmids during transformation) and complicates the extraction of the manufactured product from within the cell.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the bacterial cell wall as a useful feature and the rapid reproduction rate as not useful. The cell wall presents a barrier that must be overcome to introduce genetic material and extract products, making it a challenge rather than an advantage. The rapid reproduction rate is a primary reason for using bacteria, as it allows for efficient, large-scale production of biotechnological products.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies all three features. It claims the cell wall is useful, which it is not, as it obstructs key biotechnological steps. Crucially, it claims that the ability to make complex molecules and the rapid reproduction rate are not useful. These two features are, in fact, the most significant reasons why bacteria are a cornerstone of the biotechnology industry, serving as miniature factories that can be scaled up quickly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the cell wall is not a useful feature and that a rapid reproduction rate is highly advantageous. However, it incorrectly states that the ability of bacteria to make complex molecules is not useful.

The cell was placed in a dilute solution of salts, which means the concentration of solutes outside the cell is lower than inside the cell's cytoplasm and vacuole. Consequently, the water potential of the external solution is higher than the water potential inside the cell. This creates a water potential gradient, causing water to move from the solution into the cell by osmosis. The influx of water increases the volume of the central vacuole, which pushes the cytoplasm and cell membrane against the rigid cell wall, causing the cell to become turgid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Dissolved salts enter the cell by diffusion.**\nThis is incorrect. The external solution is described as \"dilute,\" meaning it has a lower concentration of dissolved salts than the cell's cytoplasm. Diffusion is the movement of particles down a concentration gradient, from a high concentration to a low concentration. Therefore, salts would tend to move out of the cell, not into it. Furthermore, the significant change observed is the swelling of the cell, which is due to the movement of water, not salts.\n\n**B: Dissolved salts leave the cell by diffusion.**\nThis is incorrect. While it is true that the salt concentration is higher inside the cell than in the surrounding dilute solution, leading to a concentration gradient for salts to diffuse out, this is not the primary process explaining the observed change. The cell membrane is only partially permeable to salts, and their movement is relatively slow. The most significant and rapid change is the swelling of the cell, which is a direct result of the bulk movement of water by osmosis, not the movement of solutes.\n\n**D: Water leaves the cell by osmosis.**\nThis is incorrect. Water would leave the cell by osmosis only if the external solution had a lower water potential (i.e., was more concentrated) than the cell's contents. In such a scenario, the cell would lose water, and the cell membrane would pull away from the cell wall, a process called plasmolysis.

This phenomenon is a direct result of the intrinsic kinetic energy possessed by all molecules, which causes them to be in constant, random motion. In an area with a high concentration of oxygen, molecules are more likely to move away from that area than into it, simply due to probability. This results in a net movement towards areas of lower oxygen concentration, such as the inside of a respiring plant cell. Thus, the fundamental cause of diffusion is the random movement of molecules.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: active transport**\nActive transport is the movement of substances across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient (from a low concentration to a high concentration). This process requires specific carrier proteins and the expenditure of metabolic energy, typically from ATP. Diffusion is a passive process that does not require energy and follows the concentration gradient. Therefore, active transport is not the mechanism for oxygen moving into a cell.\n\n**C: osmosis**\nOsmosis is the specific term for the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. It describes the net movement of water from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. The question asks about the movement of oxygen, not water. While osmosis is a type of diffusion, the term is reserved exclusively for the movement of water.\n\n**D: photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plant cells use light energy to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, photosynthesis is a process that *produces* oxygen within the cell. This would increase the oxygen concentration inside the cell, causing oxygen to diffuse *out*, not *in*.

Benedict's solution itself is an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, sodium carbonate, and sodium citrate, which has a distinct blue colour due to the presence of copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a).\n\nWhen this solution is heated in the presence of a reducing sugar (such as glucose or maltose), the sugar donates electrons to the copper(II) ions. This process reduces the blue copper(II) ions (Cu\u00b2\u207a) to red copper(I) ions (Cu\u207a), which then precipitate out of the solution as insoluble copper(I) oxide (Cu\u2082O). This precipitate has a characteristic brick-red colour.\n\nTherefore, a positive test for a reducing sugar involves a colour change from the initial blue of the Benedict's solution to a final brick-red colour. The exact final colour can vary depending on the concentration of the reducing sugar, progressing from green (low concentration) to yellow, orange, and finally brick-red (high concentration). The overall change from blue to red represents a strong positive result.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: blue to purple**\nThis colour change is characteristic of the Biuret test for proteins. Biuret solution, which is also blue, reacts with the peptide bonds present in protein molecules to form a purple or violet-coloured complex. This test does not involve heating and is used to detect proteins, not reducing sugars.\n\n**C: brown to blue-black**\nThis colour change is the positive result for the iodine test for starch. Iodine solution, which is initially yellow-brown, turns blue-black in the presence of starch. This occurs because the iodine molecules fit into the helical structure of the starch polymer, forming a distinctively coloured starch-iodine complex. The initial colour of Benedict's solution is blue, not brown.\n\n**D: red to yellow**\nThis is an incorrect description of the Benedict's test. The initial colour of Benedict's solution is blue, not red. Furthermore, in a positive test, the colour change progresses from blue through green, yellow, and orange towards red as the concentration of the reducing sugar increases. A change from red to yellow would be a reversal of this progression."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_289.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "9 the diagram shows the digestive system.\nwhich part absorbs the most water?\nes\n<\ny\n\nwo\n\nd h\nes \\ 3\n\nc _ [te wr |\n| ;", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D**\n\nPart D represents the small intestine. The primary role of the small intestine is the chemical digestion of food and the absorption of the resulting nutrients into the bloodstream. Due to its extensive length and a vast internal surface area, created by folds, villi, and microvilli, it is exceptionally efficient at absorption. While it absorbs the majority of nutrients, it is also the site where the largest volume of water is absorbed from the digestive tract. Water moves from the lumen of the small intestine into the blood via osmosis, following the concentration gradient established by the active transport of salts and the absorption of other solutes like glucose and amino acids.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** Part A is the stomach. The main functions of the stomach are the mechanical churning of food and the beginning of protein digestion by the enzyme pepsin in an acidic environment. The stomach wall is not specialised for absorption, and only very small amounts of water, some salts, alcohol, and certain drugs are absorbed here.\n\n**B:** Part B is the large intestine. A key function of the large intestine is the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter. However, the volume of water absorbed in the large intestine is significantly less than that absorbed in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily reclaims the water that was not absorbed earlier, compacting the waste into faeces.\n\n**C:** Part C is the rectum, the final section of the large intestine.

The graph shows that the curve for enzyme R is above the x-axis in the temperature range of approximately 45 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C, meaning it is active within this range. The curve for enzyme S is above the x-axis in the range of approximately 70 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C. At a temperature of 75 \u00b0C, both the curve for enzyme R and the curve for enzyme S are above the x-axis. This indicates that both enzymes are catalysing reactions at this temperature. Therefore, this conclusion is a correct interpretation of the data.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nFor an enzyme to be active, its corresponding curve on the graph must be above the x-axis, indicating a non-zero activity level. The activity range for enzyme P is from approximately 0 \u00b0C to 20 \u00b0C. At 25 \u00b0C, the curve for enzyme P is on the x-axis, signifying zero activity. While enzyme Q is active at 25 \u00b0C (its curve is above the axis), the statement requires both enzymes to be active. Since enzyme P is inactive at 25 \u00b0C, the conclusion is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe optimum temperature for an enzyme is the temperature at which it demonstrates its maximum activity. On the graph, this corresponds to the peak of the activity curve. For enzyme P, the highest point (peak) of its curve aligns with a temperature of 10 \u00b0C on the x-axis. Although enzyme P shows some activity at 0 \u00b0C, it is not its maximum activity. Therefore, the optimum temperature for enzyme P is 10 \u00b0C, not 0 \u00b0C.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe optimum temperature is the temperature of maximum enzyme activity, identified as the peak of the curve. The activity curve for enzyme S reaches its highest point at a temperature of 90 \u00b0C. This is the optimum temperature for enzyme S. At temperatures exceeding 90 \u00b0C, the enzyme's activity declines sharply due to denaturation, and it becomes completely inactive at 100 \u00b0C, as shown by the curve returning to the x-axis.

When the concentration of CO\u2082 in the solution increases, more CO\u2082 reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083). This reaction increases the acidity of the solution, lowering its pH. Hydrogencarbonate indicator turns yellow in acidic conditions, which signify a high concentration of carbon dioxide. This is often observed in experiments measuring the rate of respiration, as respiration releases CO\u2082.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. green**\nThis is incorrect. Green is not a standard colour for hydrogencarbonate indicator. The indicator is typically red or orange at a neutral pH, which corresponds to the normal concentration of CO\u2082 in the atmosphere. An increase in carbon dioxide would create acidic conditions, not a neutral state.\n\n**B. red**\nThis is incorrect. The colour red (or orange) indicates a neutral pH. This colour is seen when the hydrogencarbonate indicator is in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide present in the normal atmosphere. The question asks about the effect of an *increased* CO\u2082 concentration, which would cause the pH to become acidic and the indicator to change from red to yellow.\n\n**C. violet**\nThis is incorrect. The colour violet (or purple) indicates alkaline (basic) conditions, which result from a *low* concentration of carbon dioxide. A low CO\u2082 level occurs when photosynthesis removes CO\u2082 from the solution, reducing the amount of carbonic acid and thus raising the pH.

Fats, also known as lipids (specifically triglycerides), are molecules made up of a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty acid chains. The enzyme lipase catalyses the hydrolysis (breakdown) of fats into their constituent parts: glycerol and fatty acids. Therefore, if glycerol is present at the end of the reaction, the substrate must have been fat, and the enzyme responsible for this breakdown is lipase.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nAmylase is a carbohydrase, an enzyme that specifically catalyses the breakdown of complex carbohydrates like starch into simpler sugars (e.g., maltose). Amylase does not act on fats because enzymes are specific, meaning their active site only fits a particular substrate. Since the product is glycerol, which results from fat digestion, amylase could not be the enzyme involved.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nAmylase is an enzyme that digests starch, not glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar (monosaccharide) and is often a final product of carbohydrate digestion, not a substrate for amylase. Furthermore, the breakdown of either starch or glucose does not yield glycerol. Glycerol is a component of fats, not carbohydrates.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nLipase is the correct enzyme for producing glycerol, but it acts on fats (lipids), not glucose.

The main food groups\u2014carbohydrates, proteins, and fats\u2014consist of large molecules (polymers) that are generally insoluble in water. This insolubility and large size prevent them from being absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream. Chemical digestion uses specific enzymes (e.g., amylase for starch, proteases for proteins) to catalyze hydrolysis reactions, which break these large, insoluble polymers into their smaller, soluble monomers (e.g., glucose, amino acids). These small, soluble molecules can then be easily absorbed and transported by the blood to the body's cells for use in respiration, growth, and repair.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis statement incorrectly describes the properties of the molecules resulting from digestion. The primary goal of chemical digestion is to produce small molecules that are soluble in water. This solubility is crucial for the nutrients to dissolve in the blood plasma and be transported throughout the body. If digestion produced small, insoluble molecules, they could not be absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream, rendering the digestive process ineffective.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis statement describes a synthesis reaction, not digestion. Digestion is a catabolic process, meaning it involves the *breakdown* of large molecules into smaller ones. The process of *building up* large molecules from smaller units is called anabolism or assimilation, which occurs inside cells after digestion and absorption are complete.

Oxygen is taken up by the blood in the lungs for use in cellular respiration, so the concentration of oxygen is higher in inspired air than in expired air.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for both gases. It wrongly claims that inspired air has less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than expired air. In reality, the opposite is true for both gases due to the process of gas exchange in the lungs, where oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is released.\n\n**D:** This option incorrectly states that inspired air has more carbon dioxide than expired air.

Therefore, its concentration is significantly lower in the air we inhale compared to the air we exhale."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_302.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "22 what is the site of gas exchange in humans?\na nose\nb alveoli\nc_ bronchus\nd_ trachea", "Chapter": 11, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**B. alveoli**\n\nThis option is correct. The alveoli are the primary sites of gas exchange in the human respiratory system. They are millions of tiny, thin-walled air sacs located at the ends of the bronchioles in the lungs. Their structure is highly adapted for this function:\n1.  **Large Surface Area:** The vast number of alveoli provides a massive total surface area (approximately 70 square metres in an adult) for gases to diffuse across.\n2.  **Short Diffusion Pathway:** The walls of the alveoli and the surrounding capillaries are each only one cell thick. This creates an extremely short distance for oxygen to diffuse from the inhaled air into the blood, and for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveolar air to be exhaled.\n3.  **Rich Blood Supply:** Each alveolus is surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, ensuring that a continuous flow of blood maintains a steep concentration gradient for oxygen and carbon dioxide, facilitating rapid and efficient diffusion.\n4.  **Moist Lining:** The inner surface of the alveoli is covered by a thin layer of fluid, which allows oxygen to dissolve before it diffuses across the membranes into the blood.\n\n***\n\n**A. nose**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The nose is part of the upper respiratory tract and functions primarily to prepare air for the lungs. Its key roles include warming, moistening, and filtering inhaled air. Hairs in the nostrils and the mucus-lined nasal passages trap dust, pollen, and other airborne particles, preventing them from reaching the delicate lung tissue. While some minimal gas exchange may occur across the moist mucous membranes, it is physiologically insignificant compared to the exchange in the lungs. The nose is a conducting passage, not the main site of gas exchange.\n\n***\n\n**C. bronchus**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The bronchi (singular: bronchus) are large air tubes that branch off from the trachea and lead into the left and right lungs. Their function is to conduct air to and from the lungs. The walls of the bronchi are relatively thick, supported by cartilage, and lined with mucus-producing cells and cilia. This structure is designed for air transport and filtration, not for efficient gas exchange. The diffusion distance is far too great for significant gas exchange to occur.\n\n***\n\n**D. trachea**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The trachea, or windpipe, is the main airway connecting the larynx (voice box) to the bronchi. Its primary function is to serve as a passageway for air to travel to the lungs. The walls of the trachea are reinforced with C-shaped rings of cartilage to prevent collapse and are lined with a mucous membrane and cilia that trap and move debris away from the lungs. Due to its thick, cartilaginous walls, the trachea is not structured for gas exchange; it is part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_303.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "23 three statements about anaerobic respiration are listed.\n1 in humans, the product is lactic acid.\n2 in yeast, the product is lactic acid.\n3. it releases more energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.\nwhich statements are correct?\na 1,2and3 b 1tand2only c 1 only d 2and 3 only", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is **C** because only statement 1 is accurate.\n\n1.  **In humans, the product is lactic acid.** This statement is **correct**. During intense exercise, the demand for energy in muscle cells can exceed the supply of oxygen. To compensate, muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. In this process, glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen to produce lactic acid and a small amount of energy (ATP). The accumulation of lactic acid is associated with muscle fatigue and soreness. The chemical equation for this process is:\n    Glucose \u2192 Lactic Acid (+ energy)\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n*   **Statement 2: In yeast, the product is lactic acid.** This statement is **incorrect**. Yeast, a single-celled fungus, undergoes a different type of anaerobic respiration called alcoholic fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, yeast breaks down glucose into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide, along with a small amount of energy. This process is utilised in baking (the carbon dioxide causes bread to rise) and brewing. The chemical equation is:\n    Glucose \u2192 Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide (+ energy)\n\n*   **Statement 3: It releases more energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.** This statement is **incorrect**. Anaerobic respiration is the incomplete breakdown of glucose and releases only a small amount of energy (a net gain of 2 ATP molecules). In contrast, aerobic respiration is the complete breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen, which is a much more efficient process, releasing a significantly larger amount of energy (approximately 30-38 ATP molecules). Therefore, anaerobic respiration releases far *less* energy per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration.\n\nSince only statement 1 is correct, options A, B, and D, which include the incorrect statements 2 and/or 3, are all incorrect."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_304.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "24 which organ produces insulin?\na adrenal gland\nb | liver\nc_oovary\nd_ pancreas", "Chapter": 14, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**D. pancreas:** The pancreas is the organ responsible for producing insulin. Within the pancreas are clusters of endocrine cells known as the Islets of Langerhans. Specifically, the beta (\u03b2) cells within these islets synthesise and secrete insulin directly into the bloodstream. Insulin is a crucial hormone that regulates blood glucose concentration. It acts by stimulating body cells, particularly those in the liver and muscles, to absorb glucose from the blood. In the liver and muscles, insulin promotes the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. adrenal gland:** The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce several hormones, but not insulin. The adrenal medulla produces adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which are involved in the 'fight or flight' response. Adrenaline actually raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen back into glucose. The adrenal cortex produces steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, which regulate metabolism, immune response, and blood pressure.\n\n**B. liver:** The liver is a vital organ in glucose metabolism but it does not produce insulin. Instead, it is a primary *target organ* for insulin. When insulin is present in the blood, it signals the liver to take up glucose and convert it into glycogen for storage. The liver also produces and secretes another hormone, glucagon (produced by the pancreas), which has the opposite effect of insulin, raising blood glucose levels by breaking down glycogen.\n\n**C. ovary:** The ovaries are the primary female reproductive organs. As endocrine glands, their main function is to produce the female sex hormones, primarily oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones are responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. The ovaries are not involved in the production of insulin or the direct regulation of blood glucose levels."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_305.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "25 the diagram shows the human excretory system.\nwhich labelled structure is the urethra?\ngo\nb\n| |\nd\nv", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nStructure D correctly identifies the urethra.

Its primary function in the excretory system is to expel urine, which has been produced by the kidneys and stored in the bladder, from the body.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** Structure A represents one of the major blood vessels associated with the kidneys, either the aorta (which gives rise to the renal artery) or the vena cava (which the renal vein drains into). These vessels transport blood to and from the kidneys for filtration. They are part of the circulatory system, not the urinary tract itself, and are therefore not the urethra.\n\n**B:** Structure B is the kidney.

It is found within the CNS (spinal cord or brain) and is characterised by its many short dendrites and a short axon. Its function is to connect the sensory neurone to the motor neurone.\n3.  **Motor Neurone (N):** The neurone labelled N is a motor neurone. It has its cell body at one end with dendrites, and a long axon that carries impulses from the CNS to an effector, such as a muscle or a gland.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence for the transmission of a nerve impulse during a reflex action is from the sensory neurone (L) to the relay neurone (M), and then to the motor neurone (N).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B.

A reflex arc is initiated by a stimulus detected by a receptor, which then sends an impulse along a sensory neurone (L) *to* the central nervous system.

It contains millions of specialized photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. While rods are responsible for vision in low light levels (scotopic vision), cones are responsible for colour vision (photopic vision) and function best in relatively bright light. There are three types of cone cells, each containing a different photopigment that is sensitive to a specific range of light wavelengths. These are broadly categorized as red-sensitive, green-sensitive, and blue-sensitive cones. When red light enters the eye and is focused onto the retina, it primarily stimulates the red-sensitive cone cells, which then convert the light energy into electrical nerve impulses.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A. cornea\n\nThe cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped outer layer at the front of the eye. Its primary function is to refract, or bend, light as it enters the eye, accounting for about two-thirds of the eye's total optical power. It also serves a protective role, shielding the eye from dust, germs, and other harmful matter. The cornea does not contain any photoreceptor cells and is therefore incapable of detecting light or colour; it only transmits and refracts it.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B. iris\n\nThe iris is the pigmented, muscular structure that gives the eye its colour. Its function is to control the size of the pupil, the opening in the centre of the iris that allows light to reach the retina. In response to light intensity, the muscles of the iris contract or relax to make the pupil smaller (constrict) or larger (dilate), thereby regulating the amount of light entering the eye. The iris controls light entry but does not contain the photoreceptor cells needed to detect light or perceive colour.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C. optic nerve\n\nThe optic nerve is a bundle of more than a million nerve fibres that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. After the photoreceptor cells in the retina detect light and convert it into electrical signals, these signals are processed by other retinal neurons and then transmitted as nerve impulses along the optic nerve. The brain's visual cortex then interprets these impulses as images. The optic nerve is a crucial pathway for transmitting information, but it does not perform the initial detection of light.

The acrosome is a specialised vesicle that contains hydrolytic enzymes, such as hyaluronidase and acrosin. During fertilization, when the sperm cell reaches the egg, the acrosome releases these enzymes. This process, known as the acrosome reaction, digests the protective outer layers of the egg cell (the zona pellucida), allowing the sperm to penetrate and fuse with the egg cell membrane.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nStructure B is the nucleus. The nucleus contains the male's genetic material in the form of 23 chromosomes (a haploid set). Its function is to deliver this genetic information to the egg cell. After the acrosome has digested the egg's outer layers, the sperm and egg membranes fuse, and the sperm's nucleus enters the egg's cytoplasm to combine with the egg's nucleus, forming a diploid zygote. The nucleus does not contain digestive enzymes and is not involved in penetrating the egg.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nStructure C represents the mitochondria, which are located in the middle piece of the sperm cell. The primary function of mitochondria is to carry out aerobic respiration to produce large quantities of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This ATP provides the necessary energy to power the movement of the tail, enabling the sperm to swim towards the egg. The mitochondria are not involved in the digestion of the egg cell membrane.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nStructure D is the tail, also known as the flagellum. The function of the tail is motility. It performs whip-like movements, propelled by the energy supplied by the mitochondria, which allows the sperm to travel through the female reproductive tract to reach the egg. The tail is essential for movement but plays no role in the enzymatic digestion of the egg's outer layers."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_309.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "29 which diseases can be successfully treated with antibiotics?\n\ndiseases diseases\n\ncaused by rickets caused by\n\nbacteria viruses\na jv jv jv key\nb v x x / =can be treated\ncc x v x x = cannot be treated\nd x x v", "Chapter": 10, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nAntibiotics are a class of antimicrobial drugs used to treat infections caused by bacteria.

The height of each bar represents the number of individuals (frequency) within a specific range of heights (class interval). The most frequent height range, also known as the modal class, is the class interval with the highest frequency. By observing the histogram, the tallest bar corresponds to the height range of 160\u2013164 cm. This bar reaches a frequency of 20 on the y-axis, which is the highest value among all the bars. Therefore, the most frequent height range for students in this class is 160\u2013164 cm.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n**A: There are two students who are 147 cm tall.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A histogram shows data grouped into class intervals. It indicates the number of individuals that fall within a certain range, but it does not provide information about the specific measurement of any single individual. For the height range of 145\u2013149 cm, the bar has a height of zero, meaning there are no students in this height range at all. Consequently, it is impossible for any student to be 147 cm tall.\n\n**C: The range of student heights measured is 150\u2013174 cm.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The range of a dataset refers to the spread of all its values. The histogram shows that measurements were taken for students in height ranges from 140\u2013144 cm up to 180\u2013184 cm. There are students recorded in the 140\u2013144 cm class interval and in the 180\u2013184 cm class interval. Therefore, the full extent of the measured heights is from 140 cm to 184 cm, which is wider than the 150\u2013174 cm suggested.\n\n**D: There are 72 students in this study.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect.

During this process, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil. Using light energy, they convert these inorganic molecules into glucose (an organic compound used for energy and growth) and release oxygen as a byproduct. Because carbon dioxide is a key reactant that is consumed and locked into organic matter, photosynthesis is the primary natural process that decreases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) combustion**\nCombustion is the process of burning, which involves a rapid reaction between a substance with an oxidant, usually oxygen, to produce heat and light. The burning of organic materials, such as wood, and fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, releases large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Therefore, combustion is a major process that *increases* the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, rather than decreasing it.\n\n**B) decomposition**\nDecomposition is the process by which dead organic substances are broken down into simpler organic or inorganic matter. This is carried out by decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi. These microorganisms respire, and in doing so, they break down the complex carbon compounds in the dead organic matter and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a waste product. Thus, decomposition *increases* the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\n**D) respiration**\nCellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of nearly all living organisms, including plants and animals. During respiration, organisms break down organic molecules (like glucose) to release energy for their life processes. A key waste product of this reaction is carbon dioxide, which is then released into the environment. Consequently, respiration is a process that continually adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, thereby *increasing* its concentration."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_317.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "37 it is estimated that 90% of the energy which flows through living organisms in a food chain is lost\nbetween one trophic level and the next.\nthe producers in a food chain contain 1000 units of energy.\nhow many units will reach the quaternary consumers in the food chain?\na 0.1 units\nb 1 unit\nc 10 units\nd100 units", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe transfer of energy between trophic levels in a food chain is inefficient.

The removal of trees destroys these habitats, leading to a loss of food sources, shelter, and breeding grounds for many organisms. This habitat destruction can cause a sharp decline in species populations, increasing the risk of extinction for those unable to adapt or relocate.\n\n2.  **Increase in Flooding:** Trees play a crucial role in the water cycle. Their canopies intercept rainfall, reducing the amount and speed of water reaching the ground. Their extensive root systems bind the soil, increasing its stability and capacity to absorb water. When forests are cleared, more rainwater hits the ground directly and runs off the surface, as the soil is less able to absorb it. This increased surface runoff can overwhelm rivers and streams, leading to a higher frequency and severity of flooding.\n\nBecause deforestation increases both extinctions and the risk of flooding, this option is correct.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. 1, 2 and 3:** This option is incorrect because deforestation causes a **decrease**, not an increase, in biodiversity.

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential across a selectively permeable membrane.\n\n1.  **Water Potential Gradient:** The pure water inside the potato cavity has a higher water potential (less negative) compared to the concentrated sugar solution in the glass dish, which has a lower water potential (more negative) due to the dissolved sugar solutes.\n2.  **Selectively Permeable Membrane:** The living cells of the potato tissue act as a selectively permeable membrane, allowing water molecules to pass through but restricting the movement of larger sugar molecules.\n3.  **Net Movement of Water:** Due to the water potential gradient, there will be a net movement of water molecules from the inside of the potato cavity, through the potato tissue, and into the concentrated sugar solution in the dish.\n4.  **Resulting Volume Changes:** This movement of water out of the potato cavity causes its volume to decrease.

It suggests that the volumes of both the water and the sugar solution increase. This is impossible as it would violate the principle of conservation of matter; water cannot be created in the system. For the volume of water inside the potato to increase, water would have to move from the sugar solution into the potato. This would only occur if the sugar solution had a higher water potential than the fluid inside the potato, which is contrary to the experimental setup where pure water (high water potential) is inside and a concentrated sugar solution (low water potential) is outside. Furthermore, if water moved out of the sugar solution, its volume would decrease, not increase.\n\n---\n### Explanation for the incorrect answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the volume of water increases while the volume of the sugar solution remains the same. Firstly, for the volume of water inside the potato to increase, water must move from the sugar solution into the potato. This movement would be against the established water potential gradient. Secondly, if water were to move from the sugar solution, the volume of the solution would necessarily decrease; it could not remain the same. The presence of a water potential gradient between the pure water and the concentrated sugar solution ensures that osmosis will occur, leading to a change in the volumes of both liquids.\n\n---\n### Explanation for the incorrect answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect. It suggests the volume of water remains the same and the volume of the sugar solution decreases. The volume of water would only remain the same if there were no net movement of water, which would happen only if the solutions on both sides of the potato tissue were isotonic (had the same water potential). This is not the case, as pure water and a concentrated sugar solution have very different water potentials. Additionally, for the volume of the sugar solution to decrease, water would have to move out of it and into the potato, which is against the water potential gradient. The net movement of water will always be from the region of higher water potential (the water in the potato) to the region of lower water potential (the sugar solution)."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_327.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "7 which process causes oxygen to pass from an alveolus in the lung into a blood capillary?\na assimilation\nb diffusion\nc_ excretion\nd_ osmosis", "Chapter": 13, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe movement of oxygen from the alveoli into the blood capillaries is a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Following inhalation, the air in the alveoli has a high concentration (high partial pressure) of oxygen. In contrast, the blood arriving at the lungs from the body tissues has a low concentration of oxygen because it has been used for cellular respiration. This difference in concentration creates a steep concentration gradient, causing oxygen molecules to move passively across the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries into the blood.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. assimilation:** Assimilation is the process by which absorbed and digested food products are converted into the complex components of cells and tissues. For instance, amino acids are assimilated to synthesise new proteins. This process occurs within the body's cells after nutrients have been transported by the blood, and it is not involved in the transport of gases into the bloodstream.\n\n**C. excretion:** Excretion is the process of removing metabolic waste products (such as urea and carbon dioxide) and excess substances from an organism. While the removal of carbon dioxide from the blood into the alveoli is an example of excretion via the lungs, the uptake of oxygen into the blood is not. Oxygen is an essential substance required for respiration, not a waste product.\n\n**D. osmosis:** Osmosis is the specific term for the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.

The defining feature of an amino acid is the presence of an amino group (-NH\u2082), which makes nitrogen an essential element in all proteins. Furthermore, hydrogen is abundant in the structure of every amino acid, found in the amino group, the carboxyl group, and attached to the carbon backbone.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect because it states that carbon is absent. Proteins are organic molecules, which by definition are based on carbon atoms. Carbon forms the fundamental skeleton of every amino acid, including the central alpha-carbon, the carbon in the carboxyl group, and the backbone of the R-group side chain.

This structure is maintained by weak chemical bonds, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds. Denaturation is the process where these bonds are broken, causing the enzyme to lose its specific shape, particularly that of the active site. This change is typically irreversible and results in a loss of catalytic activity.\n\n1.  **Change in pH:** Every enzyme operates most effectively at a specific optimal pH. If the pH becomes too acidic or too alkaline relative to this optimum, the concentration of H\u207a and OH\u207b ions changes. These ions can interfere with and disrupt the ionic and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme in its precise shape. This disruption alters the shape of the active site, leading to denaturation.\n\n2.  **Change in temperature:** Enzymes also have an optimal temperature. At temperatures significantly above this optimum, the atoms within the enzyme molecule gain excessive kinetic energy and vibrate vigorously. This vibration is strong enough to break the weak hydrogen bonds maintaining the enzyme's tertiary structure. Consequently, the enzyme unfolds, the active site changes shape, and the enzyme denatures.\n\nTherefore, both a significant change in pH and a significant change in temperature can cause an enzyme to denature.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 1, 2 and 3**\nThis option is incorrect because a change in substrate concentration does not cause an enzyme to denature. While changes in pH (1) and temperature (2) disrupt the chemical bonds that maintain the enzyme's structure, a change in substrate concentration (3) only affects the rate of the reaction. Increasing substrate concentration increases the reaction rate up to a saturation point where all enzyme active sites are occupied. It does not, however, alter the physical structure of the enzyme molecule.\n\n**C: 1 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it omits the effect of temperature. High temperatures are a primary cause of enzyme denaturation. The increased kinetic energy at high temperatures breaks the weak bonds holding the enzyme's tertiary structure together, irreversibly changing the shape of the active site. While a change in pH (1) does cause denaturation, a change in substrate concentration (3) does not.\n\n**D: 2 and 3 only**\nThis option is incorrect because it omits the effect of pH. Extreme changes in pH, away from the enzyme's optimum, disrupt the ionic bonds that are crucial for maintaining the specific three-dimensional shape of the enzyme.

Two key features facilitate this:\n\n1.  **A large number of stomata:** Stomata are small pores on the leaf surface that act as the primary entry point for carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A higher density of stomata increases the total surface area available for gas exchange, allowing more carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf's internal air spaces.\n2.  **A thin leaf:** Carbon dioxide must diffuse from the air spaces within the leaf to the palisade cells. A thin leaf structure reduces the length of this diffusion pathway. According to the principles of diffusion, a shorter distance allows for a faster rate of movement of molecules down a concentration gradient.\n\nTherefore, the combination of **many stomata** and a **thin leaf** is the most effective adaptation for allowing more carbon dioxide to diffuse into the palisade cells for photosynthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: few stomata, thick leaf**\nThis combination is the least effective for carbon dioxide diffusion. Having few stomata severely limits the amount of CO\u2082 that can enter the leaf from the atmosphere. A thick leaf increases the diffusion distance from the stomata to the palisade cells, which significantly slows down the rate at which CO\u2082 can reach the sites of photosynthesis.\n\n**B: few stomata, thin leaf**\nWhile a thin leaf provides a short diffusion pathway, which is advantageous, having only a few stomata creates a bottleneck. This limits the initial uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, meaning there is less CO\u2082 available to diffuse to the palisade cells, regardless of the short distance.\n\n**C: many stomata, thick leaf**\nAlthough having many stomata allows for a high rate of carbon dioxide entry into the leaf, a thick leaf structure creates a long diffusion pathway.

This process occurs in the chloroplasts. A key byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082. The oxygen produced diffuses out of the cell, creating a region of high oxygen concentration in the immediate vicinity. Since the bacteria are described as moving to areas of high oxygen concentration, it is the oxygen produced during photosynthesis that attracts them, causing them to cluster around the photosynthesising cell.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A - Digestion:**\nDigestion is the enzymatic breakdown of large, complex food molecules into smaller, soluble ones. This process does not produce oxygen. In fact, the energy required for such cellular processes is released through respiration, which consumes oxygen. Therefore, digestion cannot be the cause of the high oxygen concentration attracting the bacteria.\n\n**C - Reproduction:**\nCellular reproduction, such as mitosis, is the process by which a cell divides to produce new cells. This is essential for growth and repair. The process involves the replication of genetic material and the division of the cytoplasm, but it does not produce oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n**D - Respiration:**\nCellular respiration is the process that releases energy from glucose. In aerobic respiration, which occurs in the presence of oxygen, glucose is broken down to release energy, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Crucially, aerobic respiration *consumes* oxygen rather than producing it (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082 \u2192 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O).

Therefore, the enzyme amylase digests the starch coating, producing simple reducing sugars as the final product.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option correctly identifies amylase as the enzyme that digests starch.

Once in the leaf, water moves into the mesophyll cells. The spongy mesophyll layer consists of irregularly shaped cells with large air spaces between them. Water coats the surfaces of these cells. The change of state from liquid water to water vapour (evaporation) primarily occurs from the moist surfaces of these spongy mesophyll cells into the adjacent air spaces. This significantly increases the concentration of water vapour within the leaf, creating a steep water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the drier air outside, which drives the diffusion of water vapour out through the stomata. The large collective surface area of the spongy mesophyll cells facilitates a high rate of evaporation, accounting for the vast majority of water lost during transpiration.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n**A: the cuticle**\nThe cuticle is a waxy, waterproof layer that covers the epidermis of the leaf. Its primary function is to prevent uncontrolled water loss from the leaf surface. Because the cuticle is largely impermeable to water, only a very small amount of water can evaporate directly through it. Therefore, it is not the site where most water evaporates.\n\n**B: the guard cells**\nGuard cells are specialised cells that surround the stomatal pores. Their function is to regulate the size of these pores, controlling the rate of gas exchange and water loss from the leaf. While they contain water, their primary role in transpiration is regulatory; they control the exit of water vapour from the leaf. The actual evaporation of liquid water into water vapour occurs on the surface of the mesophyll cells inside the leaf, not on the guard cells themselves.\n\n**D: the xylem vessels**\nXylem vessels are part of the plant's vascular tissue and function as water-conducting tubes, transporting water from the roots up to the leaves. They are the delivery system for water within the leaf. Water must move out of the xylem vessels and into the surrounding mesophyll cells before it can evaporate.

They function by opening to allow blood to pass through in the correct direction and closing to prevent it from flowing backward (backflow or regurgitation). In the heart, valves are positioned between the atria and ventricles, and at the exit of the ventricles into the major arteries. In the veins, particularly those in the limbs, valves work against gravity to ensure blood returns to the heart. This passive opening and closing mechanism, driven by pressure differences, is the primary reason blood circulates in a single, continuous direction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) capillaries**\nCapillaries are the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system, with walls that are only one cell thick. Their primary function is not to direct blood flow but to serve as the site for the exchange of substances, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste products, between the blood and the body's tissues. While blood flows through them from arterioles to venules due to the pressure gradient created by the heart, capillaries themselves do not possess any mechanism to prevent backflow.\n\n**B) muscles**\nMuscles play a role in moving blood but do not, by themselves, ensure it flows in one direction. The cardiac muscle of the heart acts as a pump, creating the pressure that drives blood circulation. Skeletal muscles, especially in the legs, contract and squeeze adjacent veins, helping to push blood towards the heart (this is known as the skeletal muscle pump). However, this muscular action would be ineffective without valves within the veins to prevent the blood from being pushed backward. Therefore, while muscles provide the force, it is the valves that guarantee the one-way direction of the flow.\n\n**D) ventricles**\nThe ventricles are the two lower, muscular chambers of the heart. Their powerful contractions are responsible for pumping blood out of the heart and into the arteries. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body. While the ventricles generate the essential pressure for blood circulation, they do not prevent backflow. This function is carried out by the heart valves. The atrioventricular valves prevent blood from flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract, and the semilunar valves prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles when they relax."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_339.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 in which row is the component of blood correctly linked to its function?\n[| bod component | tarcion |\na plasma transport of carbon dioxide\nb platelets phagocytosis\ncc red blood cells antibody production\nd white blood cells blood clotting", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nBlood plasma is the liquid component of blood that functions as a transport medium.

This statement accurately and completely describes the fundamental characteristic of a transmissible disease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. a disease caused when a pathogen passes through a host's body**\nThis statement is incorrect because it is too general and does not capture the defining feature of a transmissible disease. While a pathogen does enter and move within a host's body to cause illness, the term \"transmissible\" specifically refers to the ability of the pathogen to be passed *from one host to another*. Many non-pathogenic microbes can also pass through a host's body without causing disease. The key concept is the spread between individuals, not simply the presence of a pathogen within a single individual.\n\n**C. a disease caused when a pathogen passes to the host's body only by direct contact**\nThis statement is incorrect because it is too restrictive. While direct contact (e.g., touching an infected person) is one method of transmission, it is not the only one. Transmissible diseases can also be spread by indirect means, such as through airborne droplets (e.g., influenza), contaminated water or food (e.g., cholera), or via vectors like insects (e.g., malaria). A transmissible disease is one that can be passed from host to host by any means, not exclusively by direct contact.\n\n**D. a disease caused when a pathogen passes to the host's body only by indirect contact**\nThis statement is incorrect because it is also too restrictive.

This carbon dioxide is transported by the blood to the lungs. In the alveoli, it diffuses from the blood into the air due to a concentration gradient. Consequently, expired air has a significantly higher concentration of carbon dioxide than inspired air.\n*   **Oxygen:** Oxygen is essential for aerobic cellular respiration. When air is inspired into the lungs, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the bloodstream to be transported to the body's cells. This uptake of oxygen by the blood means that the air which is subsequently expired contains a lower concentration of oxygen.\n*   **Water Vapour:** The surfaces of the respiratory tract, particularly the alveoli, are moist to facilitate gas exchange. As inspired air, which is often drier, passes over these surfaces, it becomes warmed and saturated with water vapour. Therefore, expired air contains a higher concentration of water vapour than inspired air.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) carbon dioxide: decreased, oxygen: increased, water vapour: increased**\nThis option is incorrect because the concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen are reversed.

This type of respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen and releases a small amount of energy from the glucose molecule for the yeast cell to use. This process is also referred to as alcoholic fermentation.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** This statement is incorrect. In bread-making, the rising of the dough is caused by the bubbles of carbon dioxide gas produced by the yeast during anaerobic respiration. These gas bubbles become trapped within the dough's gluten structure, causing it to expand and rise. The alcohol produced is a by-product that largely evaporates during the baking process.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect. Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a fully oxidised molecule and is not flammable; therefore, it cannot be burnt as a fuel. In fact, it is used in some fire extinguishers to displace oxygen and put out fires. The alcohol (ethanol) produced during this process can be used as a biofuel, but the carbon dioxide cannot.\n\n**C:** This statement is incorrect.

Yeast, a single-celled fungus, uses sugar (glucose) as a respiratory substrate. In a warm environment and in the absence of oxygen, yeast enzymes catalyse the breakdown of sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide gas. This process is known as fermentation. The equation for this reaction is:\n\nGlucose \u2192 Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Energy\nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 \u2192 2C\u2082H\u2085OH + 2CO\u2082\n\nThe carbon dioxide gas produced cannot escape the bottle and will accumulate, causing the balloon on bottle P to inflate.\n\nSetup Q acts as a control for the experiment. It contains yeast and water but lacks the sugar substrate. Without a food source to break down, the yeast cannot perform significant respiration. Therefore, no carbon dioxide gas is produced, and the balloon on bottle Q remains deflated. This demonstrates that sugar is essential for the process of anaerobic respiration in yeast.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it suggests that the balloon on bottle Q inflates. Anaerobic respiration requires a respiratory substrate, which is sugar in this experiment. Since bottle Q contains no sugar, the yeast has no food source to metabolise, and thus, no significant amount of carbon dioxide can be produced to inflate the balloon.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it suggests that no reaction occurs in either bottle. Bottle P contains yeast, sugar, and water in a warm room, which are the ideal conditions for anaerobic respiration. This process releases carbon dioxide gas, which would cause the balloon on bottle P to inflate. Therefore, it is incorrect to show balloon P as deflated.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it shows the opposite of the expected outcome. It suggests that respiration occurs in the absence of sugar (bottle Q) but not in its presence (bottle P). Sugar is the essential substrate for yeast to carry out respiration.

Their function is to filter the blood and produce urine, thereby removing metabolic wastes, toxic substances, and substances present in excess of the body's needs. This process includes osmoregulation, which is the regulation of the water potential of the blood. The kidneys achieve this by controlling the amount of water and mineral ions reabsorbed back into the blood. Any excess mineral ions are removed from the body in the urine. Therefore, the excretion of ions is a crucial function of the kidney to maintain homeostasis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The bladder is an organ of the urinary system responsible for the temporary storage of urine produced by the kidneys. It does not perform excretion, which is the process of removing waste products from the blood. While water is a major component of urine and is excreted from the body, the bladder's role is storage, not the formation of urine or the removal of substances from the bloodstream.\n\n**C:** The lungs are indeed excretory organs, but they excrete carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, along with some water vapour. Oxygen, conversely, is taken into the body via the lungs during inhalation and is required for cellular respiration. As an essential reactant in this metabolic process, oxygen is not a waste product and is therefore not excreted by the body.\n\n**D:** The urethra is a duct that transports urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. It is involved in the elimination of urine (a process called micturition) but is not considered an excretory organ. Excretion is the process of removing waste from the body's internal environment (e.g., the blood), a function performed by the kidneys when they produce urine.

The convention is to use a capital letter for the dominant allele and a lowercase letter for the recessive allele. A dominant allele is one that expresses its corresponding trait even when only one copy is present in the genotype (e.g., in a heterozygous organism, Tt). The trait associated with the dominant allele will be the one observed in the organism's phenotype. Therefore, 'T' represents a dominant allele.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. a dominant chromosome**\nThis is incorrect. An allele ('T') is a specific version of a gene, which is a segment of DNA. A chromosome is a much larger structure composed of tightly coiled DNA that contains many genes. The terms dominant and recessive describe the relationship between alleles of a single gene, not entire chromosomes. The concept of a \"dominant chromosome\" is not used in Mendelian genetics.\n\n**C. a recessive allele**\nThis is incorrect. A recessive allele is an allele that only expresses its trait when two copies are present (e.g., in a homozygous recessive organism, tt). By convention, recessive alleles are represented by a lowercase letter (in this case, 't'). The capital letter 'T' is used to denote the dominant allele.\n\n**D. a recessive chromosome**\nThis is incorrect. As with option B, 'T' represents an allele, not a chromosome.

This variation can be either continuous or discontinuous.\n\n**Continuous variation** is characterised by a complete and unbroken range of measurements from one extreme to the other. There are no distinct categories, and individuals can fall anywhere along a continuum. This type of variation is typically controlled by multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) and is often significantly influenced by environmental factors.\n\n*   **Body mass (2)** is an example of continuous variation. In a population, body mass does not fall into a few discrete categories but rather shows a full range of values. It is influenced by many genes and also by environmental factors such as diet and exercise.\n*   **Height (3)** is another classic example of continuous variation. Individuals are not just 'tall' or 'short'; their height can be any value within a certain range. Like body mass, height is a polygenic trait and is affected by environmental factors, particularly nutrition.\n\nSince both body mass and height exhibit a continuous range of phenotypes, they are examples of continuous variation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. 1, 2 and 3**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes blood group (1), which is not an example of continuous variation. Blood group is an example of **discontinuous variation**, where individuals fall into distinct, separate categories (A, B, AB, or O). There are no intermediate blood groups. This trait is controlled by a single gene with multiple alleles and is not influenced by the environment.\n\n**C. 2 and 4**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes seed colour in peas (4), which is an example of discontinuous variation. Pea seeds have distinct colours, such as yellow or green, with no intermediate shades. This trait is controlled by a single gene, a classic example of Mendelian genetics, demonstrating discontinuous variation.\n\n**D. 3 and 4**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes seed colour in peas (4).

In the context of a food chain, the arrow indicates the direction of energy flow. Energy, stored as chemical energy in the organic compounds of the lettuce plant (the producer), is transferred to the slug (the primary consumer) when the slug eats, or ingests, the plant. This is the first step in making the energy from the producer available to the consumer.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. egestion**\n\nEgestion is the process of discharging undigested or unabsorbed food from the body as faeces. This process deals with material that was ingested but could not be broken down and absorbed. Therefore, egestion represents energy that is *not* transferred and assimilated by the organism, but is instead removed as waste.\n\n**B. excretion**\n\nExcretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from an organism. These wastes, such as carbon dioxide from respiration or urea from protein breakdown, are by-products of chemical reactions within the body's cells. Excretion is a process that removes waste after nutrients have been metabolised, not the process of acquiring energy from a food source.\n\n**D. respiration**\n\nRespiration is the set of metabolic reactions that occur in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used to power cellular activities. While respiration releases the energy *from* the ingested food for the slug to use, it is not the process by which the energy is transferred *from* the lettuce plant *to* the slug.

The base of the pyramid always represents the producers, with successive trophic levels stacked on top. The width of each block is proportional to the number of organisms at that level.\n\nIn this specific food chain:\n1.  **Producer:** There is \"a single bush\". This forms the base of the pyramid and, being only one organism, is represented by a very narrow block.\n2.  **Primary Consumer:** There is a \"large population of greenfly\" feeding on the bush. This second trophic level has a very large number of individuals, so it is represented by a very wide block.\n3.  **Secondary Consumer:** There are \"several ladybirds\" that eat the greenfly. The number of ladybirds is significantly less than the number of greenfly, but more than the single bush. This third level is represented by a block that is narrower than the greenfly block but wider than the bush block.\n4.  **Tertiary Consumer:** The ladybirds are eaten by \"a bird\". This top trophic level consists of a single organism, represented by a very narrow block, similar in width to the producer block.\n\nThis combination of numbers\u2014small, very large, smaller, and small\u2014creates a spindle-shaped or partially inverted pyramid, as shown in diagram B.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This diagram shows a standard upright pyramid, where the number of organisms decreases at each successive trophic level. This would be incorrect for this food chain because the number of producers (one bush) is far smaller than the number of primary consumers (many greenfly), so the base of the pyramid should be the narrowest or one of the narrowest blocks, not the widest.\n\n**C:** This diagram shows a fully inverted pyramid, where the number of organisms consistently increases at each higher trophic level. This does not represent the given food chain, as the number of organisms increases from the bush to the greenfly but then decreases from the greenfly to the ladybirds and then to the bird.\n\n**D:** This diagram shows a pyramid with a wide base, narrowing middle levels, and a wide top. This is incorrect because the base should be narrow to represent the single bush.

The value at 360 days is 300 kg per hectare.\n2.  **Determine the potassium uptake at 30 days:** Locate '30' on the x-axis. This point is halfway between 0 and 60. Follow the vertical line up to the corresponding data point. Read the value on the y-axis. Each small square on the y-axis represents 5 kg per hectare (50 kg / 10 squares).

Limewater (calcium hydroxide solution) is an indicator for carbon dioxide; it turns from clear to cloudy/milky in the presence of CO\u2082 due to the formation of a white precipitate, calcium carbonate.\n\nWhen a person inhales through the mouthpiece, atmospheric air is drawn into the apparatus. The design of the tubing directs this inhaled air to bubble through the limewater in tube X. Atmospheric air contains a very low concentration of carbon dioxide (approximately 0.04%). This amount is insufficient to cause a visible change in the limewater over a short duration. Therefore, the limewater in tube X will remain clear.\n\nWhen a person exhales into the mouthpiece, the expired air from their lungs is directed to bubble through the limewater in tube Y. Exhaled air is a product of cellular respiration, a process that releases energy in cells and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. Consequently, exhaled air has a much higher concentration of carbon dioxide (approximately 4%) compared to inhaled air. This high concentration of CO\u2082 reacts readily with the limewater in tube Y, forming a significant amount of calcium carbonate precipitate and causing the solution to become cloudy.\n\nThus, after one minute of breathing, tube X (testing inhaled air) will be clear, and tube Y (testing exhaled air) will be cloudy.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: tube X - clear, tube Y - clear**\nThis option is incorrect because it fails to account for the high concentration of carbon dioxide in exhaled air. While the limewater in tube X correctly remains clear due to the low CO\u2082 in inhaled air, the limewater in tube Y would turn cloudy because exhaled air is rich in CO\u2082 from cellular respiration.\n\n**C: tube X - cloudy, tube Y - clear**\nThis option is incorrect as it reverses the expected results. It suggests that inhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than exhaled air, which is biologically false. Respiration adds carbon dioxide to the air that is breathed out, so exhaled air will always have a higher concentration of CO\u2082 than the inhaled atmospheric air.\n\n**D: tube X - cloudy, tube Y - cloudy**\nThis option is incorrect because it overestimates the effect of carbon dioxide in inhaled air. Although atmospheric air does contain some CO\u2082, its concentration (~0.04%) is too low to cause a noticeable reaction with limewater in a short time. Only the much higher concentration of CO\u2082 in exhaled air (~4%) is sufficient to make the limewater in tube Y cloudy."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_360.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "40 the diagram shows the flow of energy in an ecosystem.\nrespiration\neat an\ndeath\nwhich row correctly completes boxes 1, 2 and 3?\na ee ee\na herbivore carnivore decomposer\nb carnivore herbivore decomposer\nc decomposer carnivore herbivore\nd carnivore decomposer herbivore\npermission to reproduce items where third-party owned material protected by copyright is included has been sought and cleared where possible. every\nreasonable effort has been made by the publisher (ucles) to trace copyright holders, but if any items requiring clearance have unwittingly been included, the\npublisher will be pleased to make amends at the earliest possible opportunity.\nto avoid the issue of disclosure of answer-related information to candidates, all copyright acknowledgements are reproduced online in the cambridge\nassessment international education copyright acknowledgements booklet. this is produced for each series of examinations and is freely available to download\nat www.cambridgeinternational.org after the live examination series.\ncambridge assessment international education is part of cambridge assessment. cambridge assessment is the brand name of the university of cambridge\nlocal examinations syndicate (ucles), which is a department of the university of cambridge.", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe diagram illustrates the flow of energy through different trophic levels in an ecosystem.\n1.  **Producer:** This is the first trophic level, typically a plant, which captures energy from the Sun via photosynthesis.\n2.  **Box 1 (Primary Consumer):** The arrow from the producer points to box 1, indicating that this organism consumes the producer for energy. An organism that feeds on producers is called a primary consumer or a **herbivore**.\n3.  **Box 2 (Secondary Consumer):** The arrow from box 1 points to box 2, showing that this organism obtains energy by consuming the organism in box 1. An organism that feeds on a primary consumer (a herbivore) is a secondary consumer, which is a type of **carnivore**.\n4.  **Box 3 (Decomposer):** Arrows from the 'death' of the producer, primary consumer (box 1), and secondary consumer (box 2) all lead to box 3.

Box 1 represents a primary consumer that feeds on producers; this is a herbivore, not a carnivore. A carnivore feeds on other animals.

This creates a water potential gradient. Pure water has the highest possible water potential (zero), while the cell sap has a lower (more negative) water potential due to dissolved solutes. Consequently, water moves by osmosis from the region of higher water potential (pure water) to the region of lower water potential (the cell) across the partially permeable cell membrane.\n\nAs water enters the cell, the large central vacuole swells and pushes the cytoplasm and cell membrane against the strong, rigid cellulose cell wall. The cell becomes swollen and firm, a state known as turgid. The inelastic cell wall prevents the cell from expanding indefinitely and bursting. This internal pressure exerted by the cell contents against the cell wall is called turgor pressure. Diagram D accurately illustrates this turgid state, with the cell membrane pressed firmly against the cell wall.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis diagram depicts an animal cell, not a plant cell. The key distinguishing feature is the absence of a rigid, regularly shaped cell wall. Plant cells possess a distinct cell wall outside the cell membrane. While an animal cell would also take in water by osmosis when placed in a hypotonic solution like pure water, it would swell and eventually burst (undergo lysis) because it lacks a cell wall to withstand the increasing internal pressure.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis diagram shows a plasmolysed cell. Plasmolysis is the process where the cell membrane and cytoplasm shrink and pull away from the cell wall. This occurs when a plant cell loses water by osmosis. Water moves out of the cell when it is placed in a solution with a lower water potential than the cell sap (a hypertonic solution), such as concentrated salt or sugar solution. This is the opposite of the effect observed when a plant cell is placed in pure water.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis diagram illustrates a flaccid plant cell. In a flaccid state, the cell has lost some water, and the cell membrane is not pressed tightly against the cell wall. The cell is neither swollen nor shrunken. This condition typically occurs when a plant cell is in an isotonic solution, where the water potential inside and outside the cell is equal, resulting in no net movement of water.

The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the diffusion distance; as the distance increases, the time taken for particles to travel across that distance also increases, thereby decreasing the overall rate of diffusion. The cell wall is the outermost layer in plant, fungal, and bacterial cells, and molecules must pass through it to reach the cell surface membrane.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **A:** A greater concentration gradient would lead to an *increase* in the diffusion rate. The concentration gradient is the difference in the concentration of a substance between two areas. A steeper gradient provides a stronger net driving force for particles to move from the area of higher concentration to the area of lower concentration, resulting in a faster rate of diffusion.\n*   **B:** A higher temperature would lead to an *increase* in the diffusion rate. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. At higher temperatures, particles possess more kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and randomly. This increased movement accelerates the process of spreading out, thus increasing the rate of diffusion.\n*   **C:** A larger surface area of the cell would lead to an *increase* in the diffusion rate.

The intensity of light from a source follows the inverse square law, which states that intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (Intensity \u221d 1/d\u00b2).\n\nIn this experiment, test-tube P is 20 cm from the light source, while test-tube Q is 10 cm from the light source. Since test-tube Q is at half the distance of test-tube P, the light intensity it receives will be four times greater (as 1/(10\u00b2) is four times 1/(20\u00b2), or intensity increases by a factor of (20/10)\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 = 4).\n\nAssuming light is the limiting factor, the rate of photosynthesis (measured by the number of bubbles produced) is directly proportional to the light intensity. The rate of bubble production in test-tube P is 12 bubbles per minute. Therefore, the expected rate in test-tube Q, which receives four times the light intensity, will be four times greater.\n\nCalculation: 12 bubbles/minute \u00d7 4 = 48 bubbles/minute.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A) 0**\nThis option is incorrect. A result of 0 bubbles would indicate that photosynthesis has completely stopped. Moving the aquatic plant closer to the light source increases the light intensity, which should *increase* the rate of photosynthesis, not halt it. Photosynthesis would only cease in the absence of a key requirement, such as light.\n\n**B) 3**\nThis option is incorrect. Moving the aquatic plant from 20 cm to 10 cm away from the light source increases the light intensity it receives. An increase in light intensity, a key reactant for photosynthesis, leads to a higher rate of reaction. A value of 3 bubbles per minute would signify a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis, which contradicts the established principles of how limiting factors affect this process.\n\n**C) 12**\nThis option is incorrect. A rate of 12 bubbles per minute would imply that changing the distance from the light source had no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. This would only be possible if light intensity was not the limiting factor (i.e., another factor, such as carbon dioxide concentration or temperature, was already limiting the rate to a maximum of 12 bubbles per minute). However, given the significant change in distance, it is expected that light intensity is the primary limiting factor being tested, and thus the rate should change."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_373.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "13 which human teeth are used for biting and cutting food?\na canines and molars\nb incisors and canines\nc_ molars and premolars\nd premolars and incisors", "Chapter": 7, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nHuman dentition is specialized, with different types of teeth adapted for specific functions in the mechanical digestion of food.

Inside the leaf, the air spaces surrounding the spongy mesophyll cells are saturated with water vapour due to evaporation from the surfaces of these cells. This creates a high concentration of water vapour (or a high water potential) within the leaf. Typically, the air outside the leaf has a lower concentration of water vapour. This difference establishes a concentration gradient, causing water vapour molecules to move passively from the area of high concentration (inside the leaf) to the area of low concentration (outside the leaf) through small pores called stomata. This net movement of particles down a concentration gradient is the definition of diffusion.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. active transport**\n\n**Explanation:** Active transport is the movement of substances across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, i.e., against a concentration gradient. This process requires metabolic energy in the form of ATP and involves specific carrier proteins. The loss of water vapour from a leaf is a passive process that occurs down a concentration gradient and does not require the plant to expend energy. Therefore, it is not active transport.\n\n**C. osmosis**\n\n**Explanation:** Osmosis is a specific type of diffusion involving the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. While osmosis is vital for the movement of water between plant cells (e.g., from the xylem into mesophyll cells), the final step of water loss from the leaf is not osmosis. This is because the water is lost as a gas (water vapour) and it moves from the air spaces within the leaf, through the stomatal pore, into the atmosphere, which does not involve movement across a partially permeable membrane.\n\n**D. photosynthesis**\n\n**Explanation:** Photosynthesis is the chemical process by which plants produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water, using light energy. Water is a raw material (a reactant) that is consumed during photosynthesis. It is not a process by which water vapour is lost. Although the stomata, which allow water vapour to exit, also allow carbon dioxide to enter for photosynthesis, the two processes are distinct. Photosynthesis is a metabolic pathway, whereas the loss of water vapour is a physical process of diffusion."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_377.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "17 the pathway taken by water through a plant is shown.\nroot hair cells \u2014 root cortex cells + z \u2014 mesophyll cells\nwhich part of the pathway is z?\na palisade cells\nb- phloem\nc_ stomata\nd~ xylem", "Chapter": 8, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. xylem**\n\nThe pathway of water through a plant begins with absorption from the soil by root hair cells.

To perform this function effectively, they have specific structural adaptations. Arteries possess a thick wall composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibres. This robust wall allows the artery to withstand the high pressure of blood being ejected from the ventricles and to stretch and recoil with each heartbeat, which helps to maintain blood flow and pressure. In relation to their thick walls, arteries have a relatively narrow central cavity, or lumen. This narrow lumen helps to maintain the high blood pressure necessary to propel blood throughout the body's systemic or pulmonary circuits.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nWhile arteries do have a narrow lumen to maintain high blood pressure, their walls are not made of a single layer of cells. This feature\u2014a wall that is one cell thick\u2014is characteristic of capillaries.

A wide lumen is a characteristic feature of veins. Veins transport blood back to the heart under low pressure. The wide lumen minimises resistance to blood flow, which is important as the pressure driving the blood forward is much lower than in the arteries. Arteries have a narrow lumen, which is essential for maintaining the high blood pressure generated by the heart.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nNeither of these statements accurately describes the features of an artery.

These organisms invade a host, multiply, and disrupt normal bodily functions, leading to the signs and symptoms of an illness.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. antibodies**\nAntibodies are not disease-causing organisms; they are a key part of the body's immune defense *against* disease. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. They recognize and bind to specific molecules (antigens) on the surface of pathogens, neutralizing them or marking them for destruction by other immune cells.\n\n**C. phagocytes**\nPhagocytes are a type of white blood cell that protects the body by ingesting (engulfing) harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells. This process is called phagocytosis. Phagocytes are a crucial component of the innate immune system, acting as a first line of defense against infection, rather than being a cause of it.\n\n**D. vaccines**\nVaccines are biological preparations designed to *prevent* disease, not cause it. A vaccine typically contains a harmless form of a pathogen (such as a weakened or killed version) or a part of it (like a surface protein).

It is this blastocyst, a stage of embryonic development, that travels from the oviduct to the uterus and embeds itself into the uterine lining (endometrium) in a process called implantation.

Adrenaline is a hormone released in 'fight or flight' situations. This response prepares the body for intense physical activity by optimising physiological functions, including vision. To spot potential dangers, it is advantageous to focus on distant objects. This is achieved by the relaxation of the ciliary muscles. When these muscles relax, their shape changes, which increases the tension in the suspensory ligaments. This tension pulls on the lens, causing it to become thinner and less convex, thereby adjusting the eye's focus for distant vision. Therefore, the ciliary body changes shape in response to adrenaline to alter the eye's focal power.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Structure A is the retina. This is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones). Its function is to convert light energy into neural signals. The retina is a layer of nervous tissue and does not change shape.\n\n**B:** Structure B is the optic nerve.

The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye by changing the size of the pupil. In response to adrenaline, the radial muscles within the iris contract, causing the pupil to dilate (widen). While the iris does change shape, the change in the ciliary muscle (C) is what alters the focal length of the eye by changing the shape of the lens. Adjusting focus for distant vision is a key adaptation in the 'fight or flight' response, and this is directly controlled by the ciliary muscles."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_388.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 what is an example of a population?\na all the animals and plants living in a lake\nb all the different herbivores in a forest\ncall the mahogany trees growing in a forest\nd all the species of animals in africa", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nIn ecology, a **population** is defined as a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same geographical area at the same time and are capable of interbreeding.

Antibiotics are produced by white blood cells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibiotics are chemical substances, most of which are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi (e.g., *Penicillium* fungus produces penicillin) and bacteria (e.g., *Streptomyces* bacteria produce streptomycin). White blood cells are components of the immune system that produce antibodies, which are proteins that target specific pathogens for destruction, but they do not produce antibiotics.\n\n**C. Antibiotics can become resistant to bacteria.**\nThis statement misrepresents the concept of antibiotic resistance. It is the bacteria that become resistant to the effects of an antibiotic, not the other way around.

These resistant bacteria then reproduce, leading to a population that is no longer affected by that specific drug. The antibiotic itself does not change.\n\n**D. Antibiotics kill viruses.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibiotics are effective only against bacteria because they target specific structures or metabolic pathways unique to bacterial cells, such as the cell wall or protein synthesis machinery.

The rate of these reactions is highly sensitive to temperature changes.\n\n1.  **Initial Temperature Rise:** At low temperatures, both enzyme and substrate molecules have low kinetic energy. This results in infrequent collisions, and therefore, a slow rate of respiration. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between enzymes and their substrates. This increases the rate of reaction.\n2.  **Optimum Temperature:** The rate continues to increase until it reaches an optimal temperature. At this point, the enzyme is working at its maximum efficiency, and the rate of respiration is at its peak.\n3.  **High Temperatures:** Beyond the optimum temperature, the high thermal energy begins to break the weak bonds that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure. This change in shape, particularly of the active site, is called denaturation. The substrate can no longer fit properly into the denatured active site, causing a rapid decrease in the rate of respiration.\n\nThis relationship, where the rate increases to an optimum and then rapidly decreases, is correctly represented by the bell-shaped curve in graph A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** This graph incorrectly suggests a linear, directly proportional relationship where the rate of respiration increases indefinitely as temperature increases. While the rate does increase with temperature initially, it does not continue to do so without limit. This graph fails to account for the denaturation of enzymes at high temperatures, which causes the rate to decrease rapidly after reaching an optimum.\n\n**C:** This graph shows the rate of respiration being highest at very low temperatures and continuously decreasing as the temperature rises. This is biologically incorrect. At low temperatures, enzymes have very low kinetic energy, leading to a very slow rate of reaction, not the maximum rate.\n\n**D:** This graph shows a U-shaped curve, suggesting that the rate of respiration is high at both very low and very high temperatures, with a minimum rate at an intermediate temperature.

The vagina is a muscular tube that connects the cervix (the lower part of the uterus) to the outside of the body. Its function is to receive sperm during sexual intercourse. While sperm are deposited here, they must travel through the uterus and into the fallopian tubes to meet the egg. Therefore, fertilisation does not take place in the vagina.\n\n**D:** The structure labelled D is the uterus, or womb. The primary function of the uterus is to house and nourish a developing fetus after a fertilised egg has implanted into its wall (the endometrium). Implantation occurs in the uterus, but this happens after fertilisation has already occurred in the fallopian tube. Therefore, the uterus is the site of fetal development, not fertilisation."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_394.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "34 the diagram shows part of a genetic diagram for the inheritance of sex in humans. the sex\nchromosomes in two gametes are shown.\nparents father mother\n~~ \u00a9o o@\nwhat are the sex chromosomes in gametes 1 and 2?\ngamete gamete\n1 2\na x y\nb x x\ncc \u00a5 y\nd \u00a5 x", "Chapter": 17, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn humans, the sex of an individual is determined by the sex chromosomes. A biological female has two X chromosomes (XX), while a biological male has one X and one Y chromosome (XY).\n\nDuring meiosis, the process of forming gametes (sperm and eggs), the chromosome number is halved.\n*   The father (XY) produces two types of sperm. Half of his sperm will carry an X chromosome, and the other half will carry a Y chromosome. The diagram shows one of the father's gametes is X, so the other type, gamete 1, must be Y.\n*   The mother (XX) produces only one type of egg. All her eggs will carry a single X chromosome. Therefore, gamete 2 must be an X chromosome.\n\nThus, gamete 1 contains a Y chromosome, and gamete 2 contains an X chromosome.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because a mother has the genotype XX and can only produce gametes containing an X chromosome. She cannot produce a gamete with a Y chromosome. Furthermore, since the father is XY and one of his gametes shown is X, the other must be Y.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect. While the mother's gamete (gamete 2) is correctly identified as X, the father's gamete (gamete 1) is not. A father has XY chromosomes, producing both X and Y sperm. If one gamete is X, the other type must be Y.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect. While the father's gamete (gamete 1) is correctly identified as Y, the mother's gamete (gamete 2) is not.

In this example, elephants either have tusks or they do not. There is no continuous range of tusk presence. This \"either/or\" nature is the hallmark of discontinuous variation.\n*   **Genetic Variation:** This variation is caused by differences in the genes (alleles) an individual inherits. The passage states that tuskless elephants give birth to offspring that are also tuskless. This demonstrates that the trait is heritable, meaning it is passed down from one generation to the next through genes. Therefore, the variation is genetic in origin.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the variation as continuous and not genetic.\n\n*   **Continuous Variation:** This is incorrect because continuous variation shows a complete range of measurements from one extreme to another (e.g., height or weight). The presence or absence of tusks is a distinct characteristic, not one that exists on a continuous spectrum.\n*   **Genetic Variation:** This is also incorrect. The fact that the tuskless trait is passed from parent to offspring is clear evidence of a genetic basis for the variation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the variation as continuous.\n\n*   **Continuous Variation:** This is incorrect. As explained above, the variation is discontinuous because the elephants fall into two clear-cut groups: those with tusks and those without. There are no intermediate phenotypes described, which would be expected in continuous variation. Although this option correctly identifies the variation as genetic, its classification of the variation type is wrong.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the variation as not being genetic.\n\n*   **Genetic Variation:** This is incorrect because the passage explicitly describes the inheritance of the tuskless trait. When a characteristic is passed from parents to their offspring, it is by definition a heritable, genetic trait. Environmental variation, in contrast, is acquired during an organism's lifetime and is not passed on to the next generation.

Due to the significant loss of energy at each successive trophic level (typically around 90%), the total biomass also decreases progressively up the food chain. This means that the total mass of producers is almost always greater than the total mass of primary consumers, which in turn is greater than the total mass of secondary consumers, and so on.\n\nConsequently, pyramids of biomass are characteristically upright, with the largest block representing the producers at the base and progressively smaller blocks for each subsequent trophic level. Both diagram 2 and diagram 3 depict this standard upright pyramid shape, making them valid representations of a pyramid of biomass.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: 1 and 2\n\nThis option is incorrect because diagram 1 represents an inverted pyramid. An inverted pyramid is not a typical shape for a pyramid of biomass. While a rare exception exists in some aquatic ecosystems where producers (phytoplankton) have very short lifespans and are consumed rapidly by primary consumers (zooplankton), the biomass of the tree in a terrestrial ecosystem, for example, would be far greater than the biomass of the insects feeding on it. In contrast, an inverted pyramid is a common shape for a pyramid of numbers, such as when many insects feed on a single large tree.\n\n#### B: 1 and 4\n\nThis option is incorrect because neither diagram 1 nor diagram 4 typically represents a pyramid of biomass. Diagram 1 is an inverted pyramid, which is not characteristic of biomass for reasons explained above. Diagram 4 shows a spindle-shaped pyramid, where the biomass of a middle trophic level is greater than the levels below and above it. This is impossible for a pyramid of biomass, as it would violate the laws of thermodynamics; organisms cannot create more mass than they consume from the trophic level beneath them. A spindle shape is, however, possible for a pyramid of numbers (e.g., one tree supports many birds, which in turn host a very large number of parasites).\n\n#### D: 3 and 4\n\nThis option is incorrect because diagram 4 cannot represent a pyramid of biomass. A spindle-shaped pyramid implies that the biomass of primary or secondary consumers is greater than the biomass of the producers. This is not ecologically possible, as the energy and matter required to build the biomass of consumers must come from the trophic level below, and significant energy is lost at each transfer. Therefore, the biomass must decrease at each successive trophic level, making a spindle shape invalid for pyramids of biomass."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_397.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 which process transfers energy between the first and second trophic levels of a food chain?\na egestion\nb _ ingestion\nc photosynthesis\nd respiration", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nIngestion is the process of taking food into the body by swallowing or absorbing it. In a food chain, energy flows from one trophic level to the next when an organism is consumed. The first trophic level consists of producers (e.g., plants), which store chemical energy in their tissues. The second trophic level consists of primary consumers (herbivores). For energy to be transferred from the first to the second trophic level, the primary consumer must eat, or ingest, the producer. This act of ingestion transfers the energy-rich organic molecules from the producer to the consumer.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: egestion**\nEgestion is the process of discharging undigested or waste material (faeces) from the body. This process represents energy that was ingested but could not be digested and absorbed by the organism. Therefore, egestion is a pathway for energy *loss* from a trophic level, not a method of energy transfer *between* trophic levels. The energy in egested material is available to decomposers, but it has not been assimilated by the consumer at that trophic level.\n\n**C: photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which producers (the first trophic level) convert light energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of glucose. This is how energy initially *enters* the food chain. It is not a process that transfers energy *between* the first and second trophic levels. Organisms in the second trophic level (primary consumers) are typically animals and do not perform photosynthesis.\n\n**D: respiration**\nCellular respiration is the process that occurs within the cells of organisms at *all* trophic levels to release the chemical energy stored in organic molecules (like glucose) for metabolic activities. A significant amount of this energy is lost as heat to the environment. Respiration is therefore a process of energy transformation and loss *within* an organism or trophic level, not a mechanism for transferring energy *to the next* trophic level."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_398.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 the diagram shows part of the carbon cycle.\nwhich arrow represents respiration?\na\ncarbon + ll\nthe atmosphere plants\nd", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nArrow B represents the process of respiration in green plants.

In genetic engineering, a specific gene from another organism, such as the human gene for insulin, is inserted into a small, circular piece of bacterial DNA called a plasmid. This modified plasmid is then introduced into a host bacterium. The bacterium's cellular machinery reads the inserted gene and synthesizes the corresponding complex protein. Because bacteria reproduce very quickly, they can be grown in large numbers in industrial fermenters, leading to the mass production of valuable and complex molecules like medicines and enzymes.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. They reproduce slowly.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. A key advantage of using bacteria in biotechnology is their extremely rapid rate of reproduction. Through a process called binary fission, many bacterial species can double their population in as little as 20 minutes under optimal conditions. This rapid proliferation allows for the quick cultivation of a large population of genetically modified bacteria, which in turn enables the fast and efficient production of the desired product in large quantities.\n\n**C. They have a nucleus.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms, which are defined by the absence of a membrane-bound nucleus. Their genetic material consists of a single, large circular chromosome located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. Additionally, they often contain one or more small, circular DNA molecules called plasmids. The absence of a nucleus and the presence of these easily accessible plasmids are features that make bacteria relatively simple to genetically modify, making them ideal candidates for use in biotechnology.\n\n**D. They are the same as plant cells.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Bacterial cells and plant cells have fundamental structural and organisational differences. Bacteria are prokaryotes, lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. Their cell walls are made of peptidoglycan. In contrast, plant cells are eukaryotes, containing a true nucleus and numerous membrane-bound organelles. Their cell walls are composed of cellulose.

In this process, the human gene that codes for a desired protein, such as insulin or human growth hormone, is isolated. This gene is then inserted into a bacterial plasmid (a small, circular piece of DNA). The recombinant plasmid is subsequently introduced into a bacterial cell, typically *Escherichia coli*. As the bacteria multiply rapidly in large-scale fermenters, they express the inserted human gene, producing large quantities of the human protein. This protein can then be harvested, purified, and used for therapeutic purposes, such as treating diabetes with human insulin.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) to confer resistance to herbicides:**\nThis is a common goal of genetic engineering, but it is applied to crop plants, not bacteria. Genes that confer resistance to specific herbicides are inserted into the plant's genome. This allows farmers to spray their fields with herbicides to eliminate weeds without damaging the genetically modified crop.\n\n**B) to confer resistance to insect pests:**\nThis modification is also performed on crop plants. A well-known example is the insertion of the gene for the Bt toxin, derived from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis*, into crops like corn and cotton. The plant then produces this toxin, which is harmful to specific insect pests, thereby protecting the crop from damage.\n\n**C) to improve their nutritional qualities:**\nImproving nutritional quality is a goal of genetically modifying crop plants to benefit human health.

These specialized cells possess tiny, hair-like projections called cilia on their surface. The cilia beat in a coordinated, wave-like manner, creating a current that propels the layer of mucus covering them. This mucus, produced by nearby goblet cells, traps inhaled dust, pollen, and pathogens. The continuous upward movement of this mucus, known as the mucociliary escalator, transports these trapped particles out of the lungs and towards the pharynx, where the mucus can be either swallowed or coughed out. This is a critical defence mechanism of the respiratory system, preventing foreign particles and microorganisms from reaching the delicate alveoli.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. to absorb oxygen**\nThis statement is incorrect. The absorption of oxygen, or gas exchange, is the main function of the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchioles. The alveoli are specifically adapted for this role with features such as extremely thin walls (one-cell thick), a large total surface area, and a rich supply of capillaries. The walls of the bronchi are too thick for efficient gas diffusion to occur. The bronchi serve as passageways to conduct air to and from the lungs, not as sites for gas exchange.\n\n**B. to digest pathogens**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the respiratory system does have mechanisms to deal with pathogens, the digestion (or destruction) of them is primarily carried out by phagocytic immune cells, such as macrophages. These cells engulf pathogens and break them down using enzymes. Ciliated cells play a role in defence by physically removing pathogens that are trapped in mucus, but they do not have the cellular machinery to digest them.\n\n**D. to produce antibodies**\nThis statement is incorrect. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell (which develops from a B-lymphocyte).

A partially permeable membrane is essential for this process as it allows small molecules like water to pass through but prevents the passage of larger solute molecules. Therefore, the molecule that moves during osmosis is water, and it occurs across a partially permeable membrane.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) oxygen, partially permeable**\nThis is incorrect because osmosis specifically describes the movement of water molecules. The movement of oxygen molecules across a membrane is an example of diffusion, not osmosis. Although it occurs across a partially permeable membrane (like the cell membrane), the moving molecule is incorrect.\n\n**B) oxygen, permeable**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, osmosis involves the movement of water, not oxygen. Secondly, osmosis requires a partially permeable membrane to establish a water potential gradient.

They are a type of globular protein. Proteins are polymers made from chains of amino acid monomers. The specific sequence of these amino acids causes the polypeptide chain to fold into a unique and complex three-dimensional shape. This specific 3D structure is crucial for the enzyme's function as it creates a region called the active site. The active site has a shape that is precisely complementary to its specific substrate, allowing the enzyme to bind to the substrate and catalyse a reaction. This \"lock-and-key\" or \"induced-fit\" mechanism is fundamental to an enzyme's specificity and catalytic power, which is entirely dependent on its protein structure.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\nCarbohydrates are a class of biological molecules whose primary roles are energy provision and structural support. For example, glucose is a simple sugar used for immediate energy in cellular respiration, while starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) are complex carbohydrates used for energy storage. Cellulose is a structural carbohydrate found in plant cell walls.

This change destroys the active site, causing the enzyme to lose its function. On the graph, this is shown by the rapid decrease in enzyme activity after the optimum temperature. The temperature at which the enzyme is **completely denatured** is the point where its activity drops to zero. According to the graph, the curve returns to the x-axis (zero activity) at 60\u00b0C. Therefore, the optimum temperature is 50\u00b0C and the temperature of complete denaturation is 60\u00b0C.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: optimum = 30\u00b0C, completely denatured = 0\u00b0C**\nThis option is incorrect. The graph shows that at 30\u00b0C, the enzyme's activity is still increasing and has not yet reached its maximum. At 0\u00b0C, the enzyme is not denatured but is inactive due to low kinetic energy; the enzyme and substrate molecules move too slowly for frequent collisions. If the temperature were raised, the enzyme would regain its activity.\n\n**B: optimum = 30\u00b0C, completely denatured = 60\u00b0C**\nThis option is incorrect because the optimum temperature is not 30\u00b0C. While the temperature for complete denaturation is correctly identified as 60\u00b0C, the peak activity, and thus the optimum temperature, is clearly at 50\u00b0C.\n\n**C: optimum = 50\u00b0C, completely denatured = 0\u00b0C**\nThis option is incorrect. Although the optimum temperature is correctly identified as 50\u00b0C, the enzyme is not denatured at 0\u00b0C. At low temperatures, enzymes are temporarily inactivated, not permanently denatured.

The chemical equation is: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + Light Energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082. In the sealed environment of test-tube X, the plant absorbs carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis. The indicator turns blue when the carbon dioxide concentration decreases. This matches the experimental observation, indicating that the net process occurring was the consumption of carbon dioxide by the plant. Although plants also respire, in the presence of light, the rate of photosynthesis is typically greater than the rate of respiration, resulting in a net decrease in carbon dioxide levels.\n\n**A. germination (Incorrect)**\n\nGermination is the process where a seed develops into a young plant. The experiment uses a small plant that has already germinated. Furthermore, germination involves a high rate of cellular respiration to provide the energy needed for growth. Respiration releases carbon dioxide, which would have increased its concentration in the test tube and caused the indicator to turn yellow, not blue.\n\n**C. respiration (Incorrect)**\n\nCellular respiration is a process that occurs continuously in living plant cells to release energy for metabolic activities. This process breaks down glucose and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration would cause the indicator to turn yellow. The observed result was the indicator turning blue, which signifies a decrease in carbon dioxide. Therefore, while the plant was respiring, this was not the process responsible for the observed colour change. The net effect was a reduction in carbon dioxide, meaning its consumption by photosynthesis was occurring at a faster rate than its production by respiration.\n\n**D. transpiration (Incorrect)**\n\nTranspiration is the process of water evaporating from the surfaces of a plant, primarily the leaves. This process involves the loss of water vapour and does not directly involve the uptake or release of carbon dioxide.

Water is absorbed from the soil by the roots and transported upwards through the xylem vessels to the leaves. In the leaf, this water evaporates from the surface of the mesophyll cells into the air spaces within the leaf. When the stomata are open, this water vapour diffuses out of the leaf and into the surrounding atmosphere, following a water potential gradient. This process creates a tension or pull, known as the transpiration stream, which is the main driving force for drawing water up from the roots to the rest of the plant.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. the breakdown of nutrient molecules to release energy**\n\nThis statement describes the process of cellular respiration, not transpiration. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients (like glucose) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. It is the fundamental process by which living cells generate usable energy to power cellular activities.\n\n**B. the flow of energy through living organisms**\n\nThis describes the concept of energy flow within an ecosystem. It refers to the transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next, starting with solar energy captured by producers (e.g., plants through photosynthesis) and moving through various levels of consumers. This is a broad ecological principle concerning food chains and food webs, not a specific physiological process within a single plant.\n\n**D. the pressure of water inside cells pressing outwards on the cell wall**\n\nThis statement defines turgor pressure (or hydrostatic pressure). When a plant cell takes in water by osmosis, its central vacuole swells and pushes the cytoplasm against the inelastic cell wall. This outward pressure makes the cell firm, or turgid. Turgor pressure is crucial for providing structural support to non-woody plants and for processes like the opening and closing of stomata, but it is not the definition of transpiration itself."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_416.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "16 the photomicrograph shows a cross-section through a leaf.\nwhich structure is the cuticle?\na\n39 922\nrep a at a\nd\u2014_ [a rr reer ata ta a\na fotki fui! le rit sess od zee nt ih ca tiled b\nob fa aaa ta abel) thle! gap roo oe le\nmey anki i hm: son, ie ieee\ncr 5s re ae ee oo s,.*\npach. ol \u00a7 oo eo & bo. oaors\ngoers cpe? oa pn rie og ow ke ee\na eee ies p> eh 4 so es, a, wand gs xe oe\n\u201cth 2. bo eye", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nThe structure labelled A is the cuticle.

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that the human body cannot synthesise and must obtain from the diet. Its primary role includes the synthesis of collagen, a vital structural protein found in connective tissues such as skin, blood vessels, bones, and cartilage. Without adequate vitamin C, collagen production is impaired, leading to weakened tissues. This results in the characteristic symptoms of scurvy, which include bleeding gums, poor wound healing, bruising, and weakness.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) calcium:** A deficiency in calcium does not cause scurvy.

This process occurs at two main locations in the digestive system.\n1.  **Mouth (P):** The salivary glands in the mouth produce salivary amylase, which mixes with food during chewing. This begins the breakdown of starch in the neutral pH environment of the mouth.\n2.  **Small Intestine (indicated by S/T):** The pancreas (S) produces pancreatic amylase. This enzyme is secreted into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine, where the arrow for S is pointing. Here, in the alkaline conditions created by pancreatic juice, pancreatic amylase continues the digestion of starch that was not broken down in the mouth. Therefore, amylase acts in the mouth (P) and in the initial part of the small intestine, where enzymes from the pancreas (S) are released.\n\n**Explanations for the incorrect answers:**\n\n*   **A (P and R):** Amylase acts in the mouth (P), but it does not act in the stomach (R). The stomach contains hydrochloric acid, creating a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5).

They have walls that are only one cell thick, which creates a very short diffusion distance. Oxygen and nutrients, such as glucose, diffuse from the blood inside the capillaries, where their concentration is high, into the surrounding tissue fluid and then into the body cells, where their concentration is lower. Simultaneously, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the cells into the blood to be transported away. Capillaries form extensive networks, known as capillary beds, throughout all tissues to ensure every cell is close enough for this vital exchange to happen efficiently.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Arteries**\nArteries are blood vessels responsible for transporting oxygenated blood under high pressure away from the heart to the various parts of the body. Their walls are thick, muscular, and elastic to withstand this pressure. This thick structure makes them unsuitable for the exchange of substances. While they carry the oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood towards the cells, the actual delivery to the cells does not happen across the arterial walls.\n\n**C: Lungs**\nThe lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system, responsible for gas exchange between the air we breathe and the blood. Oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide leaves the blood within the alveoli of the lungs. However, the lungs only provide oxygen *to the blood*.

Urea is the main nitrogenous waste product in mammals, formed in the liver from the breakdown of excess amino acids. The blood transports this urea to the kidneys. Within the kidneys, millions of functional units called nephrons filter the blood. Urea, along with excess water and salts, is removed from the blood to form urine. This urine is then transported to the bladder for temporary storage before being expelled from the body. Therefore, the kidneys are the organs that excrete urea from the bloodstream.\n\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A. bladder:** The bladder is an organ that stores urine produced by the kidneys.

The term is derived from the Greek words 'photo' (light) and 'tropos' (turning). Plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, meaning they grow towards a light source. This response is mediated by the plant hormone auxin. When light shines on a shoot from one side, auxin accumulates on the shaded side. This higher concentration of auxin causes the cells on the shaded side to elongate more rapidly than the cells on the illuminated side, resulting in the shoot bending towards the light. This is an adaptive advantage as it maximizes the leaves' exposure to light for photosynthesis.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. gravitropism**\nGravitropism (also known as geotropism) is a plant's directional growth in response to gravity. Plant roots typically show positive gravitropism, growing downwards in the direction of gravitational pull, while shoots show negative gravitropism, growing upwards against it. The stimulus in this case is gravity, not light. Therefore, gravitropism does not describe the plant's response to light.\n\n**B. photosynthesis**\nPhotosynthesis is a metabolic process, not a growth movement. It is the chemical reaction in which plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (for energy) and oxygen. While the response of phototropism helps to position the plant optimally for photosynthesis, photosynthesis itself is the process of energy conversion, not the physical bending of the shoot.\n\n**D. reflex**\nA reflex is a rapid, involuntary response to a stimulus that is characteristic of animals with a nervous system. Reflex actions involve a neural pathway called a reflex arc and are extremely fast. Plants lack a nervous system and muscles, so they cannot perform reflexes.

They work by targeting and disrupting essential processes in bacterial cells that are not present in human (eukaryotic) cells. For example, some antibiotics, like penicillin, interfere with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, causing the bacteria to lyse (burst) and die. Others may inhibit bacterial protein synthesis or DNA replication. This specificity allows antibiotics to eliminate bacterial pathogens while causing minimal harm to the host's cells.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. rickets:**\nRickets is a skeletal disorder, not an infection. It is caused by a nutritional deficiency, specifically a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. These nutrients are essential for the proper mineralization and hardening of bones. Without them, bones become soft and weak, leading to skeletal deformities. The treatment for rickets involves correcting the nutritional deficiency through diet and supplements, not antibiotics, as there is no bacterial pathogen involved.\n\n**C. scurvy:**\nScurvy is a disease resulting from a severe deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is vital for the synthesis of collagen, a protein essential for the health of connective tissues, blood vessels, and skin. Scurvy is therefore a nutritional deficiency disease, not an infection caused by a pathogen. Treatment involves increasing vitamin C intake. Antibiotics would have no effect on this condition.\n\n**D. a viral infection:**\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Viruses are fundamentally different from bacteria; they are not living cells and lack the cellular structures and metabolic pathways that antibiotics target. For instance, viruses do not have cell walls or their own ribosomes for protein synthesis. Instead, they invade host cells and use the host's cellular machinery to replicate. Treating a viral infection requires antiviral drugs, which are specifically designed to inhibit the viral life cycle.

The offspring inherits the genes of that one parent only. There is no fusion of gametes (sex cells) involved. The primary cell division process is mitosis, which creates genetically identical daughter cells. Consequently, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent and to each other; they are often referred to as clones.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) the production of genetically different offspring from one parent**\nThis statement is incorrect. While it correctly identifies that asexual reproduction involves only one parent, it incorrectly claims the offspring are genetically different. The defining characteristic of asexual reproduction is the production of genetically identical offspring, or clones. Genetic variation in asexually reproducing populations arises primarily from rare, random mutations, not as a direct and intended result of the reproductive process itself.\n\n**B) the production of genetically different offspring from two parents**\nThis statement describes sexual reproduction, not asexual reproduction.

This genetic variation is a key feature and advantage of sexual reproduction.\n\n**D) the production of genetically identical offspring from two parents**\nThis statement is biologically inconsistent.

The journey for sperm from the point of ejaculation in the vagina to the egg in the fallopian tube (oviduct) is long and fraught with challenges. A very high percentage of sperm do not survive this journey due to factors such as the acidic environment of the vagina, the challenge of navigating through the cervix and uterus, attacks from the female's immune system, and simply exhausting their energy reserves. By producing hundreds of millions of sperm, the probability that at least one will successfully reach and fertilise the single egg is significantly increased.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Many sperm cells are needed to fertilise an egg cell.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Fertilisation is the fusion of the nucleus of a single sperm cell with the nucleus of a single egg cell. While many sperm may reach the egg and release enzymes from their acrosomes to help break down the egg's protective outer layers, only one sperm is permitted to penetrate and fuse with the egg's cell membrane. Mechanisms are in place (such as the cortical reaction) to prevent polyspermy, which is the fertilisation of an egg by more than one sperm, as this would result in a non-viable zygote.\n\n**B. Sperm cells are small in size.**\nWhile it is true that sperm cells are much smaller than egg cells, this is a characteristic, not the reason for their high numbers. The small size of sperm is an adaptation for motility and reduces the energy cost of producing each individual cell, which in turn makes mass production feasible. However, the fundamental reason *why* so many are needed is the low probability of any single sperm surviving its journey, not its size.\n\n**C. Sperm cells are non-motile.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Sperm cells are highly motile (capable of movement). They possess a long tail, or flagellum, which propels them through the female reproductive tract. This motility is essential for the sperm to travel from the vagina, through the uterus, and into the fallopian tubes to reach the egg.

A female has two X chromosomes (XX), while a male has one X and one Y chromosome (XY).\n\nGametes (sperm and egg cells) are haploid, meaning they contain half the number of chromosomes as a somatic (body) cell. During meiosis in a female (XX), all egg cells produced will contain a single X chromosome. In a male (XY), meiosis results in the production of two types of sperm cells in roughly equal numbers: half will contain an X chromosome, and the other half will contain a Y chromosome.\n\nFor an offspring to be male (XY), it must inherit one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Since the egg cell from the mother can only contribute an X chromosome, the sperm cell from the father must contribute a Y chromosome. Therefore, the fertilization of an X-containing egg by a Y-containing sperm results in a zygote with the genotype XY, which develops into a male offspring.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: X only\n\nIf a sperm cell containing an X chromosome fertilizes an egg cell (which always contains an X chromosome), the resulting zygote will have the genotype XX. This combination of sex chromosomes leads to the development of a female offspring, not a male.\n\n#### C: XX\n\nSperm cells are gametes, which are haploid cells produced through meiosis. This process ensures that gametes contain only half the genetic material of the parent cell, meaning they have only one of each chromosome, including a single sex chromosome. A sperm cell cannot normally contain two X chromosomes (XX), as this represents the diploid chromosome combination for a female somatic cell, not a haploid gamete.\n\n#### D: XY\n\nA sperm cell is a haploid gamete.

This trait is controlled by a single gene, often denoted as the ABO gene, which has three different versions, or alleles: I^A, I^B, and i. An individual inherits one allele from each parent. The specific combination of these two alleles determines the person's blood type.\n\n*   **Allele I^A** codes for antigen A.\n*   **Allele I^B** codes for antigen B.\n*   **Allele i** is recessive and does not code for any antigen.\n\nThe relationship between these alleles (dominance and codominance) dictates the final phenotype (the observable blood group). Since an individual's blood type is fixed at the moment of fertilisation based on the alleles they inherit and is not influenced by external factors like diet or climate, this variation is caused by genes only.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. environment only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because an individual's ABO blood type is an inherited characteristic. It is determined by the genes passed down from their parents, not by any environmental factors. Factors such as diet, lifestyle, geographical location, or exposure to disease do not alter a person's blood group. For example, a person with blood type A will remain blood type A throughout their life, regardless of changes in their environment.\n\n**C. genes and environment**\n\nThis option is incorrect because, while many traits are influenced by both genetics and the environment (a type of variation known as continuous variation, e.g., height or weight), the ABO blood group is not one of them. The determination of blood type A, B, AB, or O is strictly genetic. There is no known environmental factor that can change the antigens present on a person's red blood cells, which are dictated by the ABO gene. Therefore, the environment does not contribute to this specific type of variation.\n\n**D. mutation and environment**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as established, the environment does not play a role in determining ABO blood type. Secondly, while mutation is the ultimate source of new alleles (the I^A and I^B alleles originally arose from mutations of a pre-existing gene), it is not the direct cause of the variation seen among individuals in a population. The variation in blood groups is caused by the inheritance of different combinations of these already existing alleles (genes). Therefore, \"genes only\" is the most accurate and direct explanation for the cause of this variation."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_437.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "37 which statement is an example of natural selection?\na_ choosing donkeys with desirable characteristics to breed\nb_ choosing to cross-pollinate wheat plants with the highest yields\nc inserting genes into a crop plant to improve its nutritional qualities\nd _inwild flowers, the development of petals that look like insects to attract pollinators", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nNatural selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. In the case of wild flowers, there is variation in petal shape within the population. Flowers with petals that, by chance, more closely resemble insects are more likely to attract specific pollinators. This increases their chances of successful reproduction compared to flowers with less convincing petal shapes. Over many generations, this environmental pressure \"selects\" for the genes responsible for insect-like petals, leading to the evolution of this specific adaptation. The process is driven by natural environmental factors (the need for pollination) without any human intervention.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A & B: Explanations**\nThese are examples of **artificial selection**, also known as selective breeding. In this process, humans, not the natural environment, act as the selective agent. Humans intentionally choose organisms with specific desirable traits and breed them together. For example, choosing donkeys with desirable characteristics or wheat plants with the highest yields are deliberate actions taken by humans to enhance traits that are beneficial to them. This is fundamentally different from natural selection, where survival and reproductive success in a natural environment determine which traits are passed on.\n\n**C: Explanation**\nThis statement describes **genetic engineering**, a modern biotechnology technique. Genetic engineering involves the direct manipulation of an organism's genetic material (DNA) by inserting, deleting, or modifying specific genes. This process introduces new traits into an organism directly, bypassing the mechanisms of both natural and artificial selection, which rely on selecting from existing genetic variation within a population over generations."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_438.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "38 the graph shows the increase in the human population of the world since 1630.\nvo 1 ti\n\u2018ooo! | | 1 ty\n4000\npopuiaton on) | |\nrere mt tt tt ve\n\u2018om | ll et i\n1000 = |\nort | tl |\n1630 1730 1830 1930 2030\nyear\nwhat was the longest time taken for the population to double?\na 100 years b 200 years c 300 years d 400 years", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Rationale for the correct answer\n\nThe graph illustrates exponential growth in the human population, where the rate of increase becomes progressively faster over time. This means that the time it takes for the population to double (the doubling time) decreases over the centuries. To find the longest doubling time, one must examine the earliest period shown on the graph.\n\n1.  **Initial Period:** In the year 1630, the world population was approximately 500 million. For the population to double, it would need to reach 1000 million (1 billion). According to the graph, the population reached 1000 million in the year 1830. The time taken for this doubling is calculated as 1830 - 1630 = 200 years.\n2.  **Subsequent Period:** The next doubling occurred from 1000 million (in 1830) to 2000 million. The graph shows the population reached 2000 million in 1930. This doubling took 1930 - 1830 = 100 years.\n3.  **Later Period:** A further doubling from 2000 million (in 1930) to 4000 million occurred in an even shorter time (approximately 45 years, reaching 4 billion around 1975).\n\nComparing these periods, the longest time taken for the population to double was 200 years.\n\n### Rationale for the incorrect answers\n\n*   **A. 100 years:** A doubling time of 100 years is shown on the graph, specifically for the population increase from 1000 million (1 billion) in 1830 to 2000 million (2 billion) in 1930. However, this is not the *longest* time taken for the population to double. The earlier doubling, from 500 million to 1000 million, took 200 years.\n\n*   **C. 300 years:** There is no interval on the graph where the population took 300 years to double. For instance, in the 300-year period from 1630 to 1930, the population increased from 500 million to 2000 million. This represents a quadrupling of the population (it doubled twice), not a single doubling event.\n\n*   **D. 400 years:** A doubling time of 400 years is not supported by the data. The entire period shown on the graph demonstrates an accelerating growth rate, meaning the doubling time has consistently decreased.

Air pollution, particularly from sulfur dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, is typically highest in a city centre and decreases with increasing distance. Lichens are highly sensitive to air pollution and are used as bioindicators. Consequently, in the highly polluted city centre (distance = 0 km), very few, if any, lichen species can survive, so their number is at its lowest. As one moves away from the city centre towards the unpolluted countryside (distance = 15 km), the air quality improves, allowing a greater number and variety of lichen species to thrive. The graph shows a continuous increase in the number of lichen species as the distance from the city centre increases, which accurately reflects this ecological principle.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This graph shows the highest number of lichen species at the city centre, with the number decreasing as the distance from the centre increases. This would suggest that lichens thrive in polluted air and are intolerant of clean air, which is the opposite of the known biological facts about lichens. Lichens are sensitive to pollutants and are less abundant in polluted areas.\n\n**B:** This graph suggests that the number of lichen species is high at the city centre and in the distant countryside, but very low at an intermediate distance. This V-shaped curve would imply that the air is clean in the city centre, most polluted in the suburbs, and clean again in the countryside. This is not a typical pollution gradient for a city, where pollution is generally concentrated at the centre and diffuses outwards.\n\n**D:** This graph shows a peak in the number of lichen species at a moderate distance from the city centre, with low numbers at both the centre and in the far countryside. This pattern would imply that lichens prefer a specific, intermediate level of air quality and that both highly polluted and completely unpolluted air are suboptimal. While some species may have specific tolerances, the general trend for species diversity is to be highest in the least polluted environments.

This creates a concentration gradient for both gases between the frog's body and the surrounding pond water.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Diffusion:** The concentration of dissolved oxygen is higher in the pond water than in the frog's blood and tissues (as it is constantly being used for respiration). Due to this concentration gradient, oxygen will undergo net diffusion from the area of higher concentration (the water) to the area of lower concentration (into the frog) across its permeable skin.\n2.  **Carbon Dioxide Diffusion:** The concentration of carbon dioxide is higher inside the frog's body (as it is a waste product of respiration) than in the surrounding water.

Plant cells absorb water via osmosis, primarily into the large central vacuole. As the vacuole fills with water, it swells and pushes the cell's cytoplasm and cell membrane against the rigid, inelastic cell wall. This outward force exerted by the water and cell contents on the cell wall is called turgor pressure. The cell wall resists this pressure, preventing the cell from bursting. This resistance creates a firm, or turgid, state. The collective turgidity of many individual cells provides the structural support that keeps the plant upright and its leaves spread out.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect because the pressure of water inside the cell acts outwards, not inwards. When water enters a plant cell by osmosis, it increases the volume of the cell's contents, particularly the central vacuole. This increased volume exerts a hydrostatic pressure that pushes the cell membrane and cytoplasm against the cell wall. An inward pressure would imply a force causing the cell to collapse, which is the opposite of the turgid state required for support.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement is incorrect. While water outside the cells does exert a pressure, it is the pressure from *inside* the cells that provides support. For water outside the cells to press inwards significantly, it would typically mean the external solution has a lower water potential than the cell's interior. In this situation, water would move *out* of the cells by osmosis, causing them to lose turgor, become flaccid, and pull away from the cell wall (plasmolysis). This process leads to wilting and a loss of support, not the creation of it.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis statement describes a physically impossible scenario.

Particles move across a cell membrane, using energy released by respiration.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Active transport is the movement of ions or molecules across a cell membrane into a region of higher concentration, assisted by enzymes and requiring energy. This energy is provided in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced during cellular respiration. The process occurs through specific carrier proteins embedded within the cell membrane, which bind to the particles and change shape to move them across the membrane against the concentration gradient.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Particles move into cells, using energy released by photosynthesis.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the direct source of energy for active transport is ATP, which is generated through cellular respiration. While photosynthesis in plant cells produces glucose, which is then used as a substrate for respiration, photosynthesis itself does not directly provide the energy for active transport. All living cells, including plant cells, perform respiration to release energy from glucose to power cellular processes like active transport.\n\n**B. Particles move across a cell wall without using energy.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes movement across the wrong cellular structure and misrepresents the energy requirement. Active transport occurs at the selectively permeable cell **membrane**, not the fully permeable cell **wall**. The cell wall provides structural support but does not regulate the transport of substances in this manner. Furthermore, the defining characteristic of active transport is that it **requires** the expenditure of metabolic energy.\n\n**C. Particles move from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.**\n\nThis statement describes diffusion, which is a form of passive transport. Passive transport does not require metabolic energy because particles move down a concentration gradient. Active transport is the opposite process; it moves particles **against** a concentration gradient, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, which requires an input of energy."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_450.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "10 asample of food was tested with biuret reagent.\nwhich colour would be seen if the food sample contained protein?\na blue-black\nb | brick red\nc yellow-brown\nd_ purple", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. purple\n\nThe biuret test is a chemical assay used to detect the presence of peptide bonds, which are the bonds that link amino acids together to form proteins. The biuret reagent itself is a blue solution containing copper(II) sulfate in an alkaline environment (usually provided by sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide). In the presence of protein, the copper(II) ions in the reagent form a coordination complex with the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the peptide bonds. This complex absorbs light at a different wavelength, resulting in a distinct colour change from blue to purple (or violet/lilac). Therefore, a purple colour is the positive result indicating that the food sample contains protein.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. blue-black**\nA blue-black colour is the characteristic positive result for the test for starch, not protein. This test involves adding iodine solution (which is typically yellow-brown) to a sample. If starch is present, the iodine molecules fit into the helical structure of the starch polymer, forming a starch-iodine complex that appears blue-black. The biuret test for proteins does not produce this colour.\n\n**B. brick red**\nA brick-red colour is the characteristic positive result for the Benedict's test for reducing sugars (such as glucose). This test requires heating a sample with Benedict's solution, which is initially blue. If reducing sugars are present, they reduce the copper(II) ions in the solution to copper(I) oxide, which is an insoluble brick-red precipitate. The biuret test for protein is conducted at room temperature and indicates the presence of peptide bonds, not reducing sugars.\n\n**C. yellow-brown**\nA yellow-brown colour is the typical colour of iodine solution, the reagent used to test for starch.

It is composed of long, unbranched chains of glucose molecules linked together. These chains are arranged in parallel bundles called microfibrils, which possess high tensile strength. This arrangement provides rigidity and structural support to the cell, preventing it from bursting due to osmotic pressure and helping to maintain the plant's overall shape.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\nGlycogen is a polysaccharide that functions as the main form of energy storage in animals and fungi. It is a large, branched polymer of glucose, primarily stored in the liver and muscle cells of vertebrates. Its branched structure allows for the rapid release of glucose molecules when the organism requires energy. Glycogen is not a structural carbohydrate and is not found in plant cell walls.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\nStarch is a polysaccharide that functions as the primary energy storage molecule in plants. It is produced during photosynthesis and stored as small granules within organelles called amyloplasts, typically found in seeds, roots, and tubers. Like glycogen, starch is a polymer of glucose, but its structure is less branched. It is designed for compact, long-term energy storage and does not have the necessary structural properties to form a strong, rigid cell wall.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\nSucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it is a simple carbohydrate made of two smaller sugar units (monosaccharides): one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule. In plants, sucrose is the main form in which carbohydrates are transported from the leaves (where they are produced) to other parts of the plant via the phloem.

The process of digestion breaks these large, complex molecules down into their smaller, absorbable constituents. Protein digestion begins chemically in the stomach. The stomach secretes the enzyme pepsin, which functions in the highly acidic environment to break the peptide bonds within protein molecules. This action breaks large proteins into smaller polypeptide chains. While the complete breakdown into individual amino acids is not finished in the stomach (it is completed in the small intestine by other enzymes like trypsin), amino acids are the ultimate end-product of the entire protein digestion pathway. Within the context of digestive products, amino acids are considered the final, simple molecules derived from proteins.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n*   **Fatty acids & Glycerol:** These molecules are the products of lipid (fat) digestion, not protein digestion. Lipids are broken down by enzymes called lipases. This process occurs primarily in the small intestine, although some limited fat digestion can begin in the stomach via gastric lipase. Fatty acids and glycerol have a different chemical structure and origin than the amino acids that make up proteins.\n\n*   **Proteases:** Proteases are the enzymes that catalyse the digestion of proteins; they are not the products of this process.

The small intestine is the site where the vast majority of water absorption occurs. As digested nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and mineral salts, are actively transported from the lumen of the small intestine into the blood, a water potential gradient is established. This causes a large volume of water to follow these solutes and move into the bloodstream via osmosis. The large intestine, primarily the colon, absorbs most of the remaining water from the undigested material, which is crucial for forming solid faeces and conserving body water. Therefore, both organs play a significant role in water absorption.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. large intestine only:** This statement is incorrect. While a key function of the large intestine is to absorb water, the small intestine absorbs a significantly greater volume of water. To state that absorption occurs *only* in the large intestine ignores the primary site of water reabsorption.\n\n**C. gall bladder and colon:** This option is incorrect because the gall bladder's primary function is to store and concentrate bile produced by the liver.

Additionally, warmer air can hold more moisture, which typically lowers the relative humidity of the air outside the leaf, creating a steeper water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the surrounding atmosphere. This steeper gradient accelerates the diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata, thus increasing the rate of transpiration.\n*   **Wind speed (4):** During transpiration, water vapour diffuses out of the leaf and can accumulate near the leaf surface, creating a layer of humid air known as a boundary layer. This reduces the water potential gradient between the leaf's interior and the outside air, slowing down further transpiration. Increased wind speed blows this humid boundary layer away, maintaining a steep water potential gradient and thereby increasing the rate of water loss from the leaf.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n*   **Option A (1 and 3):** This option is incorrect because oxygen concentration (3) does not have a direct, significant effect on the rate of transpiration. While carbon dioxide concentration (1) does influence transpiration, the inclusion of oxygen concentration makes this choice invalid.\n\n*   **Option B (1 and 4):** While wind speed (4) is a correct factor, this option is less accurate than D. Carbon dioxide concentration (1) affects the rate of transpiration by influencing the opening and closing of stomata. Stomata open to allow CO\u2082 uptake for photosynthesis; if CO\u2082 levels are very high, stomata may partially close, reducing water loss. However, temperature (2) has a more direct physical effect on the rate of evaporation itself, which is the core of the transpiration process. Therefore, the combination of temperature and wind speed represents two of the primary physical factors governing the transpiration rate.\n\n*   **Option C (2 and 3):** This option is incorrect. Although temperature (2) is a key factor affecting transpiration, oxygen concentration (3) is not. The concentration of atmospheric oxygen has no direct role in regulating the rate of water vapour diffusion from the leaves."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_463.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "23 the diagram shows part of a blood vessel.\nkey\n\u2014 direction of\nblood flow\n\nwhich evidence in the diagram shows that it is a vein and not an artery?\na there is a valve inside the blood vessel.\nb_ blood is flowing in an upwards direction.\nc_ the blood vessel has a relatively small lumen.\nd_ the blood vessel has a relatively thick wall.", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nVeins are blood vessels that carry blood towards the heart. This blood is at a relatively low pressure and often has to flow against the force of gravity, particularly in the limbs. To ensure that blood flows in one direction and to prevent it from flowing backwards, most veins are equipped with semi-lunar valves. These valves are flaps of tissue that open to allow blood to flow towards the heart and close if blood starts to flow in the opposite direction. Arteries, which carry high-pressure blood away from the heart, do not have valves (with the exception of the aortic and pulmonary arteries at the heart's exit). The presence of a valve in the diagram is therefore the key structural evidence that identifies the blood vessel as a vein.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Blood is flowing in an upwards direction.**\nThe direction of blood flow (e.g., upwards or downwards) is relative to the position of the blood vessel in the body and is not a feature that distinguishes arteries from veins. For example, blood flows upwards in the veins of the legs (returning to the heart) and also upwards in the carotid arteries (supplying the head). The fundamental difference is that arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, and veins carry blood *towards* the heart, regardless of the orientation within the body.\n\n**C: The blood vessel has a relatively small lumen.**\nThis statement describes a characteristic of an artery, not a vein. Veins have a relatively large or wide lumen (the central cavity) in proportion to their wall thickness. This large lumen reduces resistance to blood flow, which is important as the blood within veins is at low pressure. Arteries, in contrast, have a narrower lumen relative to their thick walls.\n\n**D: The blood vessel has a relatively thick wall.**\nThis statement describes a characteristic of an artery, not a vein. Arteries have thick, muscular, and elastic walls to withstand and maintain the high pressure of blood being pumped directly from the heart. Veins carry blood at a much lower pressure and therefore have thinner, less muscular walls compared to arteries of a similar size."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_464.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 the photomicrograph shows two blood cells.\nwhat is the function of these cells?\na __tocarry out phagocytosis\nb_ to produce antibodies\nc to transport oxygen\nd to transport vitamins", "Chapter": 9, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nRed blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are specialised cells whose primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues in the body. They contain a large quantity of a red, iron-containing protein called haemoglobin. In the high oxygen environment of the lungs, oxygen diffuses into the red blood cells and binds to haemoglobin, forming oxyhaemoglobin. When the blood reaches tissues with low oxygen concentration, the oxygen is released from the haemoglobin and diffuses into the tissue cells for aerobic respiration. The biconcave shape of red blood cells provides a large surface area-to-volume ratio, facilitating rapid diffusion of oxygen across the cell membrane.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing and digesting pathogens or cellular debris. This is a function of specific types of white blood cells, known as phagocytes (such as neutrophils and macrophages), which are part of the immune system. Red blood cells are not involved in phagocytosis.\n\n**B:** Antibodies are specialised proteins that are crucial to the adaptive immune response. They are produced by a type of white blood cell called a B-lymphocyte (specifically, by plasma cells, which are differentiated B-lymphocytes). Red blood cells lack a nucleus and the necessary organelles for protein synthesis and secretion, and therefore cannot produce antibodies.\n\n**D:** While the blood circulatory system is responsible for transporting substances like vitamins, this role is primarily carried out by the blood plasma, the liquid matrix of the blood.

This is because carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product during aerobic respiration in the body's cells. The standard laboratory test for carbon dioxide involves bubbling the gas through limewater, which is an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)\u2082). When carbon dioxide is present, it reacts with the calcium hydroxide to form calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083), a white, insoluble solid (precipitate). This precipitate makes the clear limewater turn cloudy or milky, confirming the presence of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** While carbon dioxide is a gas present in expired air, DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) is not the correct substance to test for it. DCPIP is a redox indicator that is blue when oxidised and becomes colourless when reduced. It is commonly used to test for the presence of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or in experiments investigating photosynthesis, not for identifying carbon dioxide.\n\n**C:** Oxygen is present in expired air (approximately 16%), but its presence is not tested for using DCPIP. DCPIP is a redox indicator used for other purposes, such as testing for Vitamin C. The standard test for oxygen gas is to see if it relights a glowing splint; it does not involve a reaction with DCPIP.\n\n**D:** Although oxygen is present in expired air, limewater is not used to test for it. Limewater (calcium hydroxide solution) specifically tests for the presence of carbon dioxide by forming a white precipitate of calcium carbonate.

As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of both the enzymes and the substrate molecules increases. This leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the enzyme's active site and the substrate, causing the rate of respiration to increase.\n2.  **Optimum Temperature:** The rate continues to increase until it reaches an optimal temperature, at which the enzyme exhibits maximum activity. This is represented by the peak of the curve.\n3.  **Rapid Decline:** Beyond the optimum temperature, the high temperature begins to break the weak bonds that maintain the enzyme's specific three-dimensional structure. This process, known as denaturation, changes the shape of the active site. The substrate can no longer bind effectively, and the rate of respiration decreases rapidly.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: A**\nThis graph suggests that the rate of anaerobic respiration is constant and completely independent of temperature. This is incorrect because anaerobic respiration is a metabolic pathway controlled by enzymes. The activity of enzymes is highly sensitive to changes in temperature, so the rate of reaction would not remain constant as temperature varies.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: C**\nThis graph shows that the rate of respiration is high at low temperatures, decreases to a minimum as temperature rises, and then increases again. This pattern is not characteristic of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The rate of an enzyme-controlled process like anaerobic respiration should be low at low temperatures and increase with temperature until the optimum is reached, not decrease.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer: D**\nThis graph shows a linear decrease in the rate of anaerobic respiration as temperature increases. This is incorrect. For an enzyme-controlled reaction, the rate should initially increase with temperature due to increased kinetic energy and more frequent enzyme-substrate collisions.

This generates a nerve impulse that travels along a sensory neurone from the receptor to the central nervous system (CNS), specifically the spinal cord.\n2.  **Relay Neurone:** Within the grey matter of the spinal cord, the sensory neurone passes the impulse to a relay neurone (or interneurone). This neurone serves as a connector, linking the sensory neurone to the appropriate motor neurone.\n3.  **Motor Neurone:** The relay neurone transmits the impulse to a motor neurone.

It is responsible for the 'fight-or-flight' response, which prepares the body for intense physical activity. One of the key effects of adrenaline is to increase the heart rate. This ensures that blood, carrying oxygen and glucose, is pumped more rapidly to the muscles and brain. This increased supply of reactants for aerobic respiration allows for a faster release of energy, enabling the body to respond quickly and powerfully to a perceived threat.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. decreased breathing rate**\nThis is incorrect. Adrenaline secretion leads to an *increase* in both the rate and depth of breathing. This physiological change enhances the uptake of oxygen from the air into the bloodstream, which is necessary to meet the increased metabolic demands of the muscles during a 'fight-or-flight' response.\n\n**B. decreased pupil diameter**\nThis is incorrect. Adrenaline causes the pupils of the eyes to *dilate* (increase in diameter). This allows more light to enter the eye, which sharpens vision and improves awareness of the surroundings. This is a crucial adaptation for assessing threats and planning an escape or a response.\n\n**C. development of secondary sexual characteristics**\nThis is incorrect.

The term is a composite of two Greek words: 'photo', meaning light, and 'tropos', meaning to turn or move. In plants, shoots typically exhibit positive phototropism, growing towards a light source to maximise the interception of light for photosynthesis. This response is mediated by the plant hormone auxin. When a shoot is exposed to unilateral light, auxin migrates to the shaded side, promoting cell elongation there. This differential growth rate causes the shoot to bend and grow towards the light.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. absorbing mineral ions**\n\nThis describes a process of nutrient uptake, not phototropism. The absorption of mineral ions from the soil is carried out by the root hair cells of a plant. This process, primarily occurring via active transport, is essential for providing the plant with the inorganic nutrients required for healthy growth, but it is not a directional growth response to a stimulus like light.\n\n**B. absorbing water**\n\nThis describes the process of water uptake, known as osmosis, not phototropism. Plants absorb water from the soil through their root hair cells. Water is crucial for various physiological processes, including maintaining turgor pressure, transport of substances, and as a reactant in photosynthesis. However, water absorption is a fundamental process of substance intake, not a directional growth movement in response to light.\n\n**C. directional growth in response to gravity**\n\nThis defines gravitropism (also known as geotropism), not phototropism. Gravitropism is a plant's directional growth in response to the stimulus of gravity. Plant shoots exhibit negative gravitropism (growing upwards, against gravity), while roots exhibit positive gravitropism (growing downwards, in the direction of gravity). While this is a type of tropism, the stimulus involved is gravity, whereas phototropism is a response specifically to light."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_470.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 a gardener wants to grow some new plants that are identical to plants that she already has.\nwhich method of reproduction is used, and how many parents are needed for her to grow some\nnew identical plants?\n\nmethod of number of\nreproduction parents needed\na asexual one\nb asexual two\ncc sexual one\nd sexual two", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAsexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction in which a new organism is produced from a single parent.

In horticulture, methods like taking cuttings, using runners, or grafting are common forms of asexual reproduction (also known as vegetative propagation) used to produce new plants that retain the exact same characteristics as the parent plant. Since the gardener wants new plants that are identical to the existing ones, this requires asexual reproduction, which involves only one parent plant.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option correctly identifies the method of reproduction as asexual, which is necessary to produce genetically identical offspring. However, it incorrectly states that two parents are needed. Asexual reproduction, by definition, involves only a single parent organism. The involvement of two parents is a characteristic of sexual reproduction.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically different from the parent(s). Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes, leading to genetic recombination and variation. This process does not produce identical offspring. Furthermore, while some plants can self-pollinate (a form of sexual reproduction involving one individual), the key outcome is still genetic variation, not identical clones.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because sexual reproduction, which typically involves two parents, creates genetic variation in the offspring.

The process begins with the seed absorbing water, a phenomenon known as imbibition. This influx of water causes the seed to swell, which can rupture the protective outer seed coat (testa). More importantly, water activates enzymes within the seed. These enzymes are crucial for breaking down the complex, insoluble food reserves (such as starch and proteins) stored in the cotyledons or endosperm into simpler, soluble substances (like glucose and amino acids). These soluble nutrients are then transported to the embryo to provide the energy and building materials needed for respiration and growth, allowing the radicle (embryonic root) and plumule (embryonic shoot) to emerge.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. chlorophyll:** Chlorophyll is the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their own food using light energy. However, a seed does not perform photosynthesis. It relies on a pre-existing food store within itself. Chlorophyll is only synthesized, and photosynthesis only begins, after the seedling has successfully germinated, emerged from the soil, and its first leaves are exposed to light. Therefore, chlorophyll is a product of successful growth *after* germination, not a requirement *for* germination.\n\n**B. light:** While light is essential for the continued growth of most plants after germination, it is not always necessary for the germination process itself. In fact, many seeds germinate best in darkness, as they are typically buried in the soil. For some plant species, light can even inhibit germination. Although some seeds (e.g., lettuce) do require light to trigger germination, it is not a universal condition that must *always* be present.\n\n**C. soil:** Soil provides support, water, and mineral nutrients for a developing plant, but it is not essential for the act of germination. A seed can germinate successfully without soil as long as it has access to the necessary conditions, primarily water, oxygen, and a suitable temperature. This can be demonstrated by germinating seeds on moist cotton wool, paper towels, or in hydroponic systems.

A gene's primary role is to provide the template for a protein's amino acid sequence. The synthesis and breakdown of fats are metabolic processes that are controlled by enzymes. Since enzymes are proteins, genes indirectly influence fat metabolism by coding for the specific enzymes required for these biochemical reactions. However, the structure of a fat molecule itself is not directly determined by a sequence of nucleotides in a gene.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nStarch is a complex carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide made up of many glucose units linked together. Genes do not contain a direct code for the structure of starch. Instead, genes code for the proteins, specifically enzymes, that are necessary to synthesise starch. For example, the enzyme starch synthase, which is a protein, catalyses the reaction that joins glucose molecules to form a starch chain. Therefore, genetic information controls the production of starch indirectly, by providing the instructions to build the necessary enzymatic machinery.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nSugars, such as glucose, are simple carbohydrates. They are fundamental molecules used for energy and as building blocks for more complex molecules. The chemical structure of a sugar molecule is not directly specified by a gene. Genes carry the instructions to build proteins. The metabolic pathways that produce and break down sugars, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration, are controlled by a series of enzymes. Each of these enzymes is a protein, and the gene for each enzyme dictates its structure and function. Thus, genes control the presence and concentration of sugars in a cell indirectly."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_477.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "37 when white-flowered pea plants are crossed with red-flowered pea plants, the offspring plants all\nhave red flowers.\nif these offspring plants are crossed, the next generation of plants contains both red-flowered and\nwhite-flowered plants.\nwhich statement explains this?\na_ the allele for red flowers is dominant, and the offspring plants are heterozygous.\nb_ the allele for red flowers is dominant, and the offspring plants are homozygous.\nc_ the allele for red flowers is recessive, and the offspring plants are heterozygous.\nd_ the allele for red flowers is recessive, and the offspring plants are homozygous.", "Chapter": 16, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis scenario describes a classic Mendelian monohybrid cross.\n\n1.  **Dominance:** When a red-flowered plant is crossed with a white-flowered plant, all the resulting offspring (the F1 generation) have red flowers. This indicates that the allele for red flowers is **dominant**, as it masks the expression of the allele for white flowers. The white flower allele is therefore **recessive**.\n\n2.  **Genotype of the Offspring:** The F1 generation plants inherited one allele from each parent. They received the dominant allele for red flowers from the red-flowered parent and the recessive allele for white flowers from the white-flowered parent. This means their genotype consists of one dominant and one recessive allele, making them **heterozygous**.\n\n3.  **Confirmation in the Next Generation:** When these heterozygous F1 plants are crossed, the recessive allele for white flowers can combine in the next generation (F2), causing the white-flowered trait to reappear. This confirms that the F1 plants were heterozygous carriers of the recessive allele.\n\nTherefore, the allele for red flowers is dominant, and the F1 offspring plants are heterozygous.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. The allele for red flowers is dominant, and the offspring plants are homozygous.**\nWhile it is correct that the allele for red flowers is dominant, it is incorrect that the offspring (F1 generation) are homozygous. A homozygous organism has two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., two dominant or two recessive alleles). Since the F1 offspring came from a cross between a red-flowered and a white-flowered plant, they must have inherited an allele from each. To produce a white-flowered plant, that parent must be homozygous recessive. Thus, the F1 offspring must have inherited a recessive allele, making them heterozygous, not homozygous.\n\n**C. The allele for red flowers is recessive, and the offspring plants are heterozygous.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the allele for red flowers is dominant, not recessive. If the red allele were recessive, it would only be expressed in the homozygous state. When crossed with a dominant white-flowered plant, the F1 generation would all show the dominant white phenotype, which contradicts the observation that all offspring have red flowers.\n\n**D. The allele for red flowers is recessive, and the offspring plants are homozygous.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons.

For a feature to be considered adaptive, it must meet two key criteria, both of which are included in this definition.\n1.  **It must be an inherited characteristic:** This means the feature is determined by the organism's genes and can be passed down from parents to offspring. Acquired characteristics, such as learned behaviours or physical changes due to an individual's lifestyle, are not adaptive features in an evolutionary sense.\n2.  **It must help an organism to survive and reproduce:** The feature must increase an organism's fitness\u2014its ability to live long enough in its specific environment to produce viable offspring. For example, the thick white fur of a polar bear is an inherited characteristic that provides camouflage and insulation, increasing its chances of surviving and reproducing in the Arctic.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. the differences between individuals of the same species**\nThis phrase describes **variation**. Variation is the presence of different alleles and, consequently, different phenotypes within a population. While variation is the essential raw material upon which natural selection acts, it is not the definition of an adaptive feature. An adaptive feature is a specific variation that confers a survival or reproductive advantage, not the concept of variation itself.\n\n**C. the genetic make-up of an organism**\nThis is the definition of **genotype**. The genotype is the entire set of genes an organism possesses. While an adaptive feature has a basis in an organism's genotype, the genotype itself is not the adaptation.

In virtually all ecosystems, there is a progressive decrease in total biomass at each successive trophic level. This is because a significant amount of energy (approximately 90%) is lost at each transfer between levels, primarily through metabolic processes like respiration, and not all of the organism is consumed or digested.\n\nIn the given food chain (tree \u2192 caterpillar \u2192 bird), the tree is the producer and forms the base of the pyramid. A single tree possesses a very large biomass. The caterpillars, as primary consumers, feed on the tree. Although there may be many caterpillars, their total combined biomass will be significantly less than the biomass of the single tree. The birds, as secondary consumers, feed on the caterpillars. The total biomass of the bird population supported by these caterpillars will be smaller still. Therefore, the correct pyramid of biomass is upright, with the largest bar at the bottom (tree), a smaller bar in the middle (caterpillar), and the smallest bar at the top (bird), as shown in diagram A.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B:** This diagram shows a spindle-shaped pyramid, where the biomass of the primary consumers (caterpillars) is greater than that of the producers (tree). While a pyramid of *numbers* for this food chain could be inverted (e.g., many thousands of caterpillars on one tree), a pyramid of *biomass* is almost always upright. The total mass of a single large producer like a tree is far greater than the total mass of the herbivores that feed on it. Therefore, this representation is incorrect.\n\n**C:** This diagram shows a completely inverted pyramid, where biomass increases at each successive trophic level. This arrangement is biologically impossible. It suggests that a smaller biomass of caterpillars can support a larger biomass of birds, and a smaller biomass of a tree can support a larger biomass of caterpillars. This violates the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of energy transfer in ecosystems, as biomass and energy are always lost when moving up the food chain.\n\n**D:** This diagram correctly shows that the producer (tree) has the largest biomass. However, it incorrectly depicts the biomass of the secondary consumers (birds) as being greater than the biomass of the primary consumers (caterpillars).

Offspring produced through these programmes can later be reintroduced into protected areas in the wild to help restore the natural population. This method has been crucial in preventing the extinction of numerous species.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** Climate change is a significant threat to biodiversity and is a major cause of species endangerment. It alters habitats, disrupts food webs, and changes environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and rainfall patterns) faster than many species can adapt. For example, rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, endangering reef ecosystems, while melting arctic ice threatens the survival of polar bears. Therefore, climate change *increases*, rather than reduces, the number of endangered species.\n\n**C:** Habitat protection is a cornerstone of conservation. It involves legally protecting natural areas from destruction or degradation caused by human activities like deforestation, agriculture, and urbanisation.

All mammals, from whales to bats to humans, possess hair at some stage of their life cycle.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nAmphibians are a class of vertebrates characterised by their smooth, moist, permeable skin, which lacks any form of hair, feathers, or scales. Their skin is rich in glands that secrete mucus, which helps to keep it moist. This moistness is crucial as many amphibians engage in cutaneous respiration, meaning they absorb oxygen directly through their skin.

The biuret reagent turns from its original blue colour to purple or violet in the presence of peptide bonds, which link amino acids together to form proteins. The result in the table shows a purple colour, confirming the presence of protein. The DCPIP (dichlorophenolindophenol) test is used to detect vitamin C (ascorbic acid). DCPIP is a blue indicator that becomes colourless when it is reduced by vitamin C. The result shows that the DCPIP solution became colourless, which is a positive test for vitamin C. The iodine test, which tests for starch, was negative as the solution remained yellow-brown instead of turning blue-black. Therefore, the food sample contains both protein and vitamin C.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: protein only**\nThis option is incorrect because it only accounts for one of the positive test results. While the purple colour in the biuret test correctly indicates the presence of protein, this option ignores the result from the DCPIP test. The decolourisation of the blue DCPIP solution is a positive result, confirming that vitamin C is also present in the food sample.\n\n**C: starch and reducing sugar**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the test for starch using iodine solution yielded a negative result. Iodine solution remains yellow-brown in the absence of starch; it only turns blue-black if starch is present. Secondly, no test for reducing sugar, such as the Benedict's test, was performed. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the presence of either starch or reducing sugar.\n\n**D: starch and vitamin C**\nThis option is incorrect because the test for starch was negative.

Stomach proteases, such as pepsin, are adapted to the highly acidic environment of the stomach. In the absence of acid, the pH would be close to neutral, significantly reducing the enzyme's activity and leading to a very slow rate of digestion.\n\n**B:** This test-tube is missing the protease enzyme. While it contains the protein substrate and the correct acidic conditions and temperature, enzymes are required as biological catalysts to speed up the rate of digestion. Without the enzyme, the breakdown of protein by acid alone is a negligible and extremely slow process. This setup serves as a control to demonstrate that the acid itself does not cause rapid digestion.\n\n**D:** In this test-tube, the protease has been boiled. Boiling an enzyme causes it to denature. Denaturation is the process where the specific three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including its active site, is irreversibly altered by high temperatures.

This model states that the enzyme's active site has a unique, three-dimensional shape that is precisely complementary to the shape of its specific substrate. Substrate D has a shape that perfectly matches and fits into the active site of the enzyme shown. This complementary fit allows for the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex, which is the necessary first step for the enzyme to catalyse its reaction.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A.** An enzyme-substrate complex is formed when a substrate binds specifically to the enzyme's active site. The indentation in molecule A is complementary to the overall shape of the entire enzyme, not just its active site. For a reaction to be catalysed, the substrate must fit into the active site, not the other way around. Therefore, molecule A cannot act as the substrate for this enzyme.\n\n**B.** This molecule has an internal cavity whose shape is complementary to the entire enzyme molecule. This would imply that the enzyme fits inside molecule B. However, the mechanism of enzyme action involves the smaller substrate molecule binding to the specific active site on the larger enzyme molecule. Molecule B does not have the correct shape to bind to the enzyme's active site.\n\n**C.** This molecule has a shape that is identical, not complementary, to the enzyme molecule. For an enzyme-substrate complex to form, the substrate's shape must complement the active site's shape, like a key fitting into a lock.

The chemical equation for this process is:\n\n6CO\u2082 (carbon dioxide) + 6H\u2082O (water) \u2192 (in the presence of light energy) \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 (glucose) + 6O\u2082 (oxygen)\n\nIn the experiment shown, the aquatic plant is supplied with light and is submerged in water, which contains dissolved carbon dioxide. These are the necessary conditions for photosynthesis. As the plant photosynthesizes, it releases bubbles of gas. This gas, a product of the reaction, is collected in the inverted test tube. Therefore, the most abundant gas produced and collected is oxygen.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. carbon dioxide**\nCarbon dioxide is a reactant, not a product, of photosynthesis. The plant absorbs and uses the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water to carry out photosynthesis. While plants also respire (a process that releases carbon dioxide), in the presence of light, the rate of photosynthesis is significantly higher than the rate of respiration. This means there is a net consumption of carbon dioxide and a net production of oxygen.\n\n**B. methane**\nMethane (CH\u2084) is not produced by plants during photosynthesis or respiration. It is primarily produced by the decomposition of organic matter by certain types of bacteria under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions. This process is not relevant to the experiment shown.\n\n**C. water vapour**\nWhile the collected gas will contain some water vapour due to evaporation from the water surface, it will not be the most abundant gas. The substantial volume of gas that has displaced the water in the test tube is a result of the active biological process of photosynthesis. The gas produced by this process, oxygen, will be present in a much larger quantity than the water vapour."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_494.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "14 the graph shows how the percentage of protein found in potatoes was affected by the\n\nconcentration of nitrate fertiliser added to the crop when it was growing.\n\npercentage\n\nof protein\n\nin potatoes\n\nconcentration of\nnitrate fertiliser added\n\nusing the information in the graph, which molecule do the potatoes make more of when the\nconcentration of nitrate fertiliser increases?\na amino acids\nb_ cellulose\nc sfat\nd starch", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A amino acids**\n\nPlants absorb mineral ions from the soil, including nitrates.

Proteins are large polymers constructed from smaller monomer units called amino acids. All amino acids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Therefore, for a plant to synthesise more protein, it must first synthesise more amino acids, for which a supply of nitrogen is essential. The increased availability of nitrates allows the potato plant to produce more amino acids, which are then assembled into proteins.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B cellulose**\n\nCellulose is a complex carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide. It is the primary structural component of plant cell walls. The elements that make up cellulose are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Cellulose does not contain nitrogen. Therefore, the availability of nitrate fertiliser, a source of nitrogen, does not directly affect the rate of cellulose synthesis.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C fat**\n\nFats, also known as lipids, are organic molecules used for energy storage and as components of cell membranes. Fats are composed primarily of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They do not contain nitrogen.

Its primary function is to serve as a temporary storage site for feces, which are the indigestible waste products of digestion that have been formed in the colon. When the rectum is filled, stretch receptors in its walls are stimulated, triggering nerve impulses that lead to the urge to defecate. This structure is therefore responsible for holding waste material before it is egested from the body.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This structure is the small intestine, a long and highly coiled tube situated between the stomach and the large intestine. The small intestine is the primary site for the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, and for the absorption of the resulting soluble nutrients (such as glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol) into the bloodstream. This absorptive and digestive function is distinct from the role of the rectum.\n\n**B:** This structure is the large intestine, also known as the colon. Its principal function is the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested food matter. This process solidifies the liquid waste into feces. While the rectum is the terminal part of the large intestine, the main sections of the colon are responsible for processing waste and reabsorbing water, rather than the final storage of feces before elimination.\n\n**D:** This structure is the appendix, a small, finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine).

While some absorption occurs, it is not the principal site for the absorption of digested nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats). Therefore, damage to the colon would primarily disrupt water balance, leading to diarrhoea, but it would not be the region most affected concerning the absorption of digested food.\n\n**C. oesophagus**\nThe oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food from the pharynx to the stomach via a process called peristalsis. No significant chemical digestion or absorption of nutrients occurs in the oesophagus. Its function is purely transit. Consequently, damage to the oesophagus would not affect the absorption of digested food.\n\n**D. stomach**\nThe primary roles of the stomach are the mechanical mixing of food and the chemical digestion of proteins by the enzyme pepsin in a highly acidic environment.

This absorption is directly linked to the absorption of nutrients. As digested food molecules, such as glucose and amino acids, and mineral ions are actively transported from the lumen of the small intestine into the bloodstream, they lower the water potential of the blood. This creates a water potential gradient, causing water to follow the solutes and move by osmosis from the intestinal lumen into the blood. The structure of the small intestine, with its great length and vast surface area provided by villi and microvilli, is highly adapted to maximise the absorption of both nutrients and water.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) colon:** The colon, which is the main part of the large intestine, does absorb water. Its primary role is to absorb the remaining water from indigestible food matter, thereby compacting the waste into faeces. However, the volume of water absorbed in the colon is significantly less than the volume absorbed in the small intestine, as most water has already been absorbed along with the nutrients before the chyme reaches the large intestine.\n\n**B) rectum:** The rectum is the final section of the large intestine. Its primary function is to store faeces before they are expelled from the body. While it is part of the large intestine, its role in water absorption is negligible compared to both the colon and the small intestine.\n\n**D) stomach:** The stomach's main functions are the storage of food and the initial digestion of proteins. The stomach wall is largely impermeable to water, and very little absorption of any substance occurs here. In fact, the stomach secretes large amounts of acidic gastric juice, which is primarily water, into its lumen to aid digestion.

This response involves several types of white blood cells with distinct functions.\n\n1.  **Antibody Production:** One major type of white blood cell is the lymphocyte. When a pathogen enters the body, specific B-lymphocytes recognise the foreign antigens on the pathogen's surface. These B-lymphocytes are stimulated to divide and differentiate into plasma cells, which then produce and release large quantities of specific antibodies. These antibodies circulate in the blood and help neutralise or mark the pathogens for destruction. Therefore, an increase in the number of white blood cells (specifically lymphocytes) leads to an increase in the number of antibodies.\n\n2.  **Phagocytosis:** Another key type of white blood cell is the phagocyte (e.g., neutrophils and macrophages). These cells are responsible for engulfing and digesting pathogens in a process called phagocytosis. When an infection occurs, the body produces more phagocytes, which are attracted to the site of infection. An increased number of white blood cells means more phagocytes are available to destroy the invading pathogens.\n\nBoth increased antibody production and increased phagocytosis are direct consequences of the proliferation of white blood cells to combat an infection.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis option is incorrect because, while an increase in white blood cells does lead to an increase in antibodies (Reason 1), it does not cause an increase in the number of platelets (Reason 4). Platelets (or thrombocytes) are cell fragments in the blood whose primary function is to initiate blood clotting at the site of an injury to prevent blood loss. Their numbers do not increase as a primary mechanism to fight pathogens. The immune response to pathogens specifically involves the proliferation of white blood cells, not platelets.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis option is incorrect because, while an increase in white blood cells does lead to an increase in phagocytosis (Reason 3), it does not increase the transport of oxygen (Reason 2). The transport of oxygen in the blood is the primary function of red blood cells, which contain the protein haemoglobin that binds to oxygen.

Air travels from the trachea into the bronchi, which then divide repeatedly into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles are the finest airways that permeate the lung tissue. They terminate in tiny, clustered air sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Therefore, the bronchioles are the structures that connect directly to the alveoli, delivering inhaled air to the site of gas exchange.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. bronchus**\nThe bronchi (singular: bronchus) are the two large airways that branch off from the bottom of the trachea, leading into the right and left lungs.

These cells secrete hormones that regulate blood glucose concentration. Specifically, the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans produce and secrete insulin. When blood glucose levels rise, for example, after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle cells to take up glucose from the blood and convert it into glycogen for storage. This process lowers the blood glucose concentration, maintaining it within a normal physiological range.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. adrenaline**\nAdrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. It is not produced by the pancreas.

The term itself is composed of 'photo', meaning light, and 'tropism', which refers to a turning or growth movement. Plant shoots (the stems and leaves) exhibit positive phototropism, meaning they grow towards a light source. This is an essential survival mechanism that maximizes the exposure of leaves to sunlight, which is necessary for photosynthesis. This response is controlled by a plant hormone called auxin. When light shines on a shoot from one side, auxin accumulates on the shaded side, promoting faster cell elongation there. This differential growth causes the shoot to bend and grow towards the light source.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** A chemical produced by a plant is a general term for substances like hormones (e.g., auxin), pigments (e.g., chlorophyll), or sugars (e.g., glucose). While a plant chemical (auxin) is responsible for mediating the phototropic response, the chemical itself is not the response. Phototropism is the observable growth movement, not the molecule that regulates it.\n\n**B:** A painful sensation is a response characteristic of animals, which possess a nervous system and specialized pain receptors (nociceptors). Plants lack a nervous system and do not experience pain. They respond to stimuli, including damage, through biochemical and electrical signals that trigger physiological changes, but this is fundamentally different from the sensation of pain.\n\n**C:** The growth of a plant root towards the centre of the Earth is an example of gravitropism (or geotropism). This is a growth response to the stimulus of gravity, not light. Plant roots typically show positive gravitropism, growing downwards to anchor the plant and access water and nutrients in the soil. While this is a type of tropism, the stimulus is incorrect for it to be classified as phototropism."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_507.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "27 the graph shows changes in the resistance of the bacterium escherichia coli to two different\nantibiotics between 2005 and 2023.\n25\neger geese secs\n20 for predentin gantibiot 1\neere eee ehs seer nseree\neee eere eee eee eeeeeeeepes hh\nf 1s eeesereree eee i:\nseer lor eeepeeeeceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee cee antibot\nbacteria resistant | eereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eee eee ehh antibiotic 2\nto.an antibiotic 40-feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee dpe bpeeee hee peeeeeeeh\npeel ar peer\ncocr cce etc coee eee eee\noau runes 9 zu hues rugs taret ores ogeoeruogrtorese\neeeee eee eee-eeeeeeeeee eee eeeeee ceh\nct\n(0) er do a gi a ae a cn a\n2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023\nyear\nwhich statement describes the changes that occurred between 2005 and 2023?\na_ between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of bacteria resistant to antibiotic 2 increased by 6%.\nb between 2011 and 2016, the percentage of bacteria resistant to antibiotic 1 continually\nincreased.\nc between 2016 and 2023, the percentage of bacteria resistant to antibiotic 2 continually\ndecreased.\nd_ between 2020 and 2022, the percentage of bacteria resistant to antibiotic 2 decreased.", "Chapter": 15, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Rationale for the Correct Answer\n\n**A.

The male gamete (e.g., sperm in animals, pollen grain nucleus in plants) and the female gamete (e.g., egg cell or ovum) are both haploid, meaning they each contain half the number of chromosomes of a typical body cell. When these two gametes fuse, their haploid nuclei combine to form a single diploid nucleus in a new cell called a zygote. This zygote contains a full set of chromosomes, with half contributed from each parent, and will develop into a new organism.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. two eggs**\nAn egg cell (or ovum) is the female gamete. Fertilisation involves the fusion of one female gamete with one male gamete. The fusion of two egg cells does not occur in natural fertilisation and would not result in a viable offspring, as it would lack the essential genetic material from the male parent.\n\n**B. two embryos**\nAn embryo is a multicellular organism in its early stage of development. It forms after a zygote undergoes repeated mitotic cell divisions. Therefore, an embryo is a *result* of fertilisation and subsequent growth, not a participant in the initial fusion process. Fertilisation creates the zygote, which then develops into an embryo.\n\n**D. two zygotes**\nA zygote is the single diploid cell that is formed as the immediate product of fertilisation, resulting from the fusion of the two gamete nuclei.

Insect-pollinated flowers have evolved specific features to maximize the efficiency of pollen transfer by insects. Their pollen grains are relatively large and are often coated with a sticky substance or have spiky surfaces. This adaptation ensures that the pollen grains readily adhere to the insect's body (such as its legs, back, or head) when it visits the flower to feed on nectar. The pollen is then reliably transported to the stigma of the next flower the insect visits.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect\n\n**Statement 1: Anthers in wind-pollinated flowers are inside the flower.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Wind-pollinated flowers are adapted for pollen dispersal by air currents. To facilitate this, their anthers are typically large and hang outside the main flower structure on long, flexible filaments. This exposed position allows the wind to easily pick up and carry away the light, smooth pollen grains. Anthers located inside the flower would be shielded from the wind, making this method of pollination ineffective.\n\n**Statement 3: The stigma in insect-pollinated flowers is outside the flower.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In insect-pollinated flowers, the stigma is positioned inside the flower, strategically placed so that a visiting insect is likely to brush against it. The stigma is also typically sticky to ensure that any pollen carried by the insect is successfully transferred and adheres. It is in wind-pollinated flowers that the stigma is large, feathery, and hangs outside the flower to create a large surface area for trapping airborne pollen."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_510.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "30 which structure is found in both animals and plants?\na cornea\nb_ ovary\nc_sepal\nd_ stamen", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe ovary is a reproductive structure found in both the animal and plant kingdoms.

Sperm cells are gametes, which are haploid, meaning they contain half the number of chromosomes as somatic cells.

In males, the X and Y chromosomes separate, so that approximately half of the sperm cells produced will receive an X chromosome, and the other half will receive a Y chromosome.

A cell containing both an X and a Y chromosome would be diploid in terms of its sex chromosomes, which is characteristic of a male's somatic cells, not his gametes. The presence of both sex chromosomes in a single gamete would be due to a meiotic error known as non-disjunction and is not the normal state.\n\n**C. only X chromosomes**\nThis statement is incorrect because males have both X and Y chromosomes (XY).

A waste product of their respiration is carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere. Thus, decomposition *adds* carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\n\n**D. respiration**\nCellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of all living organisms (including plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The overall process involves breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. This release of carbon dioxide as a waste product means that respiration *adds* carbon dioxide to the atmosphere."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_517.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 the graph shows how the population of the world has increased over time.\n7\n: p\n5\nworld\n\u2018 4\npopulation\n/billions 3\n2\n|\n0\n1700 1800 1900 2000\nyear\nwhich growth curve phase is represented by region p?\na_ death phase\nb_ exponential (log) phase\nc_ lag phase\nd _ stationary phase", "Chapter": 19, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**B. exponential (log) phase**\n\nThis is the correct answer. The exponential phase, also known as the logarithmic or log phase, is characterized by a rapid and accelerating rate of population growth. During this phase, the birth rate is significantly higher than the death rate, and there are few, if any, limiting factors restricting growth. Region P on the graph clearly depicts this phenomenon; the curve becomes extremely steep, indicating that the human population is increasing by a larger amount each year. This surge is largely attributed to advances in medicine, sanitation, and agriculture, which have drastically lowered death rates and increased the carrying capacity of the environment for humans.\n\n**A. death phase**\n\nThis is incorrect. The death phase of a population growth curve occurs when the death rate exceeds the birth rate, leading to a decline in the total population. This would be represented on a graph by a downward-sloping curve. Region P shows a rapid and steep upward slope, indicating a significant increase, not a decrease, in population.\n\n**C. lag phase**\n\nThis is incorrect. The lag phase is the initial phase of population growth, characterized by a very slow rate of increase. During this time, the population is small and may be adapting to its environment. On the given graph, the lag phase would correspond to the earlier period (e.g., before 1800), where the curve is almost horizontal. Region P, in contrast, shows the fastest rate of growth on the entire graph.\n\n**D. stationary phase**\n\nThis is incorrect. The stationary phase occurs when the population growth rate slows to zero, and the population size becomes stable. This happens when limiting factors, such as resource scarcity or disease, cause the death rate to equal the birth rate. Graphically, this phase is represented by the curve flattening out into a horizontal line. The curve in region P is becoming steeper, indicating that growth is accelerating, not stabilising."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_518.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 how do herbicides help to increase food production?\na by increasing biodiversity\nb_bykilling insect pests\nc by providing nutrients\nd by reducing competition", "Chapter": 20, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nHerbicides are chemical substances specifically designed to kill unwanted plants, known as weeds. In an agricultural setting, these weeds compete with crop plants for essential limited resources, including sunlight, water, mineral ions (nutrients) in the soil, and physical space. By eliminating the weeds, the herbicide reduces this competition. As a result, the crop plants have access to a greater share of these resources, allowing them to grow healthier and more vigorously. This improved growth leads to a higher yield, thereby increasing food production.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) by increasing biodiversity**\nThis statement is incorrect. Biodiversity refers to the variety of different species in an ecosystem. Herbicides are used to kill specific types of organisms (weeds). By removing these plant species from a field, herbicides actually *decrease* the plant biodiversity of that area. This can also lead to a secondary reduction in the biodiversity of insects and other animals that depend on the weeds for food or shelter.\n\n**B) by killing insect pests**\nThis statement is incorrect. The substances used to kill insect pests are called insecticides. Herbicides are specifically formulated to be toxic to plants ('herba-' referring to plants, '-cide' meaning to kill), not insects. While both herbicides and insecticides are types of pesticides used to increase crop yield, they target different types of organisms.\n\n**C) by providing nutrients**\nThis statement is incorrect. Substances that are added to the soil to provide essential nutrients for plant growth (such as nitrates, phosphates, and potassium) are called fertilisers. Herbicides are toxins that disrupt vital plant processes like photosynthesis or growth; they are not a source of nutrition. While the removal of weeds by herbicides makes more nutrients available to the crops by reducing competition, the herbicide itself does not provide these nutrients."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_519.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "39 which product of anaerobic respiration in yeast is used as a biofuel?\na_ carbon dioxide\nb_ ethanol\nc_ glucose\ndoxygen", "Chapter": 12, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nAnaerobic respiration in yeast is a process called alcoholic fermentation. During this process, glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing a small amount of energy. The chemical equation is:\n\nGlucose \u2192 Ethanol + Carbon dioxide + Energy\n\nEthanol is a high-energy organic molecule that can be combusted (burned) to release a large amount of thermal energy. A biofuel is defined as a fuel derived from biological matter. Since ethanol is produced by a biological organism (yeast) and can be used as a fuel source (for example, in vehicles, often as a blend with petrol), it is classified as a biofuel.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A) carbon dioxide**\nCarbon dioxide is a waste product of anaerobic respiration in yeast. However, it is not a fuel. A fuel must be able to be combusted to release energy. Carbon dioxide is a fully oxidised molecule and cannot be burned. While it has commercial uses, such as in carbonating drinks and making bread rise, it cannot be used as a biofuel.\n\n**C) glucose**\nGlucose is the reactant, or substrate, for anaerobic respiration, not a product. Yeast consumes glucose as its energy source to carry out the process of fermentation. Therefore, the amount of glucose decreases during the reaction.\n\n**D) oxygen**\nAnaerobic respiration, by definition, is a process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is a reactant in aerobic respiration, a different metabolic pathway that produces carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is not produced during anaerobic respiration; its absence is a requirement for the process to occur."}, {"questionName": "ig_bio_p1_520.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0610_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "40 which statement describes genetic modification?\na_ changing the genetic material of an organism\nb_ changing the genetic material of plants only\nc producing new organisms through fertilisation\nd selective breeding of organisms", "Chapter": 21, "Level": "igCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "biology", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nGenetic modification, also known as genetic engineering, is the direct, deliberate alteration of an organism's genetic material (DNA). This process involves laboratory techniques to insert, delete, or modify specific genes to produce desired characteristics. This definition applies to all types of organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B: changing the genetic material of plants only**\n    This statement is too specific and therefore incorrect. While genetic modification is widely used in agriculture to create genetically modified (GM) crops, the technology is also applied to many other organisms. For example, bacteria are genetically modified to produce human insulin, and animals can be modified for research purposes or to produce pharmaceuticals.\n\n*   **C: producing new organisms through fertilisation**\n    This describes sexual reproduction, not genetic modification. Fertilisation is a natural process where male and female gametes fuse, combining genetic information from two parents to create a new, genetically unique individual. Genetic modification is an artificial process that directly alters the DNA within an organism's cells, rather than combining whole sets of chromosomes through reproduction.\n\n*   **D: selective breeding of organisms**\n    This describes artificial selection. Selective breeding is a process where humans choose parent organisms with desirable traits to breed, hoping the offspring will inherit and express those traits. This method works with the existing genetic variation within a population and does not involve the direct manipulation of genes in a laboratory. Genetic modification, in contrast, involves directly changing the DNA sequence itself, often introducing genes from a different species, which is not possible through selective breeding."}]
