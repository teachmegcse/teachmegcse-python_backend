It is defined as the number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year. A decrease in the birth rate means that fewer people are being added to the total population. This directly and immediately affects the rate of population growth. Even in the short run (e.g., within a single year), a lower birth rate results in a smaller total population than would have occurred otherwise. Therefore, the population is the variable most directly and immediately affected.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. inflation**\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. A decrease in the birth rate does not have a direct or immediate impact on inflation. In the long run, a lower birth rate could lead to a smaller future workforce, potentially constraining aggregate supply and putting upward pressure on wages and prices. However, in the short run, the number of babies born has no significant effect on the current levels of aggregate demand or supply, and thus no immediate impact on inflation.\n\n**C. supply**\nIn economics, supply refers to the quantity of goods and services that producers are willing and able to offer at various prices. A key factor of production that influences a country's aggregate (total) supply is the size of its labour force. A decrease in the birth rate will only affect the size of the labour force in the long run, typically after 16-25 years when those children would have entered the workforce. In the short run, the existing labour force, capital, and technology remain unchanged, so the economy's productive capacity is not affected.\n\n**D. unemployment**\nUnemployment refers to the number of people who are part of the labour force but are without a job and actively seeking employment. The labour force consists of the economically active population (typically those of working age). A decrease in the current birth rate has no impact on the current size of the labour force or the number of people seeking jobs. Any effect on the labour market would be a long-run phenomenon, occurring when the smaller generation reaches working age and enters the labour market. Therefore, unemployment is not affected in the short run."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_2.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 the diagram shows the choices for an individual between leisure and earnings.\n24\nhours of 909\nleisure\nperday 16\nx\n12\n\u00a5\n8\n4\n0\n20 40 60 80 100 120\nearnings $\nthe person decides to take a job that gives more leisure time.\nwhat is the opportunity cost to the individual of moving from position y to position x?\na $20\nb $80\nc 4hours of leisure per day\nd 12 hours of leisure per day", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nOpportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when an economic decision is made. In this scenario, the individual decides to move from position Y to position X. This choice involves gaining more leisure time. The opportunity cost is what the individual must give up to obtain this extra leisure.\n\nAt position Y, the individual has 8 hours of leisure and earns $80 per day. At position X, the individual has 12 hours of leisure and earns $60 per day.\n\nBy moving from Y to X, the individual gains 4 hours of leisure (12 hours - 8 hours). To achieve this gain, they must sacrifice earnings. The amount of earnings forgone is the difference between the earnings at Y and the earnings at X, which is $80 - $60 = $20. Therefore, the opportunity cost of gaining the additional 4 hours of leisure is the $20 of earnings that are no longer received.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B) $80**\nThis is incorrect. $80 represents the total earnings at position Y, not the amount of earnings given up to move to position X. Opportunity cost measures the value of what is sacrificed in a decision, which is the change in earnings, not the initial level of earnings.\n\n**C) 4 hours of leisure per day**\nThis is incorrect. The 4 hours of leisure represents the *gain* or benefit the individual receives from moving from position Y to position X. Opportunity cost is what is *forgone* or sacrificed, not what is gained. The cost of gaining these 4 hours of leisure is the lost earnings.\n\n**D) 12 hours of leisure per day**\nThis is incorrect. 12 hours of leisure is the total amount of leisure enjoyed at the new position, X.

It is correctly defined as the value of the **next best** alternative that is forgone when making a choice. When an economic agent (such as an individual, firm, or government) decides on a course of action, they simultaneously decide against pursuing other available options. The student's definition, \"the alternative given up,\" is inadequate because it is too general. There may be many alternatives given up, but the opportunity cost is specifically the value of the single most desirable of these forgone alternatives. For example, if a government chooses to spend money on building a new hospital, it gives up the alternatives of building a new school, a new road, or cutting taxes. If the new school was the most valued of these other options, then the opportunity cost of building the hospital is the forgone new school. The definition must stress the \"next best\" nature of the alternative to be precise.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: The type of economic system is not identified.**\nOpportunity cost is a universal economic concept that arises from the fundamental problem of scarcity. It applies in any economic system\u2014be it market, command, or mixed\u2014because in all systems, choices must be made about how to allocate limited resources. Therefore, the definition of opportunity cost does not need to specify an economic system to be valid.\n\n**C: There is no mention of money values.**\nOpportunity cost is not always measured in monetary terms. It represents the value of what is given up, which can be non-monetary. For instance, the opportunity cost of choosing to study for two hours could be the leisure time spent with friends that was given up. While the value of some alternatives can be expressed in money, it is not a necessary component of the definition. The core concept is about the forgone alternative itself, not its monetary equivalent.\n\n**D: There is no reference to finite resources and unlimited wants.**\nThe concepts of finite resources and unlimited wants explain *why* opportunity cost exists. This is known as the basic economic problem or scarcity. Because resources are limited and wants are unlimited, choices are necessary. Every choice involves a trade-off, which creates an opportunity cost. However, these concepts are the underlying cause of opportunity cost, not part of the definition of the term itself. The definition describes the consequence of a choice, not the conditions that necessitate the choice."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_4.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 the market for a good was in equilibrium. a change occurred which resulted in a new equilibrium\nwith a higher price for the good and a lower quantity traded.\nwhich change would have caused this?\na the demand curve moved to the left.\nb the demand curve moved to the right.\nc_ the supply curve moved to the left.\nd_ the supply curve moved to the right.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA leftward shift of the supply curve signifies a decrease in supply.

This occurs only in response to a change in the product's own price, assuming all other factors affecting demand remain constant (the *ceteris paribus* assumption). A rise in the price of the product leads to a contraction in quantity demanded (an upward movement along the curve), while a fall in price leads to an extension in quantity demanded (a downward movement along the curve). Therefore, a rise in the price of the product will result in a movement along the demand curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. a change in tastes**\nA change in consumer tastes or preferences is a non-price determinant of demand. Such a change causes a shift in the entire demand curve, rather than a movement along it. If tastes change in favour of a product, the demand curve will shift to the right, indicating more is demanded at every price. Conversely, if the product becomes less fashionable, the demand curve will shift to the left.\n\n**B. an increase in income**\nConsumer income is a non-price determinant of demand. A change in income leads to a shift in the demand curve. For a normal good, an increase in income causes the demand curve to shift to the right. For an inferior good, an increase in income would cause the demand curve to shift to the left. In either case, it is the entire curve that shifts, not a movement along the original curve.\n\n**D. a successful advertising campaign for the product**\nAdvertising is a non-price factor that influences demand by altering consumer tastes and raising awareness. A successful advertising campaign increases the desirability of a product, leading to an increase in demand at every price level.

The original demand curve is D\u2081, and a shift to the right moves it to D\u2083. The supply curve for new cars remains at S\u2081. The new market equilibrium is found at the intersection of the new demand curve (D\u2083) and the original supply curve (S\u2081), which is point Y.\n\n**Used Cars Market:** The scenario states that \"many used cars also came onto the market,\" which signifies an increase in the supply of used cars. This is shown by a rightward shift of the supply curve from S\u2081 to S\u2082. Additionally, new cars and used cars are substitute goods. Therefore, a significant increase in the demand for new cars will lead to a decrease in the demand for used cars, as consumers switch their preference.

This leads to a decrease in supply, represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve. As a result, the equilibrium price of the good increases, and the equilibrium quantity demanded decreases. This explains the second part of the answer: the quantity demanded of the good will decrease.\n\nThe effect on total expenditure depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED). Total expenditure is calculated as price multiplied by quantity (P x Q). The question states that the good has price-elastic demand, which means the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price (PED > 1).\n\nWhen the tax is imposed, the price increases. Because demand is price-elastic, consumers are very responsive to this price change. The resulting percentage decrease in quantity demanded will be larger than the percentage increase in price. Consequently, the fall in quantity outweighs the rise in price, causing the total expenditure on the good to decrease.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because an indirect tax raises the price of the good. According to the law of demand, a higher price leads to a decrease, not an increase, in the quantity demanded.\n\n**C:** This option correctly states that quantity demanded will decrease but incorrectly states that total expenditure will increase. Total expenditure only increases following a price rise if demand is price-inelastic (PED < 1), where the percentage increase in price is greater than the percentage decrease in quantity demanded. The question specifies that demand is price-elastic.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect on both counts.

This is determined by using the formula for the price elasticity of demand (PED).\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPrice elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. The formula is:\n\nPED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)\n\nIn this scenario, we are given:\n*   PED = 0.5\n*   The desired % Change in Quantity Demanded = 10%\n\nWe need to find the required % Change in Price.

The correct calculation requires dividing the change in quantity demanded by the PED.\n\n**B: 10%**\nA 10% price increase would only cause a 10% decrease in consumption if the price elasticity of demand were 1.0 (unit elastic). However, the PED is given as 0.5, indicating that demand is inelastic. This means consumers are not very responsive to price changes, so a larger percentage increase in price is needed to achieve the desired reduction in consumption.\n\n**C: 15%**\nThis answer is incorrect as it does not correspond to the correct calculation using the PED formula. A 15% increase in price, with a PED of 0.5, would only lead to a 7.5% reduction in consumption (15% \u00d7 0.5 = 7.5%), which falls short of the government's 10% target."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_9.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "9 the diagram shows the demand for and the supply of bread.\nprice\n<\np a a a ss ss ss\n' d\noo quantity\na maximum price p, is fixed by the government.\nwhat is likely to be the immediate result of this?\na  amovement of the demand curve to the right\nb  amovement of the supply curve to the right\nc_ ashortage of bread\nd asurplus of bread", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C. a shortage of bread**\n\nA maximum price, also known as a price ceiling, is a government-imposed limit on the price that can be charged for a good or service.

This curve shows the relationship between the wage rate and the number of hours an individual is willing to work.\n\nInitially, at lower wage rates, an increase in the wage rate leads to an increase in the quantity of labour supplied. This is because the **substitution effect** is dominant. The higher wage makes work more rewarding relative to leisure, so the opportunity cost of leisure increases. Individuals are incentivised to substitute leisure time for work time.\n\nHowever, as the wage rate continues to rise, a point is reached where the **income effect** starts to dominate the substitution effect. A higher wage means higher income, and since leisure is considered a normal good, people will want to consume more of it as their income rises. They can afford to work fewer hours and still maintain or improve their standard of living. Therefore, above a certain wage rate (and thus income level), the supply curve bends backwards, indicating that people choose to supply less labour (work fewer hours) in favour of more leisure time.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This graph shows that as the wage rate increases, the quantity of labour supplied also increases, and at an accelerating rate. This implies that the substitution effect is always stronger than the income effect, and individuals are continuously incentivised to work more as wages rise, without ever reaching a point where they prefer more leisure.\n\n**B:** This graph represents a perfectly inelastic supply of labour. The quantity of labour supplied is fixed and does not change, regardless of the wage rate. This might occur in situations where individuals are on fixed-hour contracts or where the number of hours they can work is constrained.

In economic terms, this is an increase in the supply of doctors, which can be graphically represented as a rightward shift of the supply curve for doctors.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. increased demand for doctors**\nThe demand for doctors is determined by factors such as the size and health needs of the population, the prevalence of illness, and the level of income and insurance coverage that enables people to seek medical care. Granting work permits to foreign doctors affects the number of doctors available (supply), not the underlying need or desire for medical services (demand).\n\n**B. increased productivity of doctors**\nProductivity refers to the output per unit of input, for instance, the number of patients a doctor can treat effectively in a given time. While some immigrant doctors may be highly skilled, allowing more of them into the country does not inherently increase the average productivity of all doctors. The primary effect is on the quantity of labour, not necessarily its efficiency.\n\n**C. increased salaries for doctors**\nSalaries in a labour market are determined by the interaction of supply and demand. An increase in the supply of doctors (more doctors competing for jobs), assuming demand remains unchanged, will put downward pressure on wages. With a larger pool of available doctors, employers have more choices and less need to offer higher salaries to attract candidates.

When a firm expands, it can produce a larger output. This increased output often allows the firm to reduce its long-run average cost (the cost per unit). This reduction occurs for several reasons, such as:\n*   **Technical economies:** Larger firms can invest in more advanced and efficient machinery.\n*   **Purchasing economies:** Firms can negotiate lower prices for raw materials by buying in bulk.\n*   **Managerial economies:** Larger firms can afford to hire specialist managers for different departments (e.g., finance, marketing), leading to greater efficiency.\n*   **Financial economies:** Larger, more established firms are often seen as less risky by banks and can secure loans at lower interest rates.\nTherefore, by definition, a firm that successfully expands to take advantage of economies of scale will experience a decrease in its average costs of production.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: Average costs of production will increase.**\nThis describes the concept of **diseconomies of scale**, which is the opposite of economies of scale. Diseconomies of scale occur when a firm grows so large that it becomes inefficient, causing its long-run average costs to rise. This can be due to problems with communication, coordination, and worker motivation in a very large organisation. The question specifies that the firm is expanding to *take advantage of economies of scale*, implying it is operating on the downward-sloping part of its long-run average cost curve, where costs are falling, not rising.\n\n**C: Profits will decrease.**\nThe primary motivation for a firm to expand and achieve economies of scale is to increase its efficiency and, consequently, its profitability. A decrease in the average cost of production means that the profit margin on each unit sold (Price - Average Cost) increases, assuming the price remains constant. While the initial expansion may involve significant investment costs, the intended long-term outcome of successfully achieving economies of scale is an increase, not a decrease, in overall profits.\n\n**D: The price of the firm's products will increase.**\nA firm's pricing decisions are influenced by its costs, market demand, and the level of competition. A decrease in average production costs does not automatically cause a firm to increase its prices. In fact, lower costs give the firm more flexibility. It might choose to lower its prices to attract more customers and gain market share from competitors, or it might keep its prices the same to enjoy a higher profit margin.

Average fixed cost falls.**\n\nAverage Fixed Cost (AFC) is calculated by dividing the Total Fixed Cost (TFC) by the quantity of output (Q). The formula is **AFC = TFC / Q**.\n\nIn this scenario, the Total Fixed Cost is constant at $1000, regardless of the level of output. As output (the denominator) increases, this constant fixed cost is spread over a larger number of units.\n\n*   At an output of 100, AFC = $1000 / 100 = $10.00\n*   At an output of 200, AFC = $1000 / 200 = $5.00\n*   At an output of 300, AFC = $1000 / 300 = $3.33\n*   At an output of 400, AFC = $1000 / 400 = $2.50\n\nAs the calculations demonstrate, with each increase in the level of output, the average fixed cost per unit continuously decreases. This principle is often referred to as 'spreading the overhead'.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Average fixed cost rises.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As demonstrated by the calculations above, Average Fixed Cost (AFC) is found by dividing a constant Total Fixed Cost (TFC) by an increasing level of output (Q). Mathematically, when the numerator of a fraction is constant and the denominator increases, the resulting value must decrease. Therefore, average fixed cost falls as output rises, it does not rise.\n\n**C. Average variable cost remains constant.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Average Variable Cost (AVC) is calculated by dividing the Total Variable Cost (TVC) by the quantity of output (Q). The formula is **AVC = TVC / Q**. Calculating the AVC for the given data shows that it is not constant:\n\n*   At an output of 100, AVC = $1000 / 100 = $10.00\n*   At an output of 200, AVC = $1500 / 200 = $7.50\n\nSince the AVC is $10.00 at one level of output and $7.50 at another, it does not remain constant.\n\n**D. Average variable cost rises.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect based on the data provided. Using the formula **AVC = TVC / Q**, the average variable cost can be calculated at each level of output:\n\n*   At an output of 100, AVC = $1000 / 100 = $10.00\n*   At an output of 200, AVC = $1500 / 200 = $7.50\n*   At an output of 300, AVC = $2000 / 300 = $6.67\n*   At an output of 400, AVC = $2500 / 400 = $6.25\n\nThe data shows that as output rises from 100 to 400 units, the average variable cost is continuously falling, not rising.

The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) is the standard measure used to track this general price level. The CPI calculates the weighted average of prices of a representative basket of consumer goods and services. When the CPI decreases over a period, it indicates that, on average, prices are falling.

The claimant count is a measure of unemployment, specifically tracking the number of individuals claiming unemployment-related benefits.

This is typically achieved by increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for both consumers and firms. This encourages consumers to take out loans for major purchases (like cars and houses) and firms to borrow for investment in new capital (like machinery and factories). The combined effect is an increase in consumption and investment, which leads to a rise in aggregate demand. In response to this higher demand for goods and services, firms will increase their production levels and are likely to expand their operations to meet this demand and maximise profits.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Borrowing by consumers falls as the money supply increases.**\nThis statement is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, which increases the money supply, leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and more attractive for consumers. As a result, consumer borrowing is likely to *increase*, not fall, as they are incentivised to finance consumption through credit.\n\n**C. Prices fall as total supply exceeds total demand.**\nThis statement describes the opposite effect of an expansionary monetary policy. The policy's primary goal is to increase total (aggregate) demand. When aggregate demand rises, it puts upward pressure on the general price level, potentially leading to inflation, especially if the economy is operating near its full capacity. Prices fall (deflation) when total demand is weak and is exceeded by total supply, a situation that expansionary policy aims to correct.\n\n**D. Wages rise due to a lower rate of inflation.**\nThis statement contains incorrect reasoning. Firstly, an expansionary monetary policy is likely to lead to a *higher*, not lower, rate of inflation due to the increase in aggregate demand. Secondly, while wages might rise during an economic expansion (as firms compete for more labour to increase production), this would be due to the increased demand for labour, not a lower rate of inflation.

This policy aims to increase aggregate demand, which is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. To achieve this, governments can lower taxes and increase their own spending. Lowering taxes on income and profits increases the disposable income of households and the retained profits of firms. This encourages more consumption and investment, both key components of aggregate demand. Simultaneously, an increase in government spending on public projects, services, and welfare directly injects money into the economy, further boosting aggregate demand and creating jobs. This combined approach is the most potent fiscal tool for combating a recession and promoting economic growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. lower taxes and decrease government spending**\n\nThis combination of policies has contradictory effects on aggregate demand. While lowering taxes is an expansionary measure designed to boost consumption and investment, decreasing government spending is a contractionary measure that directly reduces aggregate demand. The overall impact on the economy would be uncertain, depending on the relative magnitude of the tax cuts versus the spending cuts. Because the two policies work in opposition, this is not the most effective strategy to end a recession.\n\n**C. raise taxes and decrease government spending**\n\nThis combination represents a contractionary (or deflationary) fiscal policy. Raising taxes reduces the disposable income of households and the profits of firms, leading to lower consumption and investment. Decreasing government spending further reduces aggregate demand. This type of policy is typically implemented to slow down an overheating economy, control high inflation, or reduce a government budget deficit. Applying it during a recession would likely worsen the economic downturn, increase unemployment, and reduce economic growth.\n\n**D. raise taxes and increase government spending**\n\nThese policies have opposing effects on aggregate demand. Increasing government spending is expansionary, while raising taxes is contractionary. The tax increase would take money out of the private sector, dampening consumption and investment, while the government spending increase would inject it back into the economy. The net effect is ambiguous and generally less expansionary than simultaneously cutting taxes and increasing spending. This policy might be used to fund specific government projects without increasing the budget deficit, but it is not the most powerful tool for stimulating a recovery from a recession."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_21.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "21 the table shows taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product (gdp) for four countries.\nfrom this information, which country had the highest percentage of direct taxation as a percentage\nof gdp?\n\ntax on tax on goods\n' : tax on \u2018\nincome tax % business aue and services\n: dividends %\nprofits % %\na 12 14 2 5\nb 14 15 2 14\ncc tl 13 5 10\nd 18 10 1 10", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "***Correct Answer: C***\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nDirect taxation is levied on the income or profits of the person or company that pays it, and the burden cannot be shifted to others.

A core driver and outcome of this process is an increase in productivity. Productivity, which is the output per unit of input (such as labour or capital), rises due to several factors associated with development. These include investment in new technology and capital equipment, improvements in infrastructure, and a more skilled and educated workforce (an increase in human capital). As firms and the economy as a whole become more efficient, they can produce more goods and services with the same or fewer resources, which is the definition of increased productivity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: There will be an increase in the birth rate.**\nThis is incorrect. Empirical evidence and the demographic transition model show that as a country develops economically, its birth rate tends to fall. This decline is attributed to several factors, including increased access to education (particularly for women), greater female participation in the workforce, improved access to family planning, lower infant mortality rates (reducing the need for \"replacement\" children), and the higher costs associated with raising children in urbanised, developed economies.\n\n**C: There will be an increase in the death rate.**\nThis is incorrect. A key feature of economic development is a significant *decrease* in the death rate and a corresponding increase in life expectancy. Development leads to better healthcare services, improved sanitation and access to clean water, enhanced nutrition, and safer living and working environments. These advancements drastically reduce mortality from disease and accidents.\n\n**D: There will be reduced occupational mobility.**\nThis is incorrect. Economic development typically leads to *increased* occupational mobility, which is the ability of workers to move between different jobs and occupations. As an economy develops, there are greater opportunities for education and training, allowing individuals to acquire new skills for different roles. Furthermore, structural changes in the economy, such as the shift from the primary sector (agriculture) to the secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (services) sectors, necessitate and facilitate the movement of labour into new and emerging industries."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_23.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "23 which government policy would be most likely to reduce structural unemployment?\na adecrease in the rate of interest\nba decrease in the tax on goods and services\nc_anincrease in spending on education and training\nd_anincrease in tariffs on imported goods and services", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStructural unemployment arises from a fundamental mismatch between the skills possessed by the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. This often occurs due to technological advancements, changes in the structure of the economy (e.g., a shift from manufacturing to services), or geographical relocation of industries.\n\nAn increase in government spending on education and training is a supply-side policy that directly addresses the root cause of structural unemployment. By funding programmes that re-skill and up-skill workers, the government helps them acquire the new competencies that are in demand. This improves their occupational mobility, making it easier for them to transition from declining industries to growing ones, thereby reducing the skills mismatch and lowering structural unemployment.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a decrease in the rate of interest**\n\nThis is an expansionary monetary policy. Lowering interest rates encourages borrowing and spending by firms and consumers, which increases aggregate demand. While a boost in aggregate demand can reduce cyclical unemployment (unemployment caused by economic downturns), it does not solve the problem of a skills mismatch. Firms may wish to hire more workers, but if the unemployed do not have the required skills, they will remain jobless. Therefore, this policy is not the most effective way to reduce structural unemployment.\n\n**B: a decrease in the tax on goods and services**\n\nThis is an expansionary fiscal policy. Lowering indirect taxes (like VAT) increases consumers' real disposable income and encourages spending, thereby increasing aggregate demand. Similar to a decrease in the interest rate, this policy is designed to combat cyclical unemployment by stimulating economic activity. It does not, however, equip workers with the new skills needed to fill vacancies in a changing economy, and thus has little direct impact on structural unemployment.\n\n**D: an increase in tariffs on imported goods and services**\n\nThis is a protectionist trade policy. By increasing the price of imported goods, tariffs aim to make domestically produced goods more competitive, which may protect jobs in specific domestic industries facing foreign competition. However, this policy does not address the underlying skills mismatch. It merely props up potentially inefficient industries and may delay necessary economic adjustments.

The price level falls only when the rate of inflation is negative (deflation). A positive rate of inflation, even if it is decreasing (disinflation), still signifies that the overall price level is rising. In the period shown, the inflation rate was positive for the first three years, meaning the price level rose continuously during this time.

Net migration is the difference between the number of people immigrating (moving in) and emigrating (moving out).\n\n1.  **Calculate the rate of natural increase:**\n    *   Birth Rate = 25 per thousand\n    *   Death Rate = 15 per thousand\n    *   Rate of Natural Increase = Birth Rate - Death Rate = 25 - 15 = 10 per thousand.\n    This means for every 1,000 people in the town, the population grows by 10 people each year.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total population increase:**\n    *   The total population is 20,000. To find out how many 'thousands' this is, we divide: 20,000 / 1,000 = 20.\n    *   The total increase is the rate of natural increase multiplied by the number of 'thousands' in the population: 10 people \u00d7 20 = 200 people.\n\n3.  **Account for migration:**\n    *   The problem states that migration is balanced, meaning net migration is zero.

A population decreases when the death rate is higher than the birth rate. In this scenario, the birth rate (25 per 1,000) is higher than the death rate (15 per 1,000), leading to a natural increase.\n\n*   **B) 20,010:** This result is derived from incorrectly adding the rate of increase per thousand (10) directly to the total population (20,000 + 10). The rate of '10 per thousand' must be scaled to the full population size. The calculation fails to multiply the rate by the 20 'thousands' that make up the total population.\n\n*   **D) 22,000:** This figure represents an increase of 2,000 people, which would be a 10% growth rate. The actual rate of natural increase is 10 per thousand, which is equivalent to 1% (10 \u00f7 1,000 = 0.01). A 1% increase on a population of 20,000 is 200, not 2,000.

By restricting the supply of imported goods, a quota increases the market price of those goods. This policy is typically used to protect domestic producers in a particular industry from foreign competition, allowing them to sell more of their own products at a higher price than they would in a free market.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a government grant to encourage production**\nThis describes a subsidy, not a quota. A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or firm) with the aim of promoting economic and social policy. In the context of trade, governments may give subsidies to domestic producers to lower their production costs, making their goods more competitive against cheaper imports. This is a different protectionist measure from a quota, which directly limits the volume of imports.\n\n**C. a tax on imports**\nThis describes a tariff (or customs duty). A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other countries. While both tariffs and quotas are tools of protectionism designed to restrict imports, they operate differently. A tariff increases the price of imported goods, making them less attractive to consumers, whereas a quota imposes a direct physical limit on the quantity of goods that can be imported, regardless of price.\n\n**D. an administrative and technical barrier**\nThis refers to a different category of trade restrictions known as non-tariff barriers (NTBs). These include complex regulations, excessive paperwork, stringent product safety or quality standards, and other bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult or costly for foreign producers to import their goods. While these barriers restrict trade, they are distinct from a quota, which is a straightforward quantitative limit on the volume of imports."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_29.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "29 what is an advantage of a floating exchange rate for an economy?\na_itcan correct a current account deficit or surplus.\nb it creates certainty for firms importing goods.\nc_ it increases government control of the economy.\nd_ it stops money flows into and out of the economy.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA key advantage of a floating exchange rate is its ability to function as an automatic stabiliser for the balance of payments on the current account. If an economy has a current account deficit (where the value of imports exceeds the value of exports), there will be an excess supply of its currency on the foreign exchange market. This excess supply will cause the currency to depreciate (fall in value). A weaker currency makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and makes imports more expensive for domestic consumers. This shift in relative prices encourages exports and discourages imports, thereby helping to automatically correct the deficit. Conversely, a current account surplus would lead to an appreciation of the currency, which would help to reduce the surplus.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. It creates certainty for firms importing goods.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A floating exchange rate is determined by market forces of supply and demand, leading to frequent and often unpredictable fluctuations. This volatility creates uncertainty for firms involved in international trade. For an importer, the final cost of goods in their domestic currency can change between the time an order is placed and when payment is due, which increases financial risk. Certainty is an advantage more commonly associated with a fixed exchange rate system.\n\n**C. It increases government control of the economy.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A pure floating exchange rate system reduces direct government control over the exchange rate. The government and central bank do not intervene in the foreign exchange market to manage the currency's value. This is in contrast to a fixed or managed exchange rate system, where the central bank must actively buy or sell currency to maintain a target rate, representing a greater degree of direct control.\n\n**D. It stops money flows into and out of the economy.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A floating exchange rate does not stop international money flows; it responds to them. The very mechanism of a floating rate depends on the free flow of money for trade (current account transactions) and investment (financial account transactions). The demand for and supply of a currency, which determine its price, are created by these flows. Preventing money flows would require capital controls, which are a separate policy and not an inherent feature of a floating exchange rate regime."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_31.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "1 what causes economic agents to make choices?\na limited needs and wants\nb the existence of finite resources\nc the existence of free goods\nd_ the market mechanism", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe fundamental economic problem is scarcity, which arises because human wants are unlimited while the resources available to satisfy these wants are finite. Finite resources\u2014such as land, labour, capital, and raw materials\u2014are limited in supply. Because it is impossible to produce all the goods and services that everyone desires, economic agents (individuals, firms, and governments) are forced to make choices. They must decide how to allocate these limited resources among competing uses, determining which needs and wants to satisfy and which to leave unsatisfied. This necessity of choice is the foundation of the study of economics.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: limited needs and wants**\nThis statement is incorrect because a core assumption in economics is that human needs and wants are unlimited. While an individual's want for a specific good at a specific time might be satisfied, their overall desires for more or better goods and services are considered endless. If needs and wants were limited, and resources were sufficient to meet them all, the problem of scarcity would not exist, and there would be no need to make choices.\n\n**C: the existence of free goods**\nFree goods are those that are not scarce, meaning they are abundant enough to be available to everyone without limit and have a zero opportunity cost (e.g., air to breathe). The existence of such goods does not force economic agents to make choices. In fact, it is the opposite; because they are not scarce, no decision-making is required for their consumption. Choices are necessitated by the existence of *economic goods*, which are scarce and have an opportunity cost.\n\n**D: the market mechanism**\nThe market mechanism is a system that allocates resources through the interaction of supply and demand, which determines prices. While it is a primary way that choices are coordinated and resolved in a market economy, it is not the fundamental *cause* of choice itself. The market mechanism is a *response* to the problem of scarcity.

In this scenario, the government faces a choice due to scarce resources (a limited budget). By deciding to spend an extra $10bn on healthcare, it must give up the opportunity to spend that same $10bn on something else. The next best alternative that is explicitly given up is defence. Therefore, the reduction in defence expenditure is the opportunity cost of the increased spending on healthcare. This decision perfectly illustrates the trade-off inherent in resource allocation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. expansionary monetary policy**\n\nThis is incorrect. Monetary policy refers to actions undertaken by a central bank to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or restrain economic activity. Expansionary monetary policy typically involves lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply. The scenario describes a decision about government spending, which is an element of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Furthermore, since the increased spending on healthcare is financed by a decrease in defence spending, the total level of government expenditure remains unchanged, so it is not an expansionary fiscal policy either.\n\n**B. increased spending on a public good**\n\nThis is an incomplete description of the event, not the underlying economic concept. While healthcare and defence can be considered public or merit goods, simply stating that spending on one has increased ignores the crucial second part of the decision: that the funding comes from reducing spending elsewhere. The core economic principle at play is not just the provision of a public good, but the choice and sacrifice made to provide it, which is the essence of opportunity cost.\n\n**D. the operation of the market mechanism**\n\nThis is incorrect. The market mechanism refers to the process by which the forces of supply and demand determine prices and allocate resources in an economy. The decision described is an example of government intervention, where a central authority (the government) is directly allocating resources according to its priorities, rather than allowing market forces to do so.

This perfectly represents a contraction in demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: K to M**\nThis movement represents an extension (or expansion) of demand, not a contraction. An extension of demand occurs when the quantity demanded increases due to a fall in the price of the good. The movement from point K down to point M along the demand curve D\u2081 shows a decrease in price leading to an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\n**C: L to K**\nThis movement involves a shift from one demand curve (D\u2082) to another (D\u2081). A shift of the entire demand curve represents a change in demand, not a change in the quantity demanded. Specifically, the movement from D\u2082 to D\u2081 is a shift to the left, which signifies a decrease in demand. This means that at any given price, consumers are now willing and able to buy less than before.

Direct taxes, such as corporation tax, are levied on the profits of a firm, not on the production or sale of individual units. The supply curve illustrates the quantity of a good a producer is willing and able to offer at various price levels, *ceteris paribus* (all other things being equal). This willingness is determined by the costs of production per unit. Since a tax on profits does not alter the cost of producing each additional unit, it does not shift the supply curve. While it reduces the final profit retained by the firm, it does not change the production cost structure that underlies the supply schedule.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. changes in costs of production**\nA change in the costs of production is a primary determinant of supply and directly causes the supply curve to shift. If costs of production (such as wages, raw material prices, or energy bills) increase, it becomes less profitable for firms to produce the same quantity at any given price. Consequently, firms will supply less, causing the supply curve to shift to the left (a decrease in supply). Conversely, a decrease in production costs would make production more profitable, leading to an increase in supply and a rightward shift of the supply curve.\n\n**C. changes in indirect taxes**\nAn indirect tax (such as Value Added Tax - VAT or an excise duty) is a tax imposed by the government on goods and services. Firms treat indirect taxes as an additional cost of production. An increase in an indirect tax raises the cost of supplying each unit of a product. This reduces the profitability at any given price, causing producers to supply less, which shifts the supply curve to the left. A reduction in an indirect tax would lower production costs and shift the supply curve to the right.\n\n**D. changes in a subsidy from the government**\nA subsidy is a payment from the government to a producer to encourage the production of a particular good or service. A subsidy effectively lowers a firm's costs of production. By receiving a subsidy, a firm can produce each unit more cheaply, increasing profitability at any given price. This incentivises the firm to increase its output, causing the supply curve to shift to the right (an increase in supply). The removal or reduction of a subsidy would have the opposite effect, increasing costs and shifting the supply curve to the left."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_36.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "6  forhealth reasons, consumers decide that they want to eat more vegetables and less meat.\nwhat price signals would the market system send to reallocate resources so that consumers get\nwhat they want?\n\nprice of price of\nvegetables meat\n\na decrease decrease\n\nb decrease increase\n\ncc increase decrease\n\nd increase increase", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA change in consumer preferences is a non-price determinant of demand. When consumers decide to eat more vegetables, the demand for vegetables increases. This is represented by a rightward shift in the demand curve for vegetables. With the supply of vegetables remaining constant in the short run, this increase in demand leads to a higher equilibrium price. This higher price acts as a signal to producers, indicating increased profitability and incentivising them to allocate more resources (such as land, labour, and capital) to vegetable production to meet the new consumer wants.\n\nConversely, as consumers decide to eat less meat, the demand for meat decreases. This is represented by a leftward shift in the demand curve for meat. With the supply of meat constant in the short run, this decrease in demand leads to a lower equilibrium price. This lower price signals to meat producers that the product is less profitable, discouraging production and causing resources to be reallocated away from the meat industry. Therefore, the price of vegetables will increase, and the price of meat will decrease.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Price of vegetables decrease, price of meat decrease:** This is incorrect because an increase in consumer desire for vegetables would lead to an increase, not a decrease, in their price. A lower price for vegetables would signal to producers to supply *less*, which is the opposite of what is required to meet the change in consumer demand.\n\n**B. Price of vegetables decrease, price of meat increase:** This is incorrect for two reasons. An increase in demand for vegetables causes their price to rise, not fall. A decrease in demand for meat causes its price to fall, not rise. These price signals would lead to the opposite reallocation of resources from what is needed; fewer resources would go to vegetables and more to meat.\n\n**D. Price of vegetables increase, price of meat increase:** This is incorrect because the decrease in consumer demand for meat would lead to a surplus at the original price, causing the price to fall, not rise.

A key benefit of this shift is the promotion of efficiency. In a market economy, firms are driven by the profit motive and face competition. To maximise profits and survive in a competitive environment, firms have a strong incentive to minimise their costs of production. This can be achieved by using resources more efficiently, adopting new technologies, and improving management techniques. In contrast, state-owned enterprises in a mixed economy may lack these competitive pressures and the strong profit motive, potentially leading to higher operating costs.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. less inequality**\nThis is incorrect. A move towards a market economy is more likely to increase income and wealth inequality. In a pure market system, rewards are based on the market value of an individual's contribution, which can lead to large disparities. Mixed economies typically feature government intervention aimed at reducing inequality, such as progressive taxation and social welfare systems (e.g., unemployment benefits, state pensions). As an economy moves towards a market system, these redistributive mechanisms are often reduced, which can widen the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n**B. more nationalisation**\nThis is incorrect. Nationalisation is the process of the government taking ownership and control of private sector assets and industries. A move from a mixed economy to a market economy involves the opposite process, known as privatisation. Privatisation is the sale of state-owned enterprises to the private sector, which is a core policy for reducing government intervention and increasing the scope of the market.\n\n**C. more public goods**\nThis is incorrect. Public goods, such as national defence and street lighting, are typically not provided by the private sector due to the free-rider problem (where people can benefit without paying). They are usually funded by the government through taxation. A move towards a market economy generally involves a smaller role for the government, including lower government spending and taxation.

The relationship between PED and a firm's total revenue (Price \u00d7 Quantity) determines the outcome of a price change.\n\nA PED of 0.0 signifies **perfectly inelastic demand**. This means that the quantity demanded by consumers does not change at all, regardless of any change in price. If the firm doubles the price of its product, and the quantity sold remains constant, its total revenue will also double. This represents the maximum possible increase in revenue from a price increase, as there is no reduction in sales to offset the higher price.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) -0.5:** A PED of -0.5 signifies **inelastic demand** because its absolute value is less than 1. When demand is inelastic, an increase in price leads to a proportionally smaller decrease in quantity demanded. Therefore, increasing the price will increase total revenue. However, because the quantity demanded does fall (unlike with perfectly inelastic demand), the increase in revenue will be less than the increase achieved when PED is 0.0.\n\n**C) -1.0:** A PED of -1.0 signifies **unitary elastic demand**. This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. If the firm doubles its price (a 100% increase), the quantity demanded will fall by 100% (to zero, or in the case of a constant elasticity function, it will halve). In either interpretation used at this level, the effect of the price increase is perfectly offset by the decrease in quantity sold. As a result, total revenue remains unchanged; it does not increase.\n\n**D) -2.0:** A PED of -2.0 signifies **elastic demand** because its absolute value is greater than 1. When demand is elastic, an increase in price leads to a proportionally larger decrease in quantity demanded. If the firm doubles its price, the quantity sold will fall by a greater percentage. The loss in revenue from the sharp drop in sales will be greater than the gain in revenue from the higher price, causing total revenue to decrease."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_40.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "10 the table shows information about four financial institutions.\nwhich institution is most likely to be a commercial bank?\ntise . it is owned by\ngovernment's\nshareholders\nbank\n\na no no\n\nb no yes\n\nc yes no\n\nd yes yes", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA commercial bank is a private sector financial institution. Its primary objective is to generate profit for its owners. As a private entity, a commercial bank is owned by its **shareholders**, who have invested capital in the enterprise. In return for their investment, shareholders expect to receive profits in the form of dividends and capital gains.\n\nThe functions of a commercial bank, such as accepting deposits from the public and making loans to individuals and businesses, are distinct from the functions of a central bank. The central bank acts as the **government's bank**, managing public accounts and implementing monetary policy. A commercial bank does not fulfill this role. Therefore, an institution that is owned by shareholders but is not the government's bank is most likely a commercial bank.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** A defining characteristic of a commercial bank is its ownership structure; it is a for-profit corporation owned by shareholders. An institution that is not owned by shareholders cannot be a typical commercial bank. This ownership structure might correspond to a non-profit financial institution like a credit union or a mutual savings bank, which are owned by their members (depositors) rather than by external investors seeking profit.\n\n**C:** An institution that functions as the government's bank is the **central bank**. The central bank is a key part of the public sector, responsible for managing the country's money supply, setting interest rates, and acting as the banker to both the government and the banking system. Central banks are typically state-owned and do not have private shareholders, as their goal is to ensure economic stability, not to maximise private profit. This description fits a central bank, not a commercial bank.\n\n**D:** This combination of characteristics is inconsistent with the standard models of financial institutions. The role of the \"government's bank\" is fulfilled by the central bank, which is a public institution focused on policy objectives.

A steel producer operates at an earlier stage of the production process. A car producer operates at a later stage, turning the steel into a finished product.

A smartphone producer buys a computer chip producer.**\nThis describes a **backwards vertical merger**. A computer chip is a component used to make a smartphone, meaning the chip producer is at an earlier stage of the production process (a supplier). When a smartphone producer buys its chip supplier, it is integrating backwards along the supply chain to control the supply and cost of its key inputs.\n\n**C.

This raises the value of each worker to the employer, as the firm's potential revenue from hiring that worker increases. The demand for labour is a derived demand, meaning it is determined by the productivity of the worker and the value of the goods they produce. Consequently, with higher productivity, firms are willing to hire more workers at every given wage rate. This causes the demand for labour curve to shift to the right. The initial equilibrium is at point X, on demand curve D2 and supply curve S1. An increase in demand for labour is represented by a rightward shift from D2 to D1. The supply of labour, which is determined by the number of workers willing and able to work at different wage rates, is not directly affected by the change in productivity. Therefore, the supply curve remains at S1. The new equilibrium point is where the new demand curve (D1) intersects the original supply curve (S1), which is point A.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nPoint B represents a new equilibrium where both the demand for labour and the supply of labour have increased (shifted to the right), from D2 to D1 and S1 to S2, respectively. While an increase in labour productivity does cause the demand for labour to shift to the right (from D2 to D1), it does not cause an increase in the supply of labour. A shift in the supply curve to S2 would imply that more people are willing to work as farm workers at each wage rate, which might be caused by factors such as immigration or a change in non-wage benefits, not by an increase in productivity itself.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nPoint C represents a new equilibrium where the demand for labour has decreased (shifted to the left) from D2 to D3, while the supply of labour has remained unchanged at S1. A decrease in the demand for labour would occur if workers became less productive or if the price of the goods they produce fell. The question states that labour productivity has increased, which would increase, not decrease, the demand for labour. Therefore, a shift to D3 is incorrect.\n\n**Incorrect Answer: D**\n\nPoint D represents a new equilibrium where the supply of labour has decreased (shifted to the left) from S1 to S3, while the demand for labour has remained unchanged at D2. A decrease in the supply of labour means fewer workers are available at each wage rate. This could be caused by factors like workers moving to other industries or a fall in the working-age population. An increase in labour productivity affects the demand for labour, not the supply of it. Therefore, a shift in the supply curve to S3 and no change in the demand curve is an incorrect representation of the situation."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_43.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13. which service is most likely to be supplied by a small business?\na _ banking\nb_ dental treatment\nc_ energy distribution\nd rail travel", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nDental treatment is a service commonly provided by small businesses, such as sole traders or partnerships. A dental practice typically serves a local market and operates on a relatively small scale. While it requires significant investment in specialised equipment and professional qualifications for the staff, the barriers to entry and capital requirements are substantially lower than for industries that require national infrastructure.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: banking**\nThe banking sector is characterised by extremely high barriers to entry. These include the need for substantial capital reserves to meet strict government regulations, the high cost of establishing a secure network of branches and sophisticated digital platforms, and the need to build widespread public trust. Consequently, the market is dominated by large national or multinational corporations, making it unsuitable for small businesses.\n\n**C: energy distribution**\nEnergy distribution is considered a natural monopoly due to the prohibitively high costs of duplicating infrastructure. Building and maintaining a network of power lines or gas pipelines to serve a region or country requires massive capital investment. The scale of operation is vast, and there are significant economies of scale. This industry is typically managed by a few very large, often state-owned or heavily regulated companies, not small businesses.\n\n**D: rail travel**\nThe rail travel industry involves immense fixed costs and high barriers to entry. It requires enormous capital investment in building and maintaining infrastructure such as tracks, stations, and signalling systems, as well as purchasing and servicing rolling stock (trains). Operating a rail network efficiently requires a large-scale, coordinated operation. For these reasons, rail services are provided by large corporations, often operating as public entities or under government franchise, not by small businesses."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_44.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 when a firm produces 100 units, its total variable cost is $1000 and its total fixed cost is $4000.\nwhat is the firm\u2019s average total cost?\na $10 b_ $30 cc $40 d $50", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation**\n\nAverage Total Cost (ATC) is calculated by dividing the Total Cost (TC) by the quantity of output (Q).

These **barriers to entry** mean the monopolist does not face the threat of new competition. In a competitive market, if existing firms are earning high (supernormal) profits, this signals an opportunity to new firms. They will enter the market, increasing the total market supply, which in turn drives down the market price. This process continues until profits are reduced to a 'normal' level, where there is no longer an incentive for new firms to enter. Because a monopolist is protected by barriers to entry, it can set a price above its costs and maintain these supernormal profits in the long run without fear of them being competed away.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: It is a price-taker.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A price-taker is a firm that must accept the prevailing market price; it has no power to influence it. This is a characteristic of a firm in a perfectly competitive market, not a monopoly. A monopolist is a **price-maker** (or price-setter), meaning it has significant market power to influence the price of its good or service by adjusting the quantity it supplies. This price-making ability is a source of its profitability, not a constraint.\n\n**C: It is protected by the government.**\nWhile government protection (such as through patents, copyrights, or exclusive licenses) is one significant type of barrier to entry that can create a monopoly, it is not the only one. Monopolies can also arise from other barriers, such as control over a key resource, or from significant economies of scale that create a 'natural monopoly'. Therefore, stating that it can restrict the entry of new firms (Option A) is a more general and encompassing explanation that covers all types of monopolies, not just those created by government action.\n\n**D: Its total costs are usually low.**\nThis is not necessarily true. A monopolist's costs can be high or low depending on the industry and technology. While a 'natural monopoly' exists because one firm can achieve lower average costs than multiple firms due to massive economies of scale, this is a specific case. Other monopolies might have high research and development or production costs. More importantly, low costs alone do not guarantee sustained high profits. Even a low-cost firm in a competitive market would see its high profits eroded by new entrants. The crucial factor is the ability to maintain a price well above average cost, which is only possible due to barriers to entry."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_47.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "17 aneconomy is experiencing a period of deflation with lower output and rising unemployment.\nwhich policy measure would the government be most likely to use to correct this?\na_ improve education and training\nb increase interest rates\nc_ reduce income tax\nd reduce unemployment benefits", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn economy facing deflation, lower output, and rising unemployment is in a recessionary period, characterised by a significant deficiency in aggregate demand. The appropriate government response is to implement an **expansionary fiscal policy** to stimulate spending and economic activity.\n\nReducing income tax is a key tool of expansionary fiscal policy. This measure increases the disposable income of households (the income remaining after taxes). With more money available, households are likely to increase their consumption of goods and services. This rise in consumption boosts aggregate demand, encouraging firms to increase production (output) and hire more workers to meet the higher demand, thereby reducing unemployment. The overall increase in demand also puts upward pressure on the price level, helping to combat deflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. improve education and training**\nThis is a **supply-side policy**, not a demand-side policy. While improving education and training can increase the productivity and skills of the labour force, leading to higher long-run economic growth, it is a long-term strategy. It does not provide the immediate boost to aggregate demand needed to address a short-term crisis of falling output, rising unemployment, and deflation. The problem described is a cyclical downturn requiring immediate stimulus, which supply-side policies are not designed to provide.\n\n**B. increase interest rates**\nThis is a **contractionary monetary policy**. Increasing interest rates makes borrowing more expensive for both consumers and businesses. This discourages spending on credit (consumption) and reduces business investment. The overall effect is a reduction in aggregate demand. Implementing this policy would worsen the recession, leading to even lower output, higher unemployment, and more severe deflation. It is the opposite of the policy required to correct the situation.\n\n**D. reduce unemployment benefits**\nReducing unemployment benefits would lower the income of those out of work. As the unemployed typically spend most of their income on essential goods and services, a reduction in benefits would lead to a decrease in overall consumption and a fall in aggregate demand. This would further depress the economy, exacerbating the problems of low output and deflation.

As GDP represents the total income of a country, economic growth leads to a rise in national income. Income per head (or per capita income) is the average income per person in a country. It is calculated by dividing the national income by the total population. When national income increases due to economic growth, and assuming the population does not grow at a faster rate, the income per head will rise. This increase in average income is a key indicator of improving living standards.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. cyclical unemployment**\nCyclical unemployment is caused by a downturn in the business cycle, where a lack of aggregate demand in the economy leads to firms laying off workers. Economic growth, by contrast, represents an expansionary phase of the business cycle. During periods of growth, aggregate demand is rising, leading firms to increase production and hire more labour. Therefore, economic growth is associated with a *decrease* in cyclical unemployment, not an increase.\n\n**C. the budget deficit**\nA budget deficit occurs when government expenditure is greater than its tax revenue. During a period of economic growth, government finances tend to improve. As incomes and company profits rise, government tax revenues from sources like income tax, corporation tax, and sales taxes naturally increase. Simultaneously, government spending on unemployment benefits and other social support often decreases as more people find employment. This combination of higher revenue and lower expenditure is likely to *reduce* a budget deficit or create a budget surplus, not increase the deficit.\n\n**D. the stock of natural resources**\nThe stock of natural resources refers to the total amount of resources like minerals, fossil fuels, and forests available in a country. Economic growth involves increasing production, which typically requires greater use and consumption of these natural resources as inputs. This process, especially if not managed sustainably, leads to the depletion or a *decrease* in the stock of finite natural resources, not an increase."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_49.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 aneconomy has a high rate of inflation.\nwhich monetary policy measure is required to reduce inflation?\na adepreciation of its currency against the us dollar\nb_anincrease in the money supply\nc_anincrease in the rate of interest\nd_anincrease in the basic rate of income tax", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn increase in the rate of interest is a form of contractionary monetary policy used by a central bank to combat high inflation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive for both consumers and firms. This discourages spending on goods and services (consumption) and reduces investment by businesses. Simultaneously, a higher interest rate makes saving more attractive, encouraging households to save rather than spend.

When a currency depreciates, it becomes weaker relative to other currencies. This makes imported goods and raw materials more expensive, which can lead to cost-push inflation. Additionally, a weaker currency makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which can increase demand for exports and raise the overall aggregate demand, contributing to demand-pull inflation.\n\n**B: an increase in the money supply**\nAn increase in the money supply is an expansionary (or reflationary) monetary policy, which is used to stimulate economic growth, not to reduce inflation. Increasing the amount of money in circulation tends to lower interest rates and make credit more easily available, which encourages spending and investment. This leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which would put further upward pressure on prices and exacerbate inflation. To fight inflation, a central bank would typically decrease the money supply.\n\n**D: an increase in the basic rate of income tax**\nAn increase in the rate of income tax is a tool of fiscal policy, not monetary policy.

Supply-side policies are government measures designed to increase the productive capacity of the economy, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right.\n\n1.  **Improved education and training:** This is a key interventionist supply-side policy. By investing in education and training, the government improves the skills and qualifications of the workforce (i.e., enhances human capital). This makes workers more productive and employable, particularly benefiting low-skilled and unemployed individuals. As their skills improve, they can command higher wages, which raises their incomes and reduces the gap between the highest and lowest earners in society. Therefore, this policy helps to make the distribution of income more equal.\n\n3.  **Reduction in the basic rate of income tax:** This is a market-based supply-side policy. Reducing the basic rate of income tax increases the disposable income of those on lower and middle incomes. This acts as an incentive for people to work, or to work more hours, as they keep a larger proportion of their earnings. By encouraging more people, especially the unemployed or low-paid, to participate in the labour market, it can raise their pre-tax incomes. This increase in earnings at the lower end of the income scale can help to narrow the overall income gap, contributing to a more equal distribution of income.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n**A, B, and D are incorrect** primarily because they include deregulation (statement 2) as a measure that makes income distribution more equal, which is generally not the case.\n\n*   **Deregulation (statement 2):** Deregulation is a supply-side policy that involves removing or reducing government controls on industries to promote competition and efficiency. However, it often leads to a *less equal* distribution of income. For example, deregulation might involve weakening the power of trade unions or abolishing minimum wage laws. While such measures might reduce costs for businesses, they can also lead to lower wages and poorer working conditions for low-skilled workers.

They are defined by two key characteristics:\n1.  **Non-rivalry:** One person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others to consume. For example, one person benefiting from a streetlight does not prevent others from doing the same.\n2.  **Non-excludability:** It is impossible or prohibitively costly to prevent individuals who do not pay for the good from consuming it. For instance, it is not feasible to exclude a non-taxpayer from the protection of national defence.\n\nThese characteristics create the \"free-rider problem,\" where individuals can benefit from a good without contributing to its cost. Consequently, private firms have no profit incentive to supply public goods, as they cannot charge consumers for using them. In a mixed economy, the government provides these goods and finances them through compulsory taxation to overcome this market failure.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: free goods**\nFree goods are not scarce and have no opportunity cost associated with their production or consumption. They are naturally abundant, such as air or sunlight. The goods described in the question are provided by the government, which means scarce resources (labour, capital) are used to produce them, and thus they have an opportunity cost. Therefore, they are economic goods, not free goods.\n\n**B: economic goods**\nAn economic good is any good or service that is scarce relative to the demand for it, and therefore has an opportunity cost. While public goods are a type of economic good, this term is too general. The category of economic goods also includes private goods (like cars and food) and merit goods (like education), which markets *can* and *do* provide. The question asks for the specific name of goods that markets *cannot* provide due to their unique characteristics, which is \"public goods.\"\n\n**C: merit goods**\nMerit goods are goods that are beneficial for an individual and society (they have positive externalities), but which would be under-consumed if left to the free market. This is often due to information failure, where consumers do not fully appreciate the long-term benefits. Examples include healthcare and education. A key distinction is that markets *can* and *do* provide merit goods (e.g., private schools and hospitals). The government intervenes not because the market *cannot* provide them, but because it believes the market provides an insufficient quantity.

This signifies that, on average, households dedicated a larger percentage of their total spending to clothing in year 2 compared to year 1.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. food prices were higher in year 2 than in year 1**\nThis conclusion cannot be drawn. The CPI weights reflect the proportion of expenditure, not the price levels of the items themselves. The weight for food increased from 33 to 33.5, meaning a greater proportion of income was spent on it. However, this could be because consumers bought more food, or because food prices rose relative to other goods. The table does not provide information on prices, so no conclusion about price levels can be made.\n\n**B. people spent less on transport in year 2 than in year 1**\nThis statement refers to the absolute amount of money spent, which cannot be determined from the data. The weight for transport decreased from 18 to 17.5, indicating that a smaller *proportion* of total expenditure was spent on transport.

While the *proportion* of expenditure on food increased (from 33 to 33.5), it is possible that total household expenditure decreased.

Income inequality measures how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population. The data shows that between year 1 and year 2, the share of total national income received by the highest 20% of households increased from 50% to 53%. Conversely, the share of income received by the lowest 20% of households decreased from 5% to 2%. The widening gap between the share of income held by the richest and the poorest segments of the population is a clear indicator of rising income inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. The number of households in the highest 20% has increased.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the household income groups are defined as fixed percentages (quintiles) of the total number of households in the country. The 'highest 20%' group, by definition, always contains one-fifth of the total households. The table shows a change in this group's *share of income*, not a change in the *number of households* that constitute the group.\n\n**C. The proportion of households in absolute poverty has increased.**\n\nThis conclusion cannot be drawn from the data provided. Absolute poverty is a condition where household income is below a necessary level to maintain basic living standards, defined by a fixed real income threshold. The table only shows the *percentage share* of income, not the absolute value of that income or the total income of the country. It is possible that the country's total income grew so substantially that even with a smaller share (2% instead of 5%), the absolute real income of the lowest 20% of households actually increased. Without information on the change in total national income and the absolute poverty line, it is impossible to determine the change in absolute poverty.\n\n**D. The proportion of households in relative poverty has fallen.**\n\nThis statement is contradicted by the data. Relative poverty is defined as having an income below a certain proportion of the median or average income in a country. The data indicates that income inequality has increased: the share of income going to the lowest-income households has fallen, while the share going to the highest-income households has risen. This means the incomes of the poorest households have decreased *relative* to the average, making them poorer in comparison to the rest of society.

When a country has more immigrants (people moving into the country) than emigrants (people moving out of the country), it experiences positive net migration. This influx of people directly adds to the total population, contributing to a higher rate of population growth, regardless of the natural rate of increase.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: The average years of schooling is relatively high.**\nThis is unlikely to cause high population growth. There is a well-established inverse correlation between the level of education in a population, particularly among women, and the fertility rate. Higher levels of education are often associated with greater career opportunities, delayed marriage and childbirth, and better knowledge and use of family planning. These factors typically lead to a lower birth rate and, consequently, a slower rate of population growth.\n\n**B: The birth rate is lower than the death rate.**\nThis situation would cause a natural decrease in the population. If the number of deaths exceeds the number of births, the population will shrink, assuming migration is not a factor. This is the opposite of high population growth. For population growth to occur, the birth rate must be higher than the death rate, and/or net migration must be positive and significant enough to offset any natural decrease.\n\n**C: The retirement age has increased.**\nAn increase in the retirement age affects the size of the labour force and the dependency ratio, but it does not directly cause the total population to grow. The retirement age determines when individuals are eligible to stop working and receive a pension. It does not alter the number of births, deaths, or migrants, which are the fundamental components of population change."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_56.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 what is the most likely cause of an increase in poverty in developing economies?\na _anincrease in poor nutrition and ill-health\nb_anincrease in education provision\nc_anincrease in international tourism\nd_anincrease in trade union bargaining power", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nPoor nutrition and ill-health are significant causes of poverty and can create a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. When individuals suffer from poor nutrition, their physical and cognitive abilities are impaired, reducing their productivity at work or their ability to work at all. This leads to lower incomes. Similarly, ill-health results in lost workdays and can lead to high medical expenses, depleting household savings and pushing families further into poverty. This cycle, often called the poverty trap, means that poverty leads to poor health, and poor health, in turn, perpetuates poverty.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. an increase in education provision**\nAn increase in the provision of education is a primary method for *reducing* poverty, not causing it. Education enhances human capital, equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge needed for higher-paying jobs. A more educated workforce is more productive, which attracts investment and leads to economic growth. This, in turn, creates more employment opportunities and raises average incomes, helping to lift people out of poverty.\n\n**C. an increase in international tourism**\nAn increase in international tourism typically leads to a *decrease* in poverty in developing economies. The tourism sector is labour-intensive, creating jobs in hotels, transportation, restaurants, and as tour guides. This provides income for local people. Furthermore, tourism brings in valuable foreign currency, which can boost the country's foreign exchange reserves and contribute to overall economic development, further reducing poverty rates.\n\n**D. an increase in trade union bargaining power**\nAn increase in the bargaining power of trade unions generally aims to *reduce* poverty for workers. Trade unions negotiate on behalf of their members for higher wages, improved working conditions, and better benefits. If successful, these negotiations increase the disposable income of workers, improving their standard of living and moving them away from the poverty line. While some economic theories suggest that excessively high union-negotiated wages could lead to unemployment, the direct and intended effect of increased union power is the alleviation of poverty for its members."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_57.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 two countries wish to use their scarce resources to specialise in production and trade with each\nother.\nunder which conditions is this most likely to happen?\nthe ability of each\nthe resource\n: country to\nallocations of the \u2018\n\u00e9 reallocate their\ntwo countries\nresources\na different difficult\nb different easy\ncc similar difficult\nd similar easy", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nSpecialisation and trade are most likely to occur when countries have different resource allocations and can easily reallocate those resources. Different resource endowments (e.g., one country has abundant fertile land, another has a highly skilled workforce) lead to different production efficiencies and, crucially, different opportunity costs. This difference in opportunity costs is the basis for comparative advantage, which provides the fundamental incentive for countries to specialise in producing certain goods and then trade with each other. For this specialisation to be realised, a country must be able to shift its factors of production (labour, capital) from contracting industries to expanding ones. If this reallocation is easy (i.e., factors of production are mobile), the country can efficiently adapt its production structure to exploit its comparative advantage. Therefore, the combination of an incentive to specialise (different resources) and the ability to do so (easy reallocation) creates the ideal conditions for trade.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: different resource allocations, difficult reallocation**\nWhile different resource allocations create the potential gains from trade based on comparative advantage, the inability to easily reallocate resources acts as a significant barrier. If it is difficult for a country to move labour and capital from one industry to another (low factor mobility), attempting to specialise would lead to structural unemployment and underutilised capital. The costs and social disruption associated with this difficult transition would likely outweigh the potential benefits of trade, making specialisation unlikely to happen.\n\n**C: similar resource allocations, difficult reallocation**\nThis scenario presents the least likely conditions for specialisation and trade. If two countries have similar resource endowments, they will likely have similar opportunity costs in production. This removes the primary basis for trade according to the principle of comparative advantage, meaning there is little economic incentive to specialise. Compounding this, the difficulty in reallocating resources creates a practical barrier, making specialisation both undesirable and impractical.\n\n**D: similar resource allocations, easy reallocation**\nIf two countries have similar resource allocations, there is no strong reason based on comparative advantage for them to specialise and trade. They would be similarly efficient at producing the same range of goods. Although the ability to easily reallocate resources means that specialisation would be technically feasible without major economic friction, the fundamental economic incentive to do so is absent. Trade might still occur for other reasons (e.g., to access greater product variety or achieve economies of scale), but specialisation driven by resource differences is improbable."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_58.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 what is a likely effect of imposing a tariff?\na it encourages home industries to be more efficient.\nb_ it increases the demand for home-produced goods.\nc it reduces the price of home-produced goods.\nd_ it reduces the price of imports.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods. The primary effect of a tariff is to raise the price of these imported goods in the domestic market. As imports become more expensive, consumers and businesses will seek out less expensive alternatives. Home-produced (domestic) goods, which are not subject to the tariff, become relatively cheaper in comparison. This change in relative prices causes a shift in demand away from the more expensive imported goods and towards the cheaper domestic substitutes. Consequently, the demand for home-produced goods increases.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. It encourages home industries to be more efficient.**\nThis is incorrect. A tariff is a protectionist measure that shields domestic industries from foreign competition. By making competing imports more expensive, it reduces the competitive pressure on home industries to lower their costs and improve their efficiency. In fact, protectionism can lead to complacency and a lack of innovation, potentially making domestic industries less efficient over time as they are not forced to compete on a level playing field with more efficient foreign producers.\n\n**C. It reduces the price of home-produced goods.**\nThis is incorrect. As explained above, a tariff increases the demand for home-produced goods because they become relatively cheaper than imports. According to the laws of supply and demand, an increase in demand, ceteris paribus (all other things being equal), will lead to an increase in the price of those goods, not a decrease. Domestic producers may raise their prices in response to both the higher demand and the reduced competition from foreign firms.\n\n**D. It reduces the price of imports.**\nThis is incorrect.

Because it is impossible to produce everything that everyone desires, societies must make choices about how to allocate their limited resources. Therefore, the existence of unlimited wants in a world of limited resources is the root cause of scarcity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. high employment levels**\nHigh employment levels signify that an economy is efficiently utilising its labour resources. This leads to greater production of goods and services, which helps to alleviate the problem of scarcity by satisfying more wants. High employment is a sign of an economy operating closer to its full potential, but it does not cause scarcity. Scarcity would still exist even with full employment because wants are unlimited, while resources, even when fully employed, are still finite.\n\n**B. high investment levels**\nInvestment involves using resources to create capital goods (e.g., machinery, factories) that increase an economy's productive capacity. High investment levels enable an economy to produce more goods and services in the future, thereby reducing the impact of scarcity over time. Consequently, high investment is a means of addressing scarcity, not a cause of it.\n\n**C. unlimited resources**\nScarcity is defined by the limitation of resources relative to wants. If resources were unlimited, it would be possible to produce an infinite amount of goods and services, satisfying every want. In such a situation, the problem of scarcity would not exist.

A decrease in government regulation on firms, often called deregulation, makes it easier and less costly for entrepreneurs to start and run businesses. Reduced regulation lowers administrative burdens (or \"red tape\"), reduces compliance costs, and may open up new markets or opportunities for innovation. This creates a more favourable environment for risk-taking and business creation, thereby encouraging more individuals to become entrepreneurs and increasing the supply of enterprise in the economy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** A decrease in government spending on education would most likely hinder the development of enterprise in the long term. Education improves the quality of labour (human capital), fostering skills, knowledge, and creativity. A well-educated population is more likely to produce innovators and skilled entrepreneurs. Therefore, reducing investment in education would likely lead to a less skilled workforce and a smaller pool of potential entrepreneurs, ultimately decreasing the supply of enterprise.\n\n**C:** An increase in emigration means that more people are leaving the country to live and work abroad. This reduces the size of the domestic labour force. Among those who emigrate may be potential or existing entrepreneurs. The loss of these individuals, often referred to as a \"brain drain,\" directly reduces the amount of entrepreneurial talent available within the economy, thus decreasing the factor of enterprise.\n\n**D:** An increase in taxation on firms (e.g., corporation tax) reduces the potential profitability of business ventures. Profit is the primary reward and incentive for entrepreneurs who risk their own capital. When taxes on profits increase, the net reward for successful risk-taking decreases.

Because it affects the disposable income of all taxpayers and has widespread implications for the national economy, it is classified as a macroeconomic issue.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. households spend less on holidays abroad**\nThis statement describes the behaviour of individual economic units (households) in a specific market (international travel). The study of individual decision-making by households and firms is the focus of microeconomics. While the aggregate of all such spending decisions would contribute to macroeconomic indicators like the balance of payments, the activity itself, a change in consumer preference or spending on a particular service, is a microeconomic topic.\n\n**C. wages rise for construction workers**\nThis refers to a price change (wages) in a specific factor market (the market for construction labour). Microeconomics analyses the determination of prices and wages in individual markets. A wage rise for a particular group of workers is due to the specific supply and demand conditions within that industry, rather than a change in the general wage level across the entire economy, which would be a macroeconomic concern.\n\n**D. world coffee price rises due to poor weather**\nThis statement relates to the determination of price in a single commodity market (coffee). The study of how supply and demand interact to determine the price and quantity of a specific good or service is a central theme of microeconomics. Poor weather affects the supply of coffee, leading to a price change within that particular market.

The correct formula to calculate it is:\n\n**PES = Percentage Change in Quantity Supplied / Percentage Change in Price**\n\nThis formula accurately reflects the definition of PES. It sets up a ratio that shows how much the quantity that producers are willing to sell changes for every 1% change in the market price. Using percentage changes for both the numerator (quantity supplied) and the denominator (price) is crucial because it makes the resulting elasticity value a unit-free number. This allows for meaningful comparisons of supply responsiveness across different products, irrespective of their price levels or the units used to measure quantity.\n\n---\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. the percentage change in price divided by the change in quantity supplied**\n\nThis formula is incorrect because it divides a percentage change by an absolute (or raw) change. Elasticity formulas must compare a percentage change with another percentage change to provide a standardised, unit-free measure. Furthermore, the formula is inverted; it incorrectly places price in the numerator and quantity in the denominator, which does not measure the responsiveness of supply to price.\n\n**B. the percentage change in price divided by the percentage change in quantity supplied**\n\nThis formula is incorrect because it is the inverse of the correct formula for price elasticity of supply. While it correctly uses percentage changes for both variables, it measures the responsiveness of price to a change in quantity supplied. The correct definition of price elasticity of supply requires measuring the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price, meaning the percentage change in quantity supplied must be in the numerator.\n\n**C. the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the change in price**\n\nThis formula is incorrect because it compares a percentage change in the numerator with an absolute (or raw) change in the denominator. A valid elasticity calculation requires both variables to be expressed in percentage terms. This standardisation is necessary to create a unit-free coefficient that can be compared across different markets and goods.

This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. A key determinant of PED is the availability of substitutes. If a product has a close substitute, consumers can easily switch to the alternative product if the price of the original product increases. This high degree of substitutability makes consumers very responsive to price changes, resulting in a large decrease in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, the presence of close substitutes is the most likely cause of price elastic demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. The product is a habit-forming good.**\nHabit-forming goods, such as cigarettes or coffee, tend to have **price inelastic demand** (PED less than one). Consumers who are accustomed to purchasing these goods are often less sensitive to price changes and will continue to buy them even if the price rises. The strength of the habit reduces the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price.\n\n**C. The product is a necessity.**\nNecessities are goods essential for daily life, such as basic food, water, or electricity. By definition, consumers cannot easily go without them. Consequently, if the price of a necessity increases, the quantity demanded will fall by a smaller proportion, as people still need to purchase it. This results in **price inelastic demand** (PED less than one).\n\n**D. The product requires only a small proportion of consumer income.**\nWhen a product accounts for a very small fraction of a consumer's total income (e.g., a box of salt), a change in its price has a negligible impact on the consumer's overall budget. As a result, consumers are not very responsive to price changes for such goods. They are unlikely to significantly alter their consumption, leading to **price inelastic demand** (PED less than one)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_68.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "8 for some illnesses, wearing a face mask has a benefit as it could prevent people from getting\ninfected. not all people are willing to wear face masks.\nbased on the statement above, why would there be an inefficient allocation of face masks in the\nfree market?\na consumers in the free market only consider private costs and benefits.\nb face masks are non-rival and non-excludable.\nc_ there is abuse of monopoly power by the producer of face masks.\nd_ there is perfect information in the free market.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nWearing a face mask generates a **positive externality of consumption**. This occurs when the consumption of a good or service provides benefits to third parties who are not directly involved in the market transaction.\n\nIn this case, the **private benefit** is the protection the mask offers to the individual wearer. However, there is also a significant **external benefit** (or social benefit): when an individual wears a mask, they reduce the likelihood of transmitting an illness to others in the community.\n\nIn a free market, consumers are assumed to be rational and will typically only consider their own private costs (the price of the mask, discomfort) and private benefits (personal protection). They do not factor in the external benefits their actions provide to society. Because the social benefit (private benefit + external benefit) is greater than the private benefit, the demand for face masks in the free market will be lower than the socially optimal level. This leads to under-consumption and under-production, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources, also known as market failure.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) Face masks are non-rival and non-excludable.**\nThis describes the characteristics of a **public good**. However, face masks are **private goods**.\n*   **Rivalrous:** A face mask is rival because if one person uses a specific mask, no one else can use that same mask.\n*   **Excludable:** A face mask is excludable because a seller can easily prevent someone from having a mask if they do not pay for it.\nSince face masks are both rival and excludable, they are not public goods, and this statement is incorrect.\n\n**C) There is abuse of monopoly power by the producer of face masks.**\nAbuse of monopoly power can indeed lead to an inefficient allocation of resources by restricting output and charging higher prices. However, the information provided in the statement focuses on the consumption side of the market\u2014the benefits of wearing a mask and the unwillingness of some people to do so.

It is not a cause of inefficiency. Market failure often occurs due to *imperfect* information, where consumers or producers lack the information to make optimal decisions.

An increase in consumers' incomes will typically lead to an increase in the demand for a normal good like rice. This is represented by a rightward shift of the demand curve. With a fixed supply curve, this increase in demand creates a shortage at the original price, pushing the equilibrium price upwards. As the price of rice rises, producers are incentivised to increase the quantity of rice they are willing and able to sell, resulting in a movement upwards along the existing supply curve to a new, higher quantity supplied.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. a decrease in the productivity of farmworkers:** A decrease in productivity means that more resources (labour, time) are needed to produce the same amount of rice, effectively increasing the cost of production per unit. This change in the conditions of supply would cause the entire supply curve to shift to the left, indicating a decrease in the quantity supplied at every price level. This is a shift of the curve, not a movement along it.\n\n**B. a decrease in the profitability of rice production:** A decrease in profitability could result from either a fall in the price of rice or an increase in production costs. A fall in the price of rice would cause a downward movement along the supply curve (a contraction of supply). An increase in production costs would cause the entire supply curve to shift to the left. Neither of these outcomes is an upward movement along the supply curve.\n\n**D. an increase in farmworkers' wages:** An increase in wages is an increase in the cost of production for rice farmers. This makes it less profitable to produce rice at any given price. Consequently, producers will supply less rice at each price level, causing the entire supply curve to shift to the left (a decrease in supply).

This means that the purchasing power of money, or cash, decreases rapidly. For an asset to be considered a good \"store of value,\" it must be able to retain its value over time. Cash fails to do this during inflation because a fixed amount of money will buy progressively fewer goods and services. Therefore, cash is the asset that is least likely to act as an effective store of value.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) gold**\nGold is a physical commodity with a finite supply. Historically, it has been considered a \"safe-haven\" asset during times of economic uncertainty and inflation. As the value of currency decreases due to inflation, the price of gold, priced in that currency, tends to rise. Investors often buy gold to protect their wealth from being eroded by inflation, making it a relatively effective store of value.\n\n**C) property**\nProperty, such as land and buildings, is a real, tangible asset. The value of real assets tends to increase during periods of inflation, often at a rate similar to or greater than the rate of inflation. This helps property to maintain its real value. For this reason, real estate is often considered a strong hedge against inflation and a good store of value.\n\n**D) shares**\nShares, or equities, represent ownership in a company. Companies own real assets and can often pass on increased costs to consumers by raising the prices of their goods and services. This can lead to increased nominal revenues and profits, which in turn can drive up the value of the company's shares.

Firstly, the interest rate represents the return on savings. When the rate rises from 1% to 4%, it becomes more rewarding for individuals to save their money in financial institutions like banks. The higher return acts as an incentive for individuals to postpone current consumption in favour of saving more for the future. Consequently, the amount saved is expected to increase.\n\nSecondly, the interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. When individuals or firms take out loans (e.g., mortgages, car loans, or business loans), the interest rate determines how much they must pay back in addition to the principal amount. An increase in the central bank's rate typically leads to commercial banks increasing their lending rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, thus increasing the cost of borrowing for individuals.\n\nTherefore, a rise in the interest rate leads to an increase in the amount saved and an increase in the cost of borrowing.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decreased, decreased**\nThis option is incorrect on both accounts. A higher interest rate increases the reward for saving, which incentivises individuals to save more, not less.

The ability to withdraw labour through a strike is the most powerful tool a union possesses during wage negotiations. A strike, or the threat of a strike, imposes significant costs on an employer, such as lost production, reduced revenue, and potential loss of market share. If laws make it more difficult to legally organise a strike (e.g., by requiring complex balloting procedures, mandatory 'cooling-off' periods, or banning strikes in certain sectors), the union's primary source of leverage is diminished. This reduces the employer's incentive to concede to wage demands, thereby decreasing the union's bargaining strength.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a rapidly growing economy**\n\nA rapidly growing economy significantly strengthens a trade union's bargaining position. During an economic boom, firms typically experience rising demand and higher profits. They are more willing and able to afford wage increases. Furthermore, the demand for labour is high, making it difficult for firms to replace workers. The opportunity cost to the employer of a strike (in terms of lost profits from unmet demand) is much higher during a period of growth. Consequently, employers are more likely to agree to a union's wage demands to avoid disruptive industrial action and maintain production.\n\n**B. high union membership in the industry**\n\nHigh union membership, often referred to as high union density, is a fundamental source of a trade union's bargaining strength. When a large proportion of workers in an industry or firm are union members, it creates a powerful collective voice. A call for a strike is more effective as it can halt or severely disrupt the employer's operations. It also makes it difficult for the employer to continue production using non-union workers. This credible threat of collective action forces the employer to take the union's demands, including those for higher wages, more seriously.\n\n**D. workers are in short supply**\n\nWhen workers are in short supply, their market power increases, which in turn strengthens a trade union's bargaining position. A shortage of labour means that employers are competing to attract and retain staff. It is difficult and costly for firms to find replacement workers if current employees leave or go on strike. A trade union can leverage this scarcity to negotiate for higher wages, as employers are more likely to concede to demands to avoid losing their essential workforce and facing the high costs of recruitment and training in a tight labour market."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_74.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "14 which conditions are most likely to attract small firms to enter a market?\nthe market for fixed uni of\nentering the\nthe product \u2018\nindustry\n\na local high\n\nb local low\n\ncc national high\n\nd national low", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nSmall firms typically have limited access to capital and operate on a smaller scale than large corporations.

Small firms often lack the substantial capital needed to cover high start-up expenses, such as purchasing expensive machinery or paying for costly licenses. This financial hurdle would likely deter or prevent a small firm from entering the market, despite its local nature.\n\n**C: national, high**\nThis combination represents the most significant barriers to entry for a small firm. A national market demands a large scale of production, a complex distribution and logistics network, and extensive marketing to build brand recognition across the country, all of which are beyond the typical capacity of a small firm. Coupled with high fixed costs, the financial requirements would be prohibitive, making it extremely unlikely for a small firm to enter such a market.\n\n**D: national, low**\nAlthough low fixed costs make market entry more financially accessible, operating at a national level presents substantial challenges for a small firm.

This provides a clear benchmark for policy and helps to anchor public expectations about future price changes, contributing to economic stability.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a minimum of 10 years of schooling**\n\nThis is an example of an educational or social policy, not a direct macroeconomic aim. While a well-educated workforce (improved human capital) is crucial for achieving the macroeconomic aim of long-term economic growth, the policy of mandating a minimum number of school years is a specific government intervention or instrument used to achieve that broader goal. Core macroeconomic aims focus on aggregate economic variables like GDP, inflation, and unemployment.\n\n**B: a sales tax of 10% on consumer goods**\n\nThis is an example of a **policy instrument**, not a policy aim. A sales tax is a tool of fiscal policy that a government can use to achieve its aims. For example, a government might implement a sales tax to raise revenue to fund public services, to discourage consumption and thereby reduce aggregate demand to combat inflation, or to alter the pattern of consumption. The tax itself is the means, while the objective it is designed to achieve (e.g., funding services or controlling inflation) is the aim.\n\n**D: increasing pay for nurses**\n\nThis is a microeconomic policy decision that affects a specific market\u2014the labour market for nurses. Macroeconomic aims are concerned with the entire economy, such as the overall level of employment or the average wage level across all sectors. A decision about the pay for a single profession, while important, is a microeconomic issue and does not represent a broad objective for the national economy."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_78.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "18 government policy measures can affect economic activity in a country.\nwhich pair of monetary policy measures would be likely to increase employment?\na_ depreciate foreign exchange rates and increase education spending\nb_ increase money supply and reduce interest rates\nc provide subsidies and grants and lower sales tax\nd_ reduce income tax and improve infrastructure", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option correctly identifies two key tools of expansionary monetary policy. Monetary policy is conducted by a country's central bank and primarily involves managing interest rates and the money supply to achieve macroeconomic goals.\n\n*   **Increase money supply:** When the central bank increases the amount of money circulating in the economy (e.g., through quantitative easing or open market operations), commercial banks have more funds available to lend.\n*   **Reduce interest rates:** Lowering the official interest rate makes it cheaper for commercial banks to borrow from the central bank, a cost saving they typically pass on to consumers and businesses in the form of lower loan rates.\n\nTogether, these measures stimulate aggregate demand. Cheaper and more accessible credit encourages firms to invest in new projects and expansion, and encourages consumers to spend on goods and services. This increase in total spending in the economy leads firms to increase production, which in turn requires them to hire more workers, thereby increasing employment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: depreciate foreign exchange rates and increase education spending**\nThis option is incorrect because it mixes exchange rate policy with fiscal policy. \"Increase education spending\" is a fiscal policy tool, as it involves a direct change in government expenditure. While monetary policy (like lowering interest rates) can lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, which can boost employment by making exports more competitive, this option is not a pair of purely monetary policy measures.\n\n**C: provide subsidies and grants and lower sales tax**\nThis option is incorrect because both measures described are examples of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. \"Providing subsidies and grants\" is a form of government spending, and \"lowering sales tax\" is a change in tax policy. While these expansionary fiscal policies can increase employment, they are not monetary policies.\n\n**D: reduce income tax and improve infrastructure**\nThis option is incorrect because, like option C, it describes two fiscal policy measures. \"Reducing income tax\" is a change in taxation designed to increase disposable income and consumption. \"Improving infrastructure\" is a form of government spending.

The interest rate represents the return a saver receives for depositing money in a financial institution. When interest rates are higher, individuals earn more money on their savings over time. This makes saving more attractive relative to spending. Furthermore, a higher interest rate increases the opportunity cost of current consumption; by choosing to spend money now, an individual forgoes a larger potential future return. This provides a strong incentive for households and individuals to postpone consumption and increase their level of saving.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a rise in the exchange rate**\nA rise in the exchange rate means the domestic currency has appreciated in value relative to foreign currencies. This makes imported goods and services cheaper for domestic consumers. Cheaper imports may encourage consumers to increase their spending on these goods, which would represent an increase in consumption, not saving. The effect on saving is indirect and not necessarily positive; therefore, it is not the most likely factor to encourage saving.\n\n**B: a rise in the goods and services tax rate**\nA rise in the goods and services tax (GST) or value-added tax (VAT) increases the prices of most goods and services that consumers buy. While this makes current consumption more expensive, which might deter some spending, it also reduces the real disposable income of consumers. With less purchasing power, households may have a reduced capacity to save, especially if they need to spend a larger proportion of their income on essential items. The overall effect on saving is ambiguous and less direct than a change in the interest rate.\n\n**C: a rise in the income tax rate**\nA rise in the income tax rate reduces the disposable income of individuals and households. Disposable income is the amount of money left for spending and saving after income taxes have been paid. With a lower disposable income, individuals have less money available for both consumption and saving. In most cases, a reduction in disposable income will lead to a decrease in the absolute amount of money saved, as households prioritise necessary consumption.

As the economy is already operating at full employment, its resources are fully utilised, and the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is steep (inelastic). The rightward shift in the AD curve, with little to no corresponding increase in output, will lead to significant upward pressure on the general price level. This is known as demand-pull inflation. Therefore, achieving low inflation becomes **less likely** in the short run.\n\n*   **Long Run:** Government spending on education and training is a supply-side policy. Over time, it improves the skills, productivity, and flexibility of the labour force. This enhances the economy's productive capacity, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. An increase in the economy's potential output means that more goods and services can be produced, which helps to absorb rising aggregate demand without causing inflation. This makes achieving low inflation **more likely** in the long run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: less likely / less likely**\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the long-run effect. While the short-run effect is inflationary, the long-run investment in human capital (education and training) increases the economy's productive potential, which is a key factor in maintaining low inflation over time.\n\n**C: more likely / less likely**\nThis option incorrectly assesses both the short-run and long-run effects. In the short run, the increase in aggregate demand at full employment is inflationary, making low inflation less, not more, likely. In the long run, the supply-side benefits reduce inflationary pressures, making low inflation more, not less, likely.\n\n**D: more likely / more likely**\nThis option is incorrect because it overlooks the immediate short-run impact. The demand-side effect of increased government spending occurs immediately, causing demand-pull inflation when the economy is at full capacity.

The initial burden of an indirect tax falls on the producer, who then attempts to pass it on to the consumer through higher prices. The scenario describes a tax on a good that producers have passed on, which is characteristic of an indirect tax.\n\nThe incidence of an indirect tax, or who bears the final burden, depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED) and price elasticity of supply (PES). When demand for a good is price inelastic, it means that consumers' quantity demanded is not very responsive to a change in price. This is typical for necessities, as consumers need the product and will continue to purchase it even at a higher price. Consequently, producers can pass on a large proportion of the tax to consumers without a significant drop in sales. The statement \"producers have passed on a large proportion of this tax\" confirms that demand must be price inelastic.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: direct, price elastic**\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the tax described is an indirect tax, not a direct tax. A direct tax is levied on income or wealth and its burden cannot be shifted to consumers in the form of a higher price for a specific product. Secondly, if demand were price elastic, consumers would be highly responsive to a price increase. Producers would be unable to pass on a large proportion of the tax because doing so would cause a significant fall in the quantity demanded and a loss of revenue.\n\n**B: direct, price inelastic**\nThis is incorrect because the tax described is an indirect tax on a good, not a direct tax on income or wealth. While the price elasticity of demand is correctly identified as inelastic (given that it's a necessity and the tax burden is passed on), the type of tax is wrong.\n\n**C: indirect, price elastic**\nThis is incorrect because although the type of tax is correctly identified as indirect, the price elasticity of demand is wrong. If demand were price elastic, consumers would be very sensitive to price changes. A producer attempting to pass on a large proportion of the tax through a higher price would face a proportionally larger decrease in quantity demanded.

This shift creates a mismatch between the skills of the available workforce and the skills required for new jobs. A country moving from producing primary sector goods (e.g., agriculture, mining) to secondary sector goods (e.g., manufacturing, construction) is a classic example of such a structural change. Workers who were employed in the primary sector, such as farmers or miners, may find their skills are no longer in demand. The new jobs in the secondary sector require different skills, such as operating machinery or working on an assembly line. This skills gap means that even though new jobs are being created, the displaced workers from the primary sector cannot easily fill them, leading to an increase in structural unemployment.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. The country is experiencing a period of negative economic growth.**\nThis scenario describes a recession or economic downturn. The type of unemployment that rises during a recession is known as cyclical unemployment (or demand-deficient unemployment). It occurs because a fall in aggregate demand leads to a general decline in the demand for labour across the economy, rather than a mismatch of skills specific to certain industries. While a prolonged recession can sometimes expose or worsen structural issues, its primary and most direct impact is on cyclical unemployment.\n\n**B. The country is experiencing a period of positive economic growth.**\nPositive economic growth typically leads to an increase in aggregate demand and, consequently, an increase in the demand for labour. This tends to reduce overall unemployment levels, particularly cyclical unemployment. While rapid growth could be associated with structural changes, the growth itself is not the direct cause of structural unemployment; rather, it is a condition that generally improves employment prospects.\n\n**D. The country is moving towards more flexible labour markets.**\nMore flexible labour markets are characterised by reduced regulations, making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers and for wages to adjust to supply and demand. Such flexibility is generally considered a policy to *reduce* unemployment, including structural unemployment. By allowing wages to fall in declining industries and rise in growing ones, and by making it easier for new firms to hire, labour market flexibility can help the workforce adapt more quickly to structural economic changes, thereby shortening the duration of unemployment.

Citizens who have borrowed money at a fixed rate of interest benefit from this situation. Their debt is a fixed nominal amount, but the real value of that debt decreases as inflation rises. They repay their loan in the future with money that is worth less than the money they originally borrowed. If their wages rise with inflation, the fixed loan repayments become a smaller proportion of their income, making the debt easier to service.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. citizens who are receiving fixed state benefits**\nThese individuals are harmed by inflation. Their income is a fixed nominal amount (e.g., a set pension or unemployment benefit). As inflation causes the price of goods and services to rise, the purchasing power of their fixed benefit decreases. They can afford to buy less with the same amount of money, leading to a decline in their real income and standard of living.\n\n**B. citizens who earn fixed incomes**\nSimilar to those on fixed benefits, individuals earning fixed incomes (e.g., those on a fixed salary with no annual cost-of-living adjustment) are negatively affected by inflation. The nominal value of their income remains the same, but its real value is eroded by rising prices. Their salary buys progressively fewer goods and services, reducing their purchasing power.\n\n**C. citizens who have lent money at a fixed rate of interest**\nLenders are harmed by unexpected or rapid inflation. They provide a loan and receive repayments (principal and interest) at a fixed rate. When inflation is high, the money they are paid back has less purchasing power than the money they originally lent. The real rate of return on their loan decreases.

Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), on the other hand, is a measure of the total economic output of a country, adjusted for inflation.

Real GDP is calculated using the expenditure approach: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where X represents exports and M represents imports.

Real GDP is the most widely used measure of a country's economic output.

Neither the HDI nor real GDP uses the unemployment rate as a direct component in its calculation. The HDI is composed of life expectancy, education years, and GNI per capita.

An increase in subsistence farming, where production is for personal consumption rather than for the market, is a feature of a less developed economy. As a country develops, agriculture becomes more commercialised and efficient, leading to a *decrease* in subsistence farming. Simultaneously, the financial services sector, which is a key component of the tertiary sector, is crucial for mobilising savings, facilitating investment, and enabling trade. Therefore, a developing economy would be expected to experience significant *growth* in its financial services sector, not a decrease. The combination of an increase in subsistence farming and a decrease in financial services represents economic regression, which is the opposite of development.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** An increase in average incomes and a decrease in unemployment are primary goals and indicators of successful economic development. As an economy grows and diversifies, it creates more job opportunities, reducing unemployment. This increased demand for labour, coupled with rising productivity, leads to higher wages and, consequently, an increase in average incomes and living standards. This is a very likely outcome of development.\n\n**B:** Industrialisation is a common stage in economic development, characterised by a significant increase in manufacturing production (the secondary sector). As manufacturing output grows, so does the need for associated services to support production and trade. Shipping services are a vital part of the tertiary sector, essential for transporting raw materials to factories and finished goods to domestic and international markets. Therefore, an increase in both manufacturing and shipping is a typical and logical feature of a developing economy.\n\n**D:** Many developing countries possess natural beauty, unique cultures, or a comparative advantage in certain agricultural products. An increase in tourism (a service industry) can be a major source of foreign exchange earnings and employment. Similarly, modernising the agricultural sector to increase output for export can also generate significant revenue. Both strategies are commonly pursued by countries to foster economic development.

Embargoes are often implemented for political reasons, but also for health and safety concerns, such as preventing the spread of agricultural diseases.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Cereals become less popular with the population of developing economies.**\nThis scenario describes a decrease in domestic demand for cereals within the exporting countries (developing economies). If the local population consumes fewer cereals, a larger surplus becomes available for export. This increase in the supply of cereals to the international market, assuming demand in developed countries remains unchanged, would likely lead to an *increase* in the volume of international trade, as more can be sold abroad, potentially at a lower price.\n\n**C. Governments tax cereal production in developed economies.**\nThe premise is that developed economies import cereals because domestic production is more expensive. A tax on domestic cereal production in these developed economies would further increase the cost of producing cereals at home. This would widen the price gap between domestically produced and imported cereals, making imports from developing economies even more attractive. As a result, demand for imported cereals would likely increase, leading to a rise in international trade, not a reduction.\n\n**D. Producers of cereals in developing economies are subsidised.**\nA subsidy is a financial grant from a government to producers to lower their production costs. If governments in developing economies subsidise their cereal producers, those producers can supply cereals to the world market at a lower price.

The imposition of a quota on imported cars reduces foreign competition. This leads to a higher price for cars in the domestic market.

To reduce this deficit, a country needs to either increase its exports or decrease its imports.\n\nIncreasing spending on infrastructure, such as transport and communication networks, is a supply-side policy. Improved infrastructure can lower production and distribution costs for domestic firms, leading to an increase in efficiency and productivity. When domestic firms become more productive, they can offer their goods and services at more competitive prices. This makes their products more attractive to foreign buyers, leading to an increase in export revenue. Simultaneously, more competitively priced domestic goods will be more attractive to local consumers, who may choose them over imported alternatives, thus reducing import expenditure. The combination of rising exports and falling imports will reduce the current account deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: decrease the level of subsidies to domestic producers**\nSubsidies are government payments to firms that reduce their costs of production. Decreasing these subsidies would raise production costs for domestic producers. This would likely lead to higher prices for their goods, making them less competitive in both international and domestic markets. As a result, exports would likely fall, and imports would likely rise, which would worsen the current account deficit, not reduce it.\n\n**C: increase interest rates**\nIncreasing interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that has conflicting effects on the current account. On one hand, higher interest rates discourage borrowing and spending by consumers and firms, reducing overall demand in the economy. This fall in demand would include a reduction in spending on imported goods, which helps to reduce the deficit. On the other hand, higher interest rates attract foreign financial investment, increasing the demand for the domestic currency and causing its exchange rate to appreciate (strengthen). A stronger currency makes exports more expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for domestic consumers, which tends to worsen the current account deficit. Because of these contradictory effects, it is not the most likely policy to successfully reduce the deficit.\n\n**D: remove import tariffs**\nImport tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods to make them more expensive and less attractive to domestic consumers. Removing import tariffs would have the opposite effect: it would make imported goods cheaper and more accessible. This would likely lead to an increase in the quantity and value of imports, thereby increasing the current account deficit rather than reducing it."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_91.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "1. what is part of the economic definition of scarcity?\na high levels of taxation\nb low levels of investment\nc unequal distribution of income\nd unlimited consumer wants", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe fundamental economic problem is scarcity, which is defined as the situation where there are limited resources available to satisfy unlimited human wants. \"Unlimited consumer wants\" is a core component of this definition. It refers to the idea that human desires for goods and services are endless; as soon as one want is fulfilled, another takes its place. Because resources (such as land, labour, and capital) are finite, it is impossible to produce everything that everyone wants. This forces individuals, firms, and governments to make choices about how to allocate these scarce resources, which is the central focus of economics.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. high levels of taxation:**\nHigh levels of taxation are a feature of fiscal policy, not a component of the definition of scarcity. Taxation is a tool used by governments to raise revenue and manage the economy. While it can affect the disposable income of consumers and the resources available to firms, thereby influencing how scarcity is experienced, it does not define the underlying problem. Scarcity exists in all economies, regardless of the level of taxation.\n\n**B. low levels of investment:**\nInvestment is the expenditure on capital goods to increase future production. Low levels of investment can constrain an economy's ability to produce goods and services, potentially worsening the effects of scarcity over time. However, it is a consequence or a related economic issue, not part of the fundamental definition of scarcity. The problem of scarcity\u2014limited resources versus unlimited wants\u2014persists even in economies with high levels of investment.\n\n**C. unequal distribution of income:**\nThe distribution of income relates to how an economy's total output is shared among its population. An unequal distribution means some individuals can satisfy more of their wants than others. This is an issue of equity and is one of the key economic questions that arises *because* of scarcity (the \"for whom to produce?\" question).

This growth is caused by an increase in the quantity or an improvement in the quality of the factors of production (land, labour, capital, enterprise), or by technological advancements.\n\n*   **Better Education:** An improvement in education increases the quality of the labour force, known as human capital. A more skilled, knowledgeable, and productive workforce can produce a greater output of both capital and consumer goods using the same amount of resources. This enhancement in the quality of a factor of production leads to an outward shift of the PPC. Therefore, the statement 'better education' is a true cause.\n\n*   **Higher Investment:** Investment leads to an increase in the capital stock of a country. This means more machinery, factories, technology, and infrastructure become available for production. An increase in the quantity and quality of capital goods enhances the economy's ability to produce all goods and services, thus shifting the PPC outwards. Therefore, the statement 'higher investment' is also a true cause.\n\n*   **Lower Unemployment:** A reduction in unemployment means that the economy is using its existing resources, specifically labour, more fully. This is represented by a movement from a point *inside* the PPC to a point *on* the PPC. It indicates a move towards productive efficiency, not an increase in the economy's maximum potential. The boundary of the PPC itself does not shift.

Both factors, by improving the quality of labour and increasing the quantity of capital respectively, increase an economy's productive potential and shift the PPC outwards. It also incorrectly claims that lower unemployment causes a shift; lower unemployment represents a movement towards the existing PPC, not a shift of the curve itself.\n\n**B:** This option correctly identifies that higher investment shifts the PPC outwards and that lower unemployment does not. However, it incorrectly states that better education would not cause a shift. Improvements in education enhance the skills and productivity of the labour force (human capital), which is a primary driver of economic growth and an outward shift of the PPC.\n\n**C:** This option correctly identifies that better education causes the PPC to shift outwards. However, it incorrectly states that higher investment would not cause a shift and that lower unemployment would. Higher investment directly increases the capital stock, shifting the PPC outwards.

Consumers in area Y are more willing and able than consumers in area Z to buy good X.**\n\nThis statement is the correct conclusion because it accurately describes the concept of **effective demand**, which is what the table illustrates. Effective demand is not just the desire for a good (willingness) but also the purchasing power to acquire it (ability). The \"quantity demanded\" in an economic sense always refers to effective demand. The table shows that at every given price, the quantity of good X demanded in area Y is substantially higher than in area Z. This directly indicates that, as a whole, the market in area Y demonstrates a greater willingness *and* ability to purchase good X compared to the market in area Z.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. Consumers in area Y are richer than consumers in area Z.**\n\nThis is a possible reason for the difference in demand, but it cannot be concluded with certainty from the table alone. While higher average income is a key determinant of demand, other factors also play a crucial role. For instance, area Y might have a much larger population than area Z, or consumers in area Y may have stronger tastes and preferences for good X. The higher demand could be due to more people buying the good, not necessarily richer people buying it. Since the table provides no data on income levels, this statement is an assumption, not a conclusion.\n\n**C. Consumers in area Y want the good more than consumers in area Z.**\n\nThis statement is incomplete. \"Wanting\" a good only refers to consumer preferences or willingness, which is just one component of effective demand. Demand also requires the ability to pay. The higher quantity demanded in area Y could be due to higher incomes (greater ability) rather than stronger preferences (greater want). For example, consumers in both areas might \"want\" the good equally, but more consumers in area Y can afford it. Therefore, concluding that they simply \"want\" it more is an oversimplification that ignores the critical factor of purchasing power.\n\n**D. There are more consumers living in area Y than in area Z.**\n\nSimilar to income, population size is a determinant of market demand, but it is not the only one. A larger population in area Y could explain the higher demand. However, it is equally possible that area Y has a smaller but wealthier population, or a population of the same size with a much stronger preference for the good. The table only provides data on price and quantity demanded; it offers no information about the demographic characteristics of either area.

When the price of a good with relatively inelastic demand is increased, the total revenue will also increase.\n\nRelatively inelastic demand (where the Price Elasticity of Demand coefficient is less than 1) signifies that consumers are not very responsive to price changes. Therefore, a given percentage increase in price will lead to a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity demanded. Because the fall in quantity demanded is proportionally less than the rise in price, the overall effect is an increase in total revenue. For example, if a firm increases its price by 10% and the quantity demanded only falls by 3%, the firm's total revenue will rise.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. perfectly elastic:**\nPerfectly elastic demand (PED = \u221e) means that any increase in price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded to drop to zero. Consumers are infinitely sensitive to price changes. Therefore, if a firm were to increase its price, its total revenue would fall to zero, which is a decrease, not an increase.\n\n**B. relatively elastic:**\nRelatively elastic demand (PED > 1) means that consumers are highly responsive to price changes. A given percentage increase in price will lead to a larger percentage decrease in the quantity demanded. In this case, the negative effect of the fall in quantity sold outweighs the positive effect of the higher price per unit. As a result, increasing the price for a good with elastic demand will cause total revenue to decrease.\n\n**D. unitary elastic:**\nUnitary elastic demand (PED = 1) means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. If the price of a good is increased, the quantity demanded will fall by the exact same proportion. The effect of the higher price is perfectly offset by the effect of the lower quantity sold.

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. A price increase from P\u2081 to P\u2082 raises the total revenue firms receive for any given quantity. This potential for greater profit provides a powerful incentive for firms to increase their output, which is shown by the extension of supply from Q\u2081 to Q\u2082. The supply curve slopes upwards precisely because higher prices are needed to cover the rising marginal costs of producing more and to make that extra production profitable. Therefore, a higher price gives firms the ability to increase their overall profits.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: A higher price gives firms the incentive to reduce total fixed costs.**\nThis is incorrect. Fixed costs are expenses that do not change with the level of output (e.g., rent, insurance). A change in the selling price of coffee does not alter these costs. While all firms have a general incentive to minimise their costs to maximise profit, a higher market price does not specifically create an incentive to reduce *fixed* costs.\n\n**C: A higher price will encourage consumers to buy more coffee increasing total revenue.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes consumer behaviour. According to the law of demand, a higher price for a good will lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded by consumers, not an increase. Consumers are encouraged to buy less, not more, as the product becomes more expensive.\n\n**D: A higher price will encourage less firms to enter the market to supply coffee.**\nThis is the opposite of what is expected to happen. Higher prices and the resulting potential for increased profitability act as a signal to the market. This signal encourages *new* firms to enter the industry to take advantage of the favourable conditions, and it also encourages existing firms to expand production.

The third party is not directly involved in the production or consumption of the good or service. In the context of university education, the primary transaction is between the student (the consumer) and the university (the producer).\n\nAn increase in the number of university graduates leads to a more skilled, innovative, and productive labour force. This increased productivity boosts economic output, leading to higher incomes for individuals and greater profits for firms. As a result, the government collects more tax revenue from both income taxes and corporation taxes. This increased tax revenue is a benefit to society as a whole, as it can be used to fund public goods and services (e.g., healthcare, infrastructure, defence). Since the government and wider society are third parties to the original education transaction, this increase in tax revenue is considered an external benefit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** An increase in revenue for universities from fee-paying students is a **private benefit**, not an external one. The university is a direct participant in the transaction as the provider of the educational service.

A normal good is one for which demand increases as consumer income rises. With higher incomes, consumers have greater purchasing power and are willing and able to buy more of the good at each price level. This causes the demand curve to shift to the right. Assuming the supply of the good remains constant, this increase in demand will create a shortage at the original price, leading to upward pressure on the price until a new, higher equilibrium price is established.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The cost of raw materials falls.**\nA fall in the cost of raw materials reduces the cost of production for firms. This makes producing the good more profitable at any given price. As a result, firms are willing and able to supply more of the good, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. An increase in supply, with demand held constant, leads to a surplus at the original price, which puts downward pressure on the price, causing it to fall, not increase.\n\n**C. The price of a complement rises.**\nComplementary goods are products that are consumed together (e.g., printers and ink cartridges). If the price of a complementary good rises, the total cost of using both goods increases. Consequently, consumers will demand less of the complementary good and also less of the good in question. This causes the demand curve for the original good to shift to the left, resulting in a lower equilibrium price, not an increase.\n\n**D. The price of a substitute falls.**\nSubstitute goods are products that can be used in place of each other (e.g., tea and coffee). If the price of a substitute good falls, consumers will switch their preference towards the now cheaper alternative.

Savers, by definition, hold money with the expectation that it will be valuable when they choose to spend it later. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level, which means that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did previously. When inflation rises to 4.4%, the money that savers have accumulated loses its purchasing power at that rate. This erosion of value directly undermines money's effectiveness as a store of value, causing savers to \"suffer\" because the real value of their savings has decreased.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Means of deferred payments**\nThe function of money as a means of deferred payment allows for debts to be created and paid back in the future. While high inflation does affect deferred payments (for example, it reduces the real value of the money repaid to a lender), the statement specifically refers to \"savers.\" The primary issue for a saver is the diminishing value of their existing pool of money, which is a \"store of value\" problem, rather than a problem related to a future transaction or debt settlement.\n\n**B: Medium of exchange**\nThe function of money as a medium of exchange is its role in facilitating transactions\u2014the buying and selling of goods and services. This function is concerned with the immediate use of money to avoid the inefficiencies of a barter system.

The problem highlighted is the loss of future purchasing power, not a difficulty in using money for current transactions.\n\n**D: Unit of account**\nThe function of money as a unit of account is to provide a common measure of value, allowing the prices of different goods and services to be expressed and compared in a standard way (e.g., in dollars, pounds, or euros). While high inflation can make money a less reliable unit of account because prices are constantly changing, the \"suffering\" of savers described in the statement is not about their inability to compare prices.

This function means that money is accepted as a means to settle debts in the future. It is the basis for all borrowing and lending. While this is a key function of money, it is distinct from its role in comparing the current value of different items.\n\n**B:** This describes the function of money as a **store of value**. This means that money can be saved and held over time, retaining its purchasing power for future use (though this can be eroded by inflation). This function allows individuals to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future, which is different from using money to compare the values of goods and services at a single point in time.\n\n**C:** This describes the primary function of money as a **medium of exchange**. In this role, money is the universally accepted instrument used to facilitate transactions, eliminating the need for a barter system. This function is about the *process* of buying and selling, not about establishing or comparing the *worth* of the items being traded."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_103.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13 which trade union activity will be beneficial for firms?\na balloting for industrial action to prevent redundancies\nb campaigning to raise wages of trade union members\nc instructing workers to strike over a safety dispute\nd providing training which raises productivity of workers", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nProviding training that raises the productivity of workers is a trade union activity that is directly beneficial for firms. Increased worker productivity means that the output per worker increases. This leads to a fall in the average cost of production for the firm, making it more efficient and competitive. Higher productivity can also lead to improvements in the quality of goods and services produced. This can boost the firm's sales, revenue, and ultimately, its profitability. This is an example of a mutually beneficial arrangement where workers gain new skills and the firm improves its performance.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Balloting for industrial action (such as a strike) and preventing redundancies are actions that are generally not beneficial for a firm. Industrial action disrupts production, leading to lost output and revenue. Preventing redundancies, which a firm might see as necessary to cut costs and improve efficiency, forces the firm to retain staff it may no longer need, thereby keeping its labour costs higher than optimal. These actions increase costs and reduce profitability for the firm.\n\n**B:** While higher wages are beneficial for workers, they represent an increase in the costs of production for the firm. All other factors remaining constant, an increase in wage costs will reduce a firm's profit margins. Therefore, a campaign to raise wages is typically seen as being in conflict with a firm's objective of minimising costs and maximising profits.\n\n**C:** A strike is a form of industrial action where workers refuse to work. This leads to a complete halt in production, causing significant financial harm to the firm through lost revenue and potential damage to its reputation and customer relationships. While the underlying safety dispute may need to be resolved for long-term benefit, the act of striking itself is highly detrimental to the firm's immediate interests."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_104.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 what is not a variable cost of production?\na cost of fuel\nb cost of raw materials\nc_ extra pay for working additional hours\nd rent of offices", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nA fixed cost is a business expense that does not change with the level of output produced. Rent for offices or factory space is a classic example of a fixed cost. It is a contractual, periodic payment that a firm must make regardless of whether it produces a high volume of goods, a low volume, or nothing at all. Because this cost remains constant in the short run, irrespective of production levels, it is not a variable cost.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. cost of fuel**\nThis is a variable cost. The amount of fuel a firm uses for machinery, heating, or transport is directly related to its level of production. As output increases, more fuel is typically consumed, leading to a higher total fuel cost. Conversely, if production decreases, fuel consumption and its associated cost will also fall. Since the cost of fuel fluctuates with output, it is classified as a variable cost.\n\n**B. cost of raw materials**\nThis is a variable cost. Raw materials are the basic inputs that are transformed into finished goods. The total cost of raw materials is directly proportional to the number of units produced. For example, a furniture maker will need more wood to produce more chairs. Therefore, as production output rises, the expenditure on raw materials increases, making it a key variable cost.\n\n**C. extra pay for working additional hours**\nThis is a variable cost. Extra pay for additional hours, commonly known as overtime, is a labour cost that is incurred when a firm needs to increase its output beyond what can be produced in standard working time. This cost is not constant; it rises when production is scaled up and falls (or disappears) when production is reduced. Because it varies directly with the level of production activity, it is considered a variable cost."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_105.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 what is a definition of a firm\u2019s revenue?\na money received from sales\nb _ sales volume\nc surplus over costs\nd_ tax payments", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA firm's revenue is the total income generated from the sale of its goods or services related to its main operations. It is often referred to as \"sales\" or \"turnover.\" Revenue is calculated by multiplying the price at which goods or services are sold by the number of units sold (Price \u00d7 Quantity).

Revenue is the total monetary value of those sales, whereas sales volume is a measure of the physical quantity sold.\n\n**C: surplus over costs**\nThe surplus over costs is the definition of profit, not revenue.

This can lead to problems with management, coordination, and communication. With more layers of management and longer chains of command, decision-making can become slower and less effective, leading to inefficiencies that increase the average cost of production. This is a classic example of a managerial diseconomy of scale, which is an internal factor.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a fall in demand for the products produced by the firm**\nA fall in demand is an external market factor that affects a firm's sales and revenue. It is not related to the firm's scale of production or its internal efficiency. Diseconomies of scale are concerned with rising average costs as a firm *increases* its output and grows in size, not with what happens when the market for its products shrinks.\n\n**C: spending more on research and development to create new products**\nSpending on research and development (R&D) is a strategic investment cost, not a diseconomy of scale. While it increases a firm's total costs in the short term, the goal of R&D is to improve products or processes, which can lead to future growth, increased efficiency, and potential economies of scale. It is a deliberate business decision rather than an inefficiency that arises unintentionally from being too large.\n\n**D: the lack of skilled labour in the geographical area where the firm is based**\nA shortage of skilled labour in a particular area is an *external* factor because it is outside the direct control of the firm and typically affects all firms in that industry or region.

A budget deficit occurs when government expenditure is greater than its revenue. To reduce a budget deficit, a government must either decrease its spending or increase its revenue. The policy described involves increasing indirect taxes, which directly increases the government's tax revenue. This increase in revenue, assuming government spending does not increase by a greater amount, will lead to a reduction in the budget deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: to increase the value of the exchange rate**\nThis policy is unlikely to be intended to increase the exchange rate. While tighter fiscal policy can sometimes lead to an appreciation of the currency by improving investor confidence or lowering inflation, an increase in indirect taxes has a more direct and opposing effect. It raises the prices of goods and services, which can contribute to cost-push inflation. Higher domestic prices can make a country's exports less competitive and its imports more attractive, potentially leading to a decrease, not an increase, in the value of the exchange rate. Exchange rates are more directly managed through monetary policy, such as changes in interest rates.\n\n**B: to redistribute income from higher to lower income groups**\nThis policy would have the opposite effect. Indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, are generally considered regressive. This means they take a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals than from higher-income individuals. This is because lower-income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their total income on goods and services that are subject to these taxes. Therefore, increasing indirect taxes tends to worsen income inequality rather than redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Progressive direct taxes (like income tax) are the primary tool for income redistribution.\n\n**D: to reduce the rate of inflation**\nWhile increasing taxes can be a tool to combat demand-pull inflation (by reducing consumers' disposable income and thus aggregate demand), increasing *indirect* taxes has a conflicting effect. An increase in indirect taxes raises the prices of goods and services directly, which contributes to cost-push inflation. Because the policy directly causes prices to rise, it is not a straightforward or effective tool for the primary purpose of reducing the overall rate of inflation and may, in fact, increase it in the short term."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_108.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "18 what is the most likely reason to increase government subsidies?\na __ to decrease consumption of a merit good\nb_ to increase consumption of a merit good\nc_ to decrease consumption of a demerit good\nd to increase consumption of a demerit good", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. to increase consumption of a merit good**\n\nA government subsidy is a financial payment made to producers to lower their costs of production. This reduction in cost is typically passed on to consumers in the form of a lower price. According to the law of demand, a lower price for a good or service leads to an increase in the quantity demanded, thereby increasing its consumption.\n\nA merit good is a good or service, such as education or healthcare, that is considered beneficial for both the individual consumer and society as a whole. However, if left to the free market, merit goods are often under-consumed because individuals may not fully perceive their long-term benefits or may not be able to afford them. This under-consumption represents a market failure.\n\nThe most likely reason for a government to provide a subsidy is to correct this market failure by encouraging greater consumption of a merit good. By making the merit good cheaper, the subsidy makes it more accessible and affordable, moving consumption closer to the socially optimal level.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. to decrease consumption of a merit good**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies both the effect of a subsidy and the government's objective for a merit good. A subsidy lowers the price of a good, which leads to an *increase*, not a decrease, in consumption. Furthermore, since merit goods are socially desirable, the government's goal is to encourage and increase their consumption, not reduce it.\n\n**C. to decrease consumption of a demerit good**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it proposes the wrong policy tool for the stated objective. A demerit good is a product, like cigarettes or alcohol, that is considered harmful and is over-consumed in a free market. The government's objective is indeed to *decrease* the consumption of demerit goods. However, a subsidy would have the opposite effect; by lowering the price, it would *increase* consumption. The appropriate policy to decrease the consumption of a demerit good would be an indirect tax, which raises the price.\n\n**D. to increase consumption of a demerit good**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the government's policy objective regarding demerit goods. While a subsidy would indeed increase the consumption of a good by making it cheaper, it is highly unlikely that a government would want to encourage the consumption of demerit goods. These goods generate negative externalities (harmful effects on third parties) and are detrimental to the consumer.

Debtors, or those who have borrowed money, benefit from this because the fixed amount of money they are required to repay is worth less in real terms than the money they originally borrowed. For example, if an individual has a fixed-interest loan, their regular repayments remain constant in nominal terms. However, as general prices and wages rise with inflation, these fixed repayments constitute a smaller proportion of their income, making the debt easier to manage. The real value of their outstanding debt effectively decreases, which is a financial gain.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: companies who sell abroad**\nCompanies that export goods are generally harmed by domestic inflation. Inflation increases their domestic costs of production (such as wages and raw materials). If the country's exchange rate does not depreciate to offset this, the price of their exports in foreign currency terms will rise. This makes their products less competitive in international markets, which can lead to a decrease in sales and profits.\n\n**B: foreign tourists visiting the country**\nForeign tourists are typically worse off during a period of inflation. Inflation means that the prices of local goods and services (like hotels, food, and transport) are increasing. While inflation can sometimes lead to a depreciation of the local currency, unless the currency's value falls by more than the rate of inflation, tourists will find that their foreign currency exchanges for local money that has less purchasing power. Their trip becomes more expensive as they can buy fewer goods and services for the same amount of their own currency.\n\n**C: those living on their savings**\nIndividuals living on savings, such as retirees with a fixed pension or those relying on interest from bank deposits, are negatively affected by inflation. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of their saved money. A fixed sum of savings will buy progressively fewer goods and services as prices rise. Furthermore, if the nominal interest rate earned on their savings is lower than the rate of inflation, the real rate of return is negative, meaning the real value of their savings is actively declining."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_110.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "20 the government of country z announces an increase in spending on work-place training.\nwhat is the effect of this supply-side policy likely to be?\na adecrease in country z\u2019s employment rate\nb- adecrease in country z\u2019s exchange rate\nc_anincrease in country z\u2019s economic growth rate\nd_anincrease in country z\u2019s interest rate", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn increase in government spending on work-place training is a supply-side policy aimed at improving the quality of the labour force. By enhancing workers' skills and knowledge, training increases labour productivity. Higher productivity means that more output can be produced with the same amount of labour input. This increases the economy's potential output, shifting the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to the right. An increase in the productive capacity of an economy is the basis for long-run economic growth, leading to a higher economic growth rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a decrease in country Z's employment rate**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in work-place training makes workers more skilled and adaptable, thereby increasing their employability. This policy helps to reduce structural unemployment, which arises from a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills required for available jobs. By improving skills, the policy is likely to lead to a higher employment rate (and a lower unemployment rate), not a decrease.\n\n**B: a decrease in country Z's exchange rate**\nThis is unlikely. Increased spending on training leads to a more productive workforce, which can lower firms' average costs of production. Lower costs make the country's goods and services more competitive on the international market, leading to an increase in exports. A rise in exports increases the demand for the country's currency, which would cause the exchange rate to appreciate (increase), not decrease.\n\n**D: an increase in country Z's interest rate**\nThis is not the primary or likely effect. Interest rates are the main tool of monetary policy, typically adjusted by a central bank to control inflation. A supply-side policy like increased training expands the productive capacity of the economy. By increasing aggregate supply, this policy can help to reduce long-term inflationary pressures. With lower pressure on the price level, the central bank would have less reason to raise interest rates; in fact, it may create conditions where interest rates could be kept stable or lowered.

As more individuals secure jobs, they begin to earn an income. Income tax is a direct tax levied by the government on the earnings of individuals and corporations. Therefore, with an increase in the number of people earning an income, the total amount of taxable income in the economy expands. This leads to a greater collection of income tax by the government, resulting in a rise in its tax revenue.\n\n***\n\n### Analysis of Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. downward pressure on wage rates**\n\nA falling level of unemployment indicates a tightening labour market, meaning the supply of available workers is decreasing relative to the demand for labour from firms. To attract and retain the smaller pool of available workers, firms must compete more intensely. This competition typically leads to firms offering higher wages and better working conditions. Consequently, a falling level of unemployment exerts *upward* pressure on wage rates, not downward pressure.\n\n**B. increase in welfare benefit payments**\n\nWelfare benefit payments, such as unemployment benefits (or Jobseeker's Allowance), are transfer payments made by the government to support individuals who are out of work. When the level of unemployment falls, it means fewer people are without a job and therefore fewer people are eligible to claim these benefits. This results in a *decrease* in government expenditure on welfare payments, not an increase.\n\n**C. rise in absolute poverty**\n\nAbsolute poverty refers to a state where individuals or households lack the income necessary to meet their most basic needs, such as food, clean water, and shelter. Unemployment is a primary driver of absolute poverty as it deprives individuals of a regular source of income. A falling level of unemployment means that more people are earning an income from employment.

The scenario states that due to unemployment and falling incomes, \"Some people can no longer pay the rent on their houses or buy the food they need.\" This is a direct description of an increase in the number of people falling into absolute poverty. Therefore, absolute poverty increases.\n\n*   **Relative poverty** is a measure of poverty in relation to the average (or median) standard of living in a society. A person is considered to be in relative poverty if their income is below a certain percentage of the median income. During a recession, while average incomes may fall, the impact is not distributed evenly. Many people become unemployed, causing their incomes to fall dramatically, while others may remain employed with smaller or no income reductions. This widens the income distribution and increases income inequality. As a result, more people will find their incomes are significantly lower than the new, lower median income, causing relative poverty to increase.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: increases / unchanged**\nThis option is incorrect because while absolute poverty increases, relative poverty does not remain unchanged. A recession typically exacerbates income inequality as job losses and income reductions are not uniform across the population. The gap between the lowest earners and the median earner widens, which, by definition, increases relative poverty.\n\n**C: unchanged / increases**\nThis option is incorrect because absolute poverty clearly increases.

Higher employment rates contribute to economic growth and a higher standard of living, directly supporting the government's goal.\n\n**C. a rise in life expectancy**\n\nAn increase in life expectancy is a positive indicator of development and poverty reduction. It reflects improvements in public health, nutrition, sanitation, and access to medical care. As people live longer, healthier lives, it signifies that the fundamental conditions associated with poverty are improving. This change would demonstrate that the government is making successful progress towards its target.\n\n**D. a rise in the level of adult literacy**\n\nA rise in the level of adult literacy is a crucial factor in reducing poverty. Higher literacy rates improve human capital, enabling individuals to secure better-paying jobs and increase their earning potential. Education empowers people, enhances productivity, and fosters economic development. Consequently, an increase in adult literacy would be a clear sign of progress in the fight against poverty."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_116.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 whatis nota reason for the decline in manufacturing industries in developed economies in recent\nyears?\na growth of newly industrialised competitor countries\nb _ invention of automated production methods\nc_ rising costs of factor inputs in the steel industry\nd_ considerable skill shortages as school-leavers prefer to work in the service sector", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe invention of automated production methods is a technological advancement that increases the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing industries. While automation often leads to a reduction in the number of employees required (a decline in manufacturing employment), it does not cause a decline in the industry's output or overall viability. In fact, by lowering production costs and increasing output, automation helps manufacturing firms in developed economies to remain competitive against international rivals. Therefore, it is a factor that transforms the manufacturing sector, making it more capital-intensive, rather than a primary reason for its decline in terms of productive capacity.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. growth of newly industrialised competitor countries**\n\nThis is a significant reason for the decline of manufacturing in developed economies. Newly Industrialised Countries (NICs) often have lower labour costs and less stringent regulations, giving them a comparative advantage in the production of manufactured goods. This allows them to produce goods more cheaply, leading to increased competition for firms in developed countries. As a result, many manufacturing firms in developed economies have been unable to compete on price, leading to factory closures and a shift of production overseas (offshoring), thus contributing to the decline of the domestic manufacturing sector.\n\n**C. rising costs of factor inputs in the steel industry**\n\nThis is a valid reason for the decline of specific manufacturing industries. Factor inputs are the resources used in production, such as labour, raw materials (e.g., iron ore, coal), and energy. If the costs of these inputs rise significantly in a developed economy, the total cost of production increases. This makes goods, such as steel, more expensive to produce domestically compared to in other countries. The higher price reduces the international competitiveness of the domestic industry, leading to lower demand, reduced output, and an overall decline.\n\n**D. considerable skill shortages as school-leavers prefer to work in the service sector**\n\nThis is a valid reason for the decline of manufacturing in developed economies. As economies develop, the tertiary (service) sector tends to expand and offer different types of employment opportunities, which many school-leavers find more appealing than traditional manufacturing roles. This shift in labour preference can lead to a shortage of workers with the necessary technical and engineering skills for the manufacturing sector. Such skill shortages can limit a firm's ability to operate efficiently, innovate, and expand, thereby contributing to the industry's long-term decline."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_117.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 the table shows a country\u2019s exports and imports.\n\nwe\nexports of goods 200\nimports of goods 190\nexports of services 35\nimports of services 38\n\nwhat was the country\u2019s balance of trade in goods and services?\n\na adeficit of $7 million\n\nba deficit of $13 million\n\nc_asurplus of $7 million\n\nd_asurplus of $13 million", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: C**\n\nThe balance of trade in goods and services, also known as the balance on the current account, is calculated by finding the difference between a country's total export earnings and its total import expenditure.\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Exports:** This is the sum of the value of exported goods and exported services.\n    *   Total Exports = Exports of goods + Exports of services\n    *   Total Exports = $200 million + $35 million = $235 million\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Imports:** This is the sum of the value of imported goods and imported services.\n    *   Total Imports = Imports of goods + Imports of services\n    *   Total Imports = $190 million + $38 million = $228 million\n\n3.  **Calculate the Balance of Trade:** Subtract total imports from total exports.\n    *   Balance of Trade = Total Exports \u2013 Total Imports\n    *   Balance of Trade = $235 million \u2013 $228 million = +$7 million\n\nA positive result indicates a trade surplus, meaning the country earned more from its exports than it spent on its imports. Therefore, the country has a surplus of $7 million.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: a deficit of $7 million**\nThis is incorrect. A trade deficit occurs when a country's total imports are greater than its total exports. In this case, total exports ($235 million) are greater than total imports ($228 million), resulting in a surplus. This answer correctly identifies the magnitude of the balance but incorrectly classifies it as a deficit.\n\n**B: a deficit of $13 million**\nThis is incorrect in both value and classification. A deficit means imports exceed exports, which is not the case here. The value of $13 million may have been calculated by incorrectly adding the surplus in goods ($10 million) to the absolute value of the deficit in services ($3 million) and then mislabeling the result as a deficit.\n\n**D: a surplus of $13 million**\nThis is incorrect. While the country does have a trade surplus, the value is incorrect. This error typically arises from calculating the balance of trade in goods ($200m - $190m = $10m surplus) and the balance of trade in services ($35m - $38m = -$3m deficit) separately, and then incorrectly adding their absolute values (10 + 3 = 13) instead of netting the actual values ($10m - $3m = $7m)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_118.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 country x exports steel to country y at a price below its cost of production. this has led to a fall in\ndemand for steel produced in country y.\nwhat is a method of trade protection that country y could use to reduce the imports of steel from\ncountry x?\na apply anti-dumping tariffs\nb \"increase interest rates\nc_revalue the currency\nd _ subsidise the export of steel", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe practice of a country exporting goods to another country at a price below their domestic cost of production is known as **dumping**. This is considered an unfair trade practice because it can harm domestic producers in the importing country by making it impossible for them to compete on price.\n\nTo counteract this, the government of the importing country (Country Y) can implement a specific form of trade protection called an **anti-dumping tariff**. This is a tax placed specifically on the imported goods that are being dumped. The tariff increases the price of the imported steel, bringing it closer to a fair market value. This makes the domestically produced steel in Country Y more price-competitive, which helps to protect the domestic industry and reduce the quantity of cheap imports.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. increase interest rates:**\nThis is a tool of monetary policy, not a direct method of trade protection. Increasing interest rates tends to attract foreign financial investment, which increases the demand for the country's currency and causes it to appreciate (strengthen). A stronger currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive. Therefore, increasing interest rates in Country Y would likely make the imported steel from Country X even cheaper, increasing imports rather than reducing them.\n\n**C. revalue the currency:**\nRevaluation is a deliberate policy to increase the official value of a country's currency relative to other currencies. Similar to the effect of increasing interest rates, a stronger (revalued) currency makes imported goods less expensive for domestic consumers. This would worsen the problem for Country Y's steel producers by making the dumped steel from Country X even more attractive, thus increasing imports.\n\n**D. subsidise the export of steel:**\nAn export subsidy is a payment from the government to domestic producers for each unit of a good they sell abroad. This policy is designed to boost a country's exports by making its goods cheaper in foreign markets. It does not address the problem of cheap imports harming the domestic market. Country Y's goal is to protect its domestic steel industry from foreign competition within its own borders, not to increase its own steel exports to other countries."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_119.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "29 what would increase the demand for a country\u2019s currency on the foreign exchange market?\na adecrease in its inward investment\nb- adecrease in its rate of interest\nc_anincrease in its exports\nd_anincrease in its imports", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn increase in a country's exports signifies that more foreign individuals, firms, or governments are buying its goods and services. To pay for these exports, they must use the exporter's currency. Consequently, they will need to exchange their own currency for the exporter's currency on the foreign exchange market. This rise in the buying of the country's currency by foreigners directly translates to an increase in the demand for that currency.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a decrease in its inward investment**\nInward investment occurs when foreign entities invest in a country's assets, such as building factories or buying stocks and bonds. This requires them to purchase the domestic currency. Therefore, a *decrease* in inward investment would mean less foreign money is flowing into the country, leading to a *decrease* in the demand for its currency, not an increase.\n\n**B. a decrease in its rate of interest**\nInterest rates influence international flows of 'hot money' (short-term portfolio investment). Higher interest rates attract foreign savers seeking better returns, who must buy the domestic currency to deposit their funds. Conversely, a *decrease* in the interest rate makes saving in that country less attractive compared to other countries. This would cause foreign investors to move their money elsewhere, thus *decreasing* the demand for the currency.\n\n**D. an increase in its imports**\nImports are goods and services purchased from other countries. To pay for these foreign goods, domestic residents and firms must acquire the foreign currency. They do this by selling their own domestic currency on the foreign exchange market.

To improve this situation, a country needs to either reduce its expenditure on imports or increase its revenue from exports.\n\nAn import quota is a protectionist measure that sets a physical limit on the quantity of a specific good that can be imported into a country over a period of time. Lowering an import quota means making the restriction tighter by reducing the maximum quantity of a good that is allowed to be imported. This policy directly limits the volume of imports. By reducing the quantity of goods being imported, the total expenditure on imports decreases. This reduction in the outflow of money from the country helps to decrease the current account deficit.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B) lowering income tax**\n\nLowering income tax increases the disposable income of households. With more money available to spend, consumers are likely to increase their overall consumption. A portion of this increased spending will be on imported goods and services. An increase in demand for imports leads to a larger outflow of currency, which would worsen the current account deficit, not improve it.\n\n**C) lowering import tariffs**\n\nAn import tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. Lowering tariffs makes these imported goods cheaper for domestic consumers and firms. According to the law of demand, a lower price generally leads to an increase in the quantity demanded. Therefore, lowering import tariffs would likely increase the demand for and expenditure on imports, thereby worsening the current account deficit.\n\n**D) lowering export subsidies**\n\nAn export subsidy is a payment from the government to a domestic firm to encourage it to export its products. The subsidy lowers the firm's production costs, allowing it to sell its goods at a more competitive (lower) price in international markets, which helps to boost exports. Conversely, *lowering* or removing an export subsidy makes a country's exports more expensive and less competitive abroad. This would lead to a decrease in the quantity of exports sold and a reduction in export revenue, which would worsen the current account deficit."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_121.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "1 gdp per capita in switzerland is high.\nwhat is the reason why swiss citizens still face the basic economic problem?\na __ income in switzerland is unevenly distributed.\nb inflation in switzerland is high.\nc_ swiss citizens expect high living standards.\nd_ swiss citizens have to make choices in consumption.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe basic economic problem is scarcity, which is the fundamental issue that human wants for goods and services are infinite, while the resources available to produce them are finite. This imbalance forces all economic agents\u2014individuals, firms, and governments\u2014to make choices about how to allocate their limited resources. Even in a country with a high GDP per capita like Switzerland, individuals still have finite incomes and time. They cannot afford everything they desire, so they must make consumption choices, such as deciding between buying a new car or going on an expensive holiday. This necessity of making choices is the direct consequence of scarcity and is the essence of the basic economic problem.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Income in Switzerland is unevenly distributed.**\nWhile income inequality is a significant economic issue present in most countries, it is not the basic economic problem itself. The basic economic problem of scarcity would exist even if income were distributed perfectly evenly. In such a scenario, every citizen would still have a finite income and would face the challenge of allocating it among their unlimited wants, thus still needing to make choices. Income distribution is a question of equity, whereas scarcity is a question of limited resources versus unlimited wants.\n\n**B) Inflation in Switzerland is high.**\nInflation refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, leading to a fall in the purchasing power of money. While high inflation can make the economic problem more acute by reducing what people can afford, it is not the fundamental cause of the problem. The basic economic problem of scarcity exists in economies with high inflation, low inflation, or even deflation. The core issue remains the mismatch between finite resources and infinite wants, regardless of price stability.\n\n**C) Swiss citizens expect high living standards.**\nExpecting high living standards relates to the \"infinite wants\" part of the basic economic problem. However, it only describes one side of the issue. The problem itself arises from the conflict between these wants (whether high or low) and the limited resources available to satisfy them. Stating that citizens must make choices (as in option D) is a more complete and accurate description of the basic economic problem, as it encompasses both the wants and the constraint of limited resources that forces a decision.

This is caused by an increase in the quantity or an improvement in the quality of the factors of production. Improved education enhances the skills, knowledge, and productivity of the workforce. This improvement in the quality of labour (human capital) means that more goods and services (both capital and consumer goods) can be produced with the same amount of resources, leading to an expansion of the country's productive capacity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** A decrease in the rate of unemployment means that the economy is moving from a point of inefficiency (inside the PPC) towards a point of efficiency (on the PPC).

The market is balanced, and there is no inherent tendency for the price or quantity to change, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. demand exceeds supply**\nThis describes a situation of disequilibrium known as a shortage or excess demand. When demand exceeds supply at a given price, there are more buyers than there are goods available. This condition creates upward pressure on the price, as consumers may be willing to pay more to obtain the limited product. The market will only reach equilibrium when the price rises to a level where quantity demanded falls and quantity supplied rises to meet each other.\n\n**B. no profits are earned**\nThis statement is not necessarily true for a market in equilibrium.

The quantity of this overproduction is the difference between the market quantity (Q\u2081) and the socially optimal quantity (Q\u2082). This is represented by the distance Q\u2082Q\u2081. This overproduction leads to a deadweight loss, signifying an inefficient allocation of resources.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n*   **A. OQ\u2081:** This distance represents the total quantity of petrol produced and consumed at the free market equilibrium. It is the outcome of the market when externalities are ignored, but it is not the measure of the failure itself. The failure is the *excess* production, not the total production.\n\n*   **B. OQ\u2082:** This distance represents the socially optimal quantity of petrol. This is the allocatively efficient level of output that would maximise social welfare. It serves as the benchmark to identify the market failure, but it is not the failure itself.\n\n*   **D. Q\u2083Q\u2081:** The point Q\u2083 represents the quantity at which the private marginal cost of production is zero (where the S\u209a curve intercepts the x-axis). The distance Q\u2083Q\u2081 does not represent a meaningful economic concept in the context of market failure. The failure is specifically defined by the divergence between the market outcome (Q\u2081) and the socially optimal outcome (Q\u2082)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_129.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "9 in agiven year, the world output of coal was 3.94 billion metric tonnes at an average yearly price\nof $252 per metric tonne.\nseveral years later, world output was 3.66 billion metric tonnes at an average yearly price of\n$120 per metric tonne.\nwhat might have caused such a fall in the price of coal?\na almost half the world\u2019s coal reserves were in just two countries\nb__ the exhaustion of coal seams throughout the world\nc the switch to renewable sources of energy\nd the use of coal as a raw material as well as a fuel", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA fall in both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of a good is caused by a decrease in demand. The demand curve for coal has shifted to the left. A switch to renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, means that consumers (primarily power generation companies) have found alternative ways to meet their energy needs. As renewable energy becomes more accessible and cost-effective, it serves as a substitute for coal. An increased preference for or availability of a substitute good will lead to a decrease in the demand for the original good, in this case, coal. This reduction in demand results in both a lower price and a lower quantity of coal being sold, which is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. almost half the world's coal reserves were in just two countries**\nThis statement describes the concentration of supply, which is a factor affecting the supply curve and market structure. A high concentration of reserves does not, in itself, explain a fall in price. In fact, if the two countries with large reserves were to collude to restrict output (acting as a cartel), this would decrease supply and lead to a *higher* price. This option does not explain the dynamic change of a falling price and falling output over time.\n\n**B. the exhaustion of coal seams throughout the world**\nThe exhaustion of coal seams means that it becomes more difficult and costly to extract coal. This would cause a decrease in the supply of coal, shifting the supply curve to the left. A leftward shift in the supply curve results in a *higher* equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity. The data in the question shows a *fall* in price, which directly contradicts the outcome of this supply-side shock.\n\n**D. the use of coal as a raw material as well as a fuel**\nThis statement simply describes the nature of the demand for coal, indicating that it has multiple uses. While this contributes to the overall level of demand, it is a static description and does not explain why the demand, and consequently the price and quantity, would have fallen over several years. For the price to fall, the demand from these uses would have had to decrease, a point which this option does not address."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_130.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "10 a government believes that people eat too much sugar but not enough fruit.\nwhich combination of policies would the government introduce?\nee\n\na increase its tax increase its tax\nb increase its tax subsidise its production\ncc subsidise its production increase its tax\nd subsidise its production subsidise its production", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAn indirect tax is a levy placed on goods and services, which increases the cost of production for firms.

To encourage the consumption of a good like fruit, which is considered a merit good, the government can provide a subsidy for its production. This allows producers to supply more fruit at every price level, leading to a lower market price for consumers.

This role is activated specifically when a commercial bank, despite being solvent (its assets are worth more than its liabilities), faces a liquidity crisis. A liquidity crisis occurs when the bank does not have enough liquid assets (cash) to meet its short-term obligations, such as honouring withdrawals by depositors. By providing emergency, short-term loans, the central bank ensures the commercial bank can meet these demands, which prevents a potential bank run and the risk of the crisis spreading to other banks in the financial system (systemic risk).\n\n### Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B: when a commercial bank fails to make a profit**\n    The profitability of a commercial bank is the concern of its management and shareholders. A bank can be unprofitable for a period without necessarily facing a liquidity crisis or being insolvent. The central bank's mandate is to ensure the stability of the financial system, not to guarantee the profitability of individual private institutions. Intervention as a lender of last resort is linked to liquidity and solvency issues that threaten the wider system, not to poor business performance.\n\n*   **C: when a commercial bank needs to raise share capital**\n    Raising share capital is a method for a bank to obtain long-term funds by issuing ownership shares to investors. This is typically done to strengthen the bank's capital base, finance expansion, or meet regulatory requirements. It is a planned, long-term financing activity, not an emergency situation. The lender of last resort provides short-term loans (debt), not equity capital.\n\n*   **D: when a commercial bank reduces its lending rates**\n    A commercial bank's decision to reduce its lending rates is a standard business strategy. It is typically done to attract more borrowers, increase market share, or in response to changes in the central bank's own policy rate.

When a trade union represents and supplies all the workers required by an employer (a situation often referred to as a \"closed shop\" or a monopoly supply of labour), it has maximum control. If the union initiates industrial action, such as a strike, the employer has no alternative source of labour to continue operations. This ability to completely halt production gives the union significant leverage in negotiations over wages, benefits, and working conditions, thereby greatly increasing its bargaining power.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. when the economy is experiencing rising cyclical unemployment**\nRising cyclical unemployment, which occurs during an economic recession, weakens a trade union's bargaining power. A high level of unemployment means there is a large surplus of available labour in the economy. If union members go on strike, the employer can more easily find and hire non-unionised, unemployed workers as replacements. This large \"reserve army of labour\" diminishes the impact of a strike and reduces the union's ability to pressure the employer into accepting its demands.\n\n**B. when the labour market moves from long-term to short-term contracts of employment**\nA shift towards short-term, temporary, or \"gig\" economy contracts tends to decrease a trade union's bargaining power. It is more difficult for unions to organise and build solidarity among a transient workforce. Workers on short-term contracts may be hesitant to join a union or participate in industrial action due to fear of not having their contracts renewed. A stable, long-term workforce is more likely to have the cohesion and security needed for effective collective bargaining.\n\n**C. when the price elasticity of demand for the product is price-elastic**\nA trade union's bargaining power is weaker when the demand for the product its members produce is price-elastic. If the union successfully negotiates a wage increase, the employer's costs rise. The employer will likely try to pass this cost on to consumers by increasing the product's price. If demand is elastic, this price increase will lead to a proportionally larger decrease in the quantity demanded. The subsequent fall in sales and revenue would force the firm to significantly cut back on production and lay off a large number of workers. The threat of causing widespread job losses for its own members limits the union's willingness to push for large wage increases, thus weakening its bargaining position."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_134.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "14 what is a likely reason why firms do not grow in size?\na_ external diseconomies of scale occur at high levels of output.\nb internal economies of scale occur at high levels of output.\nc internal economies of scale occur at low levels of output.\nd internal diseconomies of scale occur at low levels of output.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nInternal diseconomies of scale are the factors that cause long-run average costs to rise as a firm increases its scale of production beyond a certain point. These inefficiencies arise from within the firm and are typically associated with the challenges of managing a larger organisation. Examples include poor communication between departments, difficulties in coordinating complex operations, and a decline in staff morale and motivation. If a firm begins to experience these issues at a relatively low level of output, its average costs will start to increase quickly as it tries to expand. This rise in costs would reduce profitability and act as a significant barrier, providing a strong reason for the firm to remain small and not grow in size.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. External diseconomies of scale occur at high levels of output.**\nExternal diseconomies of scale are cost disadvantages that affect a firm due to the growth of the industry in which it operates, not necessarily the growth of the firm itself. Examples include increased traffic congestion or higher prices for raw materials due to industry-wide demand. While these factors can increase a firm's costs and make expansion less attractive, they affect all firms in the industry. They do not specifically explain why one particular firm would choose not to grow, as the most direct constraints on a single firm's size are typically internal.\n\n**B. Internal economies of scale occur at high levels of output.**\nInternal economies of scale refer to the cost advantages a firm gains as it grows larger, leading to a fall in long-run average costs. Examples include bulk-buying discounts and technical efficiencies. The occurrence of these economies of scale, whether at low or high levels of output, provides a powerful incentive for a firm to increase its size and production to become more efficient and profitable. Therefore, this is a reason *for* a firm to grow, not a reason to limit its growth.\n\n**C. Internal economies of scale occur at low levels of output.**\nThis describes the typical situation for a new or small firm. As it increases production from a low base, it can take advantage of internal economies of scale, which lowers its average cost per unit. This falling cost provides a strong incentive to continue expanding production and grow the business to achieve greater efficiency.

These benefits are 'external' because they arise from factors outside the individual firm's own production decisions. When firms making similar products locate near each other, they can all benefit from a shared pool of skilled labour that is attracted to the area, the establishment of specialist suppliers and support services, and the development of industry-specific infrastructure. This clustering leads to lower average costs for all firms in the location, making it a powerful incentive for them to agglomerate.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **A: Competition is decreased.** This is incorrect. When firms that produce similar goods or services locate in close proximity, competition typically intensifies. They must compete more directly for the same customers, skilled workers, and local raw materials. While firms may cluster despite this, it is a disadvantage they must overcome, not a reason for doing so.\n\n*   **C: There are internal economies of scale.** This is incorrect. Internal economies of scale are the cost advantages that a single firm gains as it increases its own scale of production (i.e., as the firm itself grows).

The question concerns benefits derived from the location and proximity of *other* firms, which are external, not internal, factors.\n\n*   **D: Transport costs may be eliminated.** This is an overstatement and therefore incorrect. While locating near suppliers can reduce the transport costs of inputs, and clustering can attract suppliers to the area, it does not 'eliminate' them entirely.

This makes the country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers to purchase. According to the law of demand, a lower price for a good or service will lead to a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, by making exports more price-competitive on the international market, a devaluation directly stimulates an increase in the volume of exports.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. a restriction of bank credit creation**\nThis is a contractionary monetary policy measure. By restricting the ability of banks to create credit (lend money), the government or central bank reduces the overall money supply and makes it more difficult for firms to borrow. This could hinder the ability of exporting firms to invest in new equipment or finance their operations, potentially reducing their capacity to produce goods for export. This measure is typically used to control inflation or cool down an overheating economy, and it does not directly lead to an increase in exports.\n\n**C. an increase in the rate of interest**\nThis is also a contractionary monetary policy. An increase in the domestic interest rate makes it more attractive for foreign investors to save their money in the country's banks to earn a higher return. To do this, they must first purchase the domestic currency, which increases the demand for it. This increased demand leads to an appreciation of the currency's exchange rate (it becomes stronger). A stronger currency makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in the quantity of exports.\n\n**D. the issue of more bank notes and coins**\nIssuing more currency increases the money supply. This is an expansionary monetary policy. A significant increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in the output of goods and services typically leads to inflation.

When income tax is lowered, households have a higher disposable income (the amount of money left after paying direct taxes). This increase in disposable income typically leads to a rise in consumer spending (consumption). As consumption is a major component of aggregate demand (AD), an increase in spending boosts AD.

Decreasing this spending would reduce aggregate demand in the economy. This is a contractionary fiscal policy, which would slow down economic growth and hinder, rather than assist, an economic recovery.\n\n**C. increasing indirect taxation**\nIncreasing indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes, makes goods and services more expensive for consumers.

Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for both consumers and firms, which discourages spending on credit and investment in new capital. It also incentivises saving over spending.

With more money chasing a limited supply of goods, prices are bid up, leading to a rise in inflation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of high economic growth caused by an increase in consumer spending is a rise in inflation and a fall in unemployment.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: inflation falls and unemployment falls**\n\nWhile it is correct that unemployment would fall due to increased production and hiring, it is incorrect that inflation would fall. A surge in consumer spending increases aggregate demand, which causes demand-pull inflation. Prices would rise, not fall. A scenario where both inflation and unemployment fall is typically associated with economic growth driven by an increase in aggregate supply (e.g., due to technological advancements), not an increase in aggregate demand.\n\n**B: inflation falls and unemployment rises**\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. High economic growth driven by consumer spending leads to lower unemployment, not higher. Furthermore, increased demand pushes prices up, causing inflation to rise, not fall. A situation of rising unemployment and falling inflation (or deflation) is characteristic of an economic recession or downturn, which is the opposite of the scenario described.\n\n**D: inflation rises and unemployment rises**\n\nWhile it is correct that inflation would rise due to increased aggregate demand, it is incorrect that unemployment would also rise. High economic growth necessitates increased production, which requires more workers, thus causing unemployment to fall. The combination of rising inflation and rising unemployment is a phenomenon known as stagflation, which is typically caused by a negative supply-side shock (a decrease in aggregate supply), not by an increase in consumer spending."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_142.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "22 which pair is most likely to be provided by the private sector in a mixed economy?\na courts and prisons\nb hospitals and tax collection\nc insurance and banks\nd weapon manufacture and defence", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn a mixed economy, the private sector consists of businesses owned by private individuals and operated for profit. Both **insurance** and **banks** are classic examples of financial services that are typically provided by the private sector. These businesses compete with each other, offering various products (e.g., insurance policies, loans, bank accounts) to consumers and other businesses with the primary aim of generating profit. While governments regulate these industries and may offer some state-run alternatives (like a state bank or social insurance), the core provision of these services in most mixed economies is dominated by private enterprise.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: courts and prisons**\nThis pair is incorrect because courts and prisons are fundamental components of a country's legal and justice system. These are considered core functions of the state (the public sector). The provision of justice and the administration of punishment must be impartial and serve the public interest, rather than being driven by a profit motive. Therefore, they are almost universally funded and operated by the government.\n\n**B: hospitals and tax collection**\nThis pair is incorrect because tax collection is an exclusive and essential function of the government (the public sector). The government requires tax revenue to fund public services like defence, infrastructure, and education. This function cannot be outsourced to a for-profit private entity. While hospitals can be, and often are, run by the private sector in a mixed economy, the inclusion of tax collection makes this option incorrect.\n\n**D: weapon manufacture and defence**\nThis pair is incorrect because national defence is a classic example of a public good. It is non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning it is impossible to prevent citizens from benefiting from it, and one person's consumption does not reduce its availability to others. Due to the free-rider problem, the private sector would not adequately provide national defence, making it a core responsibility of the public sector. While private firms may manufacture weapons under government contracts, the provision of defence itself is a state function."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_143.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 an economy is experiencing a sustained fall in the general price level.\nwhich term is used to describe this?\na deflation\nb_ depreciation\nc_ market disequilibrium\nd_ recession", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nDeflation is the economic term for a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy. This occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). As the general price level falls, the purchasing power of money increases, meaning each unit of currency can buy more goods and services.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B) depreciation**\nDepreciation refers to the fall in the value of a country's currency in relation to other currencies within a floating exchange rate system. It is concerned with the external value of a currency (its exchange rate), not its internal purchasing power. While deflation relates to a general fall in domestic prices, depreciation relates to a fall in how much foreign currency can be exchanged for one unit of the domestic currency.\n\n**C) market disequilibrium**\nMarket disequilibrium occurs in a specific market when the quantity of a good or service supplied is not equal to the quantity demanded. This results in either a surplus (excess supply) or a shortage (excess demand). While widespread surpluses across many markets could contribute to a fall in the general price level, \"market disequilibrium\" is the term for the imbalance itself, not the resulting sustained fall in the economy's overall price level.\n\n**D) recession**\nA recession is a period of significant decline in economic activity across an economy. It is officially defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A recession is a measure of the economy's output and income, not its price level.

It is defined in relation to the changing living standards of the population as a whole. An increase in relative poverty means the income gap between the poorest households and the median household has widened.\n\nIf pension increases are lower than the rate of inflation, the real income (i.e., the purchasing power) of pensioners falls. While their nominal pension amount may have risen, it can buy fewer goods and services than before. At the same time, the wages of the working population tend to rise at least in line with inflation to maintain their real income. Consequently, the income of pensioners falls relative to the income of the average working household. This widens the income disparity and increases the number of pensioners living in relative poverty.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: an increase in state benefits**\nState benefits, such as unemployment payments or income support, are transfer payments made to individuals and households with low or no income. An increase in the value of these benefits directly raises the income of the poorest members of society. This would move their income level closer to the national average, thereby reducing the income gap and *decreasing*, not increasing, relative poverty.\n\n**B: an increase in the national minimum wage**\nThe national minimum wage establishes a legal wage floor, preventing employers from paying workers less than a certain hourly rate. Increasing the national minimum wage directly boosts the earnings of the lowest-paid workers. This raises their income relative to the median income, which helps to compress the wage distribution and *reduce* relative poverty.\n\n**D: people working beyond retirement age**\nWhen individuals choose to work beyond the standard retirement age, they continue to earn a wage or salary, which is typically higher than the state pension they would otherwise receive. This increases their income, making them less likely to fall into relative poverty. This trend would therefore tend to *decrease* the overall rate of relative poverty, particularly among the elderly population."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_145.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 what might explain the high population growth in some developing countries?\na high birth rates and falling death rates\nb_ low immigration and high emigration\nc falling birth rates and rising death rates\nd falling life expectancy", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nHigh population growth is primarily driven by the rate of natural increase, which is the difference between the birth rate (the number of live births per 1,000 people per year) and the death rate (the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year). In many developing countries, advancements in public health, sanitation, and medical care have led to a significant decrease in death rates, particularly infant mortality. However, birth rates often remain high due to factors such as cultural traditions favouring large families, a young population age structure, and limited access to education and family planning. The wide gap between a high birth rate and a falling death rate results in a large natural increase and, consequently, rapid population growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: low immigration and high emigration**\nThis describes a situation of net outward migration, where more people are leaving the country (emigration) than entering it (immigration). Net outward migration leads to a decrease in the total population, or at least slows down its growth. Therefore, this would counteract high population growth, not explain it.\n\n**C: falling birth rates and rising death rates**\nThis combination would lead to a negative or very low rate of natural increase. If the death rate were to exceed the birth rate, the population would decline. This scenario is the opposite of what is required to explain high population growth.\n\n**D: falling life expectancy**\nLife expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to live. A falling life expectancy implies that, on average, people are dying at a younger age, which is characteristic of a rising death rate. A rising death rate would slow down population growth or lead to a population decrease, not explain high population growth.

A poor education system indicates low levels of human capital, meaning the workforce is less skilled and productive. This constrains economic growth and innovation. A low standard of living is a direct measure of development and encompasses factors such as low per capita income, inadequate access to healthcare, poor housing, and limited consumption of goods and services. Together, a poor education system and a low standard of living are fundamental indicators used to classify a country as developing.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a government budget deficit and a low death rate**\nThis combination is not a defining characteristic of a developing country. A government budget deficit (where government spending exceeds tax revenue) can occur in any country, regardless of its development status. Many highly developed countries consistently run budget deficits. Similarly, a low death rate is not exclusive to developed countries. Advances in basic healthcare and sanitation have led to significant decreases in death rates in many developing nations. Therefore, these two factors do not reliably distinguish a developing country from a developed one.\n\n**B. a high birth rate and a low death rate**\nWhile a high birth rate combined with a low death rate leads to rapid population growth, which is a common demographic feature in many developing countries (often described as Stage 2 or 3 of the Demographic Transition Model), it is not the primary basis for classification. Economic classification focuses more on economic and social welfare indicators like income, education, and standard of living. Some countries may still be classified as developing even after their birth rates have started to decline. This combination describes a demographic trend rather than the core economic conditions that define a country as \"developing\".\n\n**C. a large population and a current account deficit**\nNeither a large population nor a current account deficit is a reliable indicator of a country's development status. There are developed countries with large populations (e.g., the United States) and small populations (e.g., Luxembourg). Likewise, there are developing countries with large populations (e.g., India) and small populations (e.g., Bhutan). A current account deficit (where imports exceed exports) can also be found in both developed countries (e.g., the United States) and developing countries.

This increased efficiency leads to a surplus of the specialised goods. To acquire the goods and services they no longer produce, countries must trade their surplus with other nations. Therefore, greater specialisation inherently creates a greater need and incentive for international trade.\n*   **Falling transport costs:** A reduction in the cost of shipping, air freight, and other logistics makes it cheaper to move goods between countries. This lowers the final price of imported goods for consumers and makes a country's exports more price-competitive in foreign markets. Lower costs directly reduce a major barrier to trade, thus encouraging a higher volume of transactions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. conservation of resources and unstable exchange rates**\nThis combination would discourage, not encourage, international trade. Conservation of resources might limit the volume of goods a country can produce for export. More significantly, unstable exchange rates create uncertainty and risk for importers and exporters. Fluctuations in currency values make it difficult to predict costs and revenues, which can deter businesses from entering into international contracts.\n\n**B. exploitation of resources and wider use of quotas**\nWhile the exploitation of resources might temporarily increase the supply of raw materials for export, the wider use of quotas would have the opposite effect on trade. A quota is a government-imposed quantitative limit on the amount of a good that can be imported. It is a form of protectionism designed specifically to restrict the volume of international trade to protect domestic industries. The definite trade-restricting nature of quotas makes this option incorrect.\n\n**C. increased support for home industries and increased tariffs**\nBoth of these policies are forms of protectionism that are designed to reduce the level of international trade. Increased support for home industries, such as subsidies, makes domestic products artificially cheaper, thereby reducing the demand for imports. Increased tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods, which raises their price and makes them less attractive to domestic consumers. Both policies aim to shield domestic producers from foreign competition by restricting imports."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_148.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 the import of a product from another country has been banned.\nwhich term describes this method of protection?\na embargo\nb_ exchange control\nc quota\nd tariff", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAn **embargo** is a government order that completely prohibits the import or export of certain goods, or all trade, with a specific country. The scenario describes a situation where the import of a product has been \"banned,\" which is synonymous with an embargo. This is the most severe form of trade barrier, as it completely cuts off the supply of the specified product from the foreign country. Embargoes are often put in place for political reasons but can also be used for economic protection or for health and safety concerns.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. exchange control**\nExchange controls are government restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that can be bought or sold. By limiting the availability of foreign currency, a government can make it more difficult for domestic firms to pay for imports. While this reduces the overall level of imports, it is an indirect method of protection and does not constitute an outright ban on a specific product.\n\n**C. quota**\nA quota is a physical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country during a specific period. For example, a government might limit the import of foreign cars to 10,000 units per year. A quota restricts the supply of imports but does not completely prohibit them. A ban, as described in the question, is equivalent to a quota of zero, but the specific term for a total prohibition is an embargo.\n\n**D. tariff**\nA tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. This tax increases the price of the imported product for domestic consumers, making domestic goods relatively cheaper and more competitive.

The price of fish sold as exports would become cheaper.**\n\nAn exchange rate depreciation means the value of a country's currency has fallen in relation to other currencies. Consequently, foreigners need to give up less of their own currency to buy the domestic currency. This makes the country's goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers. In this scenario, fish is a major export. Therefore, a depreciation of the domestic currency will lower the price of fish for international customers, which is likely to increase the demand for these exports.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Imported goods would become cheaper for local people.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A depreciation of the domestic currency means that more units of the local currency are required to purchase one unit of a foreign currency. As a result, goods imported from other countries, which are priced in foreign currencies, become more expensive for local people to buy.\n\n**B. The country would definitely become poorer.**\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While the cost of imports increases, which can raise the cost of living and production, the volume and value of exports (like fish and tourism) are likely to increase because they are now cheaper for foreigners. If the increase in export revenue is greater than the increase in the import bill, the country's balance of trade could improve, potentially leading to economic growth rather than decline. The overall effect on the country's wealth is ambiguous, making the word \"definitely\" incorrect.\n\n**D. Tourists to the country would be discouraged by higher prices.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Tourism is a service export. When the country's currency depreciates, it becomes cheaper for foreign tourists to visit. Their own currency now has greater purchasing power, allowing them to buy more local goods and services (e.g., hotel stays, food, souvenirs) for the same amount of their money.

In economics, a **free good** is a good that is not scarce and therefore has no opportunity cost associated with its production or consumption.

While they are offered at a zero monetary price to the consumer, they are not free goods in an economic sense. Scarce resources, such as raw materials, labour, and capital, were used to produce these samples. This means there is an opportunity cost \u2013 these resources could have been used to produce other goods or services. The cost is simply borne by the producer as a marketing or promotional expense, not eliminated. Therefore, free samples are economic goods.\n\n**B. health services provided by the state** are incorrect. Although these services may be free at the point of use for citizens, they are not free goods. Providing healthcare requires a vast amount of scarce resources, including skilled labour (doctors, nurses), capital (hospitals, equipment), and land. These resources have a significant opportunity cost. The government funds these services through taxation, meaning the money could have been spent on other public services like education or defence, or left in the hands of taxpayers to spend themselves. Thus, state-provided health services are economic goods.\n\n**C. second-hand clothing** is incorrect. Second-hand clothing is an **economic good**, not a free good. It is a scarce item; the supply is limited. Resources were used in its original production, and it typically has a market price, however low.

The vertical axis of the demand graph represents the price of the good, while the horizontal axis represents the quantity demanded.\n\nTo construct a demand curve, the price of the good is intentionally varied to observe how the quantity demanded responds. Each point on the curve corresponds to a specific price and the associated quantity demanded. Therefore, the price of the good itself is the independent variable that changes, causing a **movement along** the existing demand curve. It is fundamentally not held constant.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. consumers' incomes**\n**B. tastes and preferences**\n**C. the price of substitutes**\n\nWhen drawing a single demand curve, economists use the principle of *ceteris paribus*, which is Latin for \"all other things being equal.\" This assumption is crucial for isolating the relationship between a good's own price and its quantity demanded. The factors listed in options A, B, and C are key \"determinants of demand\" that are held constant under the *ceteris paribus* assumption.\n\n*   **Consumers' incomes:** A consumer's income level directly affects their purchasing power. If incomes were to change, the entire demand curve would shift to a new position (e.g., a rise in income for a normal good would shift the curve to the right). To analyse the effect of price alone, income must be assumed to be constant.\n*   **Tastes and preferences:** Consumer preferences for a good can change due to advertising, trends, or new information. A change in tastes would cause a shift in the entire demand curve. Therefore, to draw one specific demand curve, tastes and preferences are held constant.\n*   **The price of substitutes:** A substitute is a good that can be used in place of another. If the price of a substitute good changes, it will affect the demand for the original good (e.g., if the price of a substitute falls, demand for the original good will decrease, shifting the curve to the left). To isolate the demand for one good, the prices of all related goods, including substitutes, must be held constant.\n\nIn summary, changes in income, tastes, or the price of substitutes cause the entire demand curve to **shift**, representing a change in overall demand.

This means that at any given price, airlines are willing and able to offer a greater quantity of flights or seats. A primary determinant of supply is the cost of production. A decrease in the costs of production, such as lower fuel prices, reduced airport fees, or more efficient aircraft, makes it more profitable for airlines to operate.

The supply curve reflects the producers' (airlines') willingness and ability to sell, which is not directly affected by the price of other transport modes.\n\n**D:** An increase in a tax on air travel represents an increase in the cost of production for airlines. Higher costs reduce the profitability of supplying flights at any given price. Consequently, airlines would be willing to supply a smaller quantity at each price level, leading to a decrease in supply.

Substitute goods are products that consumers perceive as alternatives to each other, such as tea and coffee. If the price of coffee rises, consumers will find tea to be a relatively cheaper option. Consequently, some consumers will switch from buying coffee to buying tea. This increase in consumer preference for tea shifts the demand curve for tea to the right. With an unchanged supply, the increased demand creates a situation of temporary shortage at the original price, causing buyers to bid the price up to a new, higher equilibrium.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. decrease in the demand for tea**\nA decrease in the demand for tea would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in its price. A decrease in demand, represented by a leftward shift of the demand curve, means that at any given price, consumers are willing and able to buy less tea. This could be due to factors like a change in consumer tastes or a fall in income. With less demand, sellers will find they have a surplus of tea and will need to lower the price to encourage sales and reach a new, lower equilibrium price.\n\n**B. decrease in the price of a substitute good**\nA decrease in the price of a substitute good would cause the demand for tea to fall, resulting in a lower price for tea. If a substitute like coffee becomes cheaper, consumers will be more likely to buy coffee instead of tea. This reduces the demand for tea, shifting its demand curve to the left. As explained above, a leftward shift in the demand curve leads to a lower equilibrium price.\n\n**D. increase in the supply of tea**\nAn increase in the supply of tea would cause its price to decrease. An increase in supply, represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve, means that producers are willing and able to sell more tea at any given price. This could be caused by factors such as a particularly good harvest, lower production costs, or improved technology. When more tea is available on the market while demand remains constant, a surplus occurs at the original price. To sell the excess stock, producers must lower the price, leading to a new, lower equilibrium price."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_157.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "7 a firm changes the price of its product and finds that its revenue increases.\nwhich combination of price change and price elasticity of demand would have caused this?\n; price elasticity\n\n| | piige of demand\na falls between 0 and 1\nb falls equal to 1\ncc rises between 0 and 1\nd rises greater than 1", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe relationship between a price change and a firm's total revenue is determined by the price elasticity of demand (PED).

This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.\n\nIn this case, if a firm raises its price, the quantity demanded will fall, but by a proportionally smaller amount.

As a result, total revenue would fall, not increase.\n\n**B:** If demand is unitary elastic (PED is equal to 1), the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price.

Economic decisions are made by private individuals and firms based on supply and demand.\n\nThe setting of a minimum wage is a direct form of government intervention in the labour market. It establishes a price floor for labour, meaning that the wage rate is fixed by an external authority rather than being determined by the equilibrium of labour supply and labour demand. This action contradicts the fundamental principle of a market economy, where prices (including wages) are meant to be flexible and determined by market forces. Therefore, government-set minimum wages would not occur in a pure market system.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a monopolist supplying specialist goods to the market**\nWhile perfect competition is an ideal, market failures such as the emergence of monopolies can occur in a market system. A monopoly can arise naturally if a single firm owns a key resource, holds a patent, or benefits from significant economies of scale, allowing it to dominate the market. The existence of a privately-owned monopolist, while inefficient, is not inconsistent with the principles of a market system itself.\n\n**B: excessive pollution created by power stations**\nPollution is a negative externality, which is a cost imposed on a third party who is not directly involved in a transaction. In a market system, firms aim to minimise their private costs of production to maximise profits. They have no natural incentive to consider the external social costs, such as pollution. Consequently, negative externalities are a common form of market failure and are a likely outcome in an unregulated market economy.\n\n**D: private ownership of firms making defence equipment**\nA core principle of a market economy is the private ownership of the factors of production and firms. While defence is often considered a public good that governments provide, the production of defence equipment can be, and often is, carried out by privately-owned firms operating to make a profit.

The primary reason for this is **information failure**, where consumers do not possess or do not fully appreciate the long-term negative consequences (private costs) of consuming the good. For example, individuals may be unaware of or may underestimate the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes or consuming excessive amounts of sugar. Consequently, the good is more harmful to the consumer than they realise, leading them to demand more of it than is individually or socially optimal.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a good which generates external benefits**\nThis statement describes a **merit good**. External benefits, or positive externalities, are benefits that spill over to third parties not directly involved in the consumption of the good. For instance, vaccination provides an external benefit by reducing the spread of disease to others. Demerit goods are typically associated with the opposite: external costs (negative externalities), such as the harm caused by second-hand smoke.\n\n**B: a good with higher private costs than social costs**\nThis statement is incorrect. The relationship between these costs is defined as: **Social Cost = Private Cost + External Cost**. For private costs to be higher than social costs, the external cost would have to be negative, which is equivalent to an external benefit. This is characteristic of a merit good. For a demerit good, the social costs are typically **higher** than the private costs because of the negative externalities (external costs) they generate. For example, the social cost of alcohol consumption includes the private cost to the drinker plus the external costs of drink-driving accidents and strain on public health services.\n\n**D: a good which provides no costs to third parties**\nThis statement describes a good with no negative externalities. \"Costs to third parties\" are the definition of negative externalities. Demerit goods are classic examples of goods that **do** impose costs on third parties. For example, the consumption of alcohol can lead to anti-social behaviour and accidents that harm others, while smoking creates second-hand smoke that is harmful to non-smokers. Therefore, demerit goods are almost always associated with costs to third parties."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_160.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "10 within the same firm, one employee is paid a higher wage than another employee.\nwhich reason for the difference in their wage could be considered discrimination?\na they are of different ages.\nb_ they have different levels of education.\nc_ they have different levels of productivity.\nd_ they have different levels of work experience.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nWage discrimination occurs when workers are paid different wages for the same work based on non-economic factors such as age, gender, or race, rather than differences in productivity or skills. Paying employees differently solely because they are of different ages is a form of age discrimination, which is illegal in many countries. While age can sometimes correlate with experience, using age itself as the reason for a pay difference, especially if the employees have comparable skills and productivity, is considered discriminatory.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. They have different levels of education.**\nA difference in the level of education is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for a wage differential. Education is a form of human capital. Employees with higher or more specialised qualifications are often more skilled and productive, or possess knowledge that is in shorter supply, making them more valuable to a firm. Therefore, it is standard practice to reward higher educational attainment with a higher wage.\n\n**C. They have different levels of productivity.**\nDifferences in productivity are a primary economic justification for wage differentials. According to the marginal revenue product (MRP) theory of wages, a firm is willing to pay a worker a wage up to the value of the additional revenue that worker generates. An employee who is more productive contributes more to the firm's output and revenue, and it is rational for the firm to pay them a higher wage. This is not discrimination but a reflection of the worker's economic contribution.\n\n**D. They have different levels of work experience.**\nWork experience is a key component of a worker's human capital. More experienced employees have often developed greater skills, efficiency, and problem-solving abilities over time. They may require less supervision and can be more productive than less experienced colleagues.

The problem states that the total harvest increased by 25%. Therefore, total production has increased.\n\nLabour productivity is a measure of output per worker. It is calculated by dividing the total output by the number of workers. In this scenario, the total output (the numerator) increased by 25%, while the number of workers (the denominator) decreased by 50%. When output rises and the amount of labour used to create that output falls, the output per worker (labour productivity) must increase.\n\nFor example, assume initially there were 100 workers producing 100 units of harvest. Labour productivity would be 1 unit per worker (100 units / 100 workers). After the changes, there are 50 workers (a 50% reduction) producing 125 units of harvest (a 25% increase). The new labour productivity is 2.5 units per worker (125 units / 50 workers).

The scenario describes a merger with a retailer, which is a later stage, not an earlier one.\n\n**B. conglomerate**\nA conglomerate merger is the joining of two or more firms that operate in entirely different and unrelated industries.

Barriers to entry, which are obstacles preventing new firms from entering the market, must increase. In a competitive market, barriers are low, allowing many firms to operate. For a monopoly to exist, significant barriers\u2014such as patents, control over essential resources, government regulations, or substantial economies of scale\u2014must be present to prevent competition.\n\nSecondly, the single firm operating as a monopoly will produce a much larger output than any of the individual firms in the previous competitive market. This larger scale of production allows the monopolist to benefit from economies of scale, where the average cost per unit of production falls as output increases.\n\nFinally, the size of the firm itself will increase. A competitive market is characterised by many small firms. A monopoly consists of a single, dominant firm that constitutes the entire industry. Therefore, the transition involves the replacement of numerous small firms with one large firm.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because for a monopoly to be established and sustained, barriers to entry must increase, not decrease. Low or decreasing barriers would encourage new firms to enter the market, eroding the monopoly's power. Furthermore, as the firm's size and scale of production increase, it is more likely to experience increasing, not decreasing, economies of scale.\n\n**B:** This option incorrectly states that barriers to entry will decrease and the size of the firm will decrease. A monopoly is defined by high barriers to entry, which is an increase from the low barriers of a competitive market. The monopolist firm is, by definition, large as it serves the entire market, which is an increase in size compared to the small firms in a competitive structure.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because both economies of scale and the size of the firm are likely to increase, not decrease. A monopolist's ability to produce for the entire market leads to a larger firm size and greater potential for economies of scale. Decreasing economies of scale (diseconomies of scale) would imply that the firm becomes less efficient as it grows, which would make it vulnerable to competition and less likely to sustain a monopoly."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_167.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "17 which macroeconomic aim, if achieved, is most likely to increase a government budget surplus?\na full employment\nb income redistribution\nc low inflation\nd balance of payments stability", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation**\n\nA government budget surplus occurs when total government revenue exceeds total government expenditure. Achieving full employment is the macroeconomic aim most likely to cause this to happen for two primary reasons:\n\n1.  **Increased Government Revenue:** When an economy is at or near full employment, a larger proportion of the population is in paid work. This leads to a significant increase in government revenue from direct taxes, such as income tax, and social security contributions. Furthermore, higher employment levels boost aggregate demand, leading to increased consumer spending and higher corporate profits. This, in turn, increases government revenue from indirect taxes (like VAT or sales tax) and corporation tax.\n\n2.  **Decreased Government Expenditure:** A major component of government spending is transfer payments, particularly unemployment benefits. At full employment, the number of people claiming these benefits falls to a minimum. This substantial reduction in government expenditure, combined with the increase in tax revenue, makes a budget surplus more likely.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. income redistribution**\nPolicies for income redistribution typically involve using progressive taxation (taxing higher incomes at a higher rate) to fund increased welfare payments and benefits for those on lower incomes. While this increases tax revenue from some groups, it also directly increases government expenditure on transfer payments. The net effect on the government budget is uncertain and depends on the scale of the policies; it does not inherently lead to a surplus and could even increase a deficit.\n\n**C. low inflation**\nWhile low and stable inflation is a key macroeconomic objective, its impact on the budget surplus is not as direct or significant as full employment. Low inflation can mean that nominal tax revenues grow more slowly. At the same time, it can also slow the growth of government expenditure on items like public sector wages and inflation-indexed state pensions. The overall effect is ambiguous and does not guarantee an increase in the budget surplus.\n\n**D. balance of payments stability**\nThe balance of payments records a country's financial transactions with the rest of the world.

A progressive tax system is one where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. The changes from Year 1 to Year 2 involve decreasing the tax rates for lower-income bands (from 10% to 0% for the $5000-9999 band, and from 20% to 10% for the $10000-19999 band) while increasing the tax rates for higher-income bands (from 40% to 50% for the $30000-49999 band, and from 40% to 60% for the $50000+ band).\n\nThis shift in the tax burden, taking a smaller proportion of income from the poor and a larger proportion from the rich, leads to a redistribution of income. By increasing the disposable income of low-earners and decreasing that of high-earners, the government narrows the gap in after-tax income. This is a direct fiscal policy measure aimed at reducing income inequality.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. to reduce a current account deficit**\n\nTo reduce a current account deficit, a government typically aims to reduce aggregate demand, thereby lowering demand for imports. This is usually achieved through contractionary fiscal policy, such as a general increase in taxes to reduce disposable income and consumption across the economy. The policy shown is not purely contractionary; it cuts taxes for lower-income groups, which would likely increase their consumption and potentially increase demand for imports, working against the objective of reducing a current account deficit.\n\n**C. to reduce inflation**\n\nReducing inflation requires contractionary fiscal policy to lower aggregate demand. This involves increasing taxes or cutting government spending. While the tax increases on higher-income earners would reduce their spending, the tax cuts for lower-income earners would have the opposite effect. Lower-income households tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC), meaning they are likely to spend a larger proportion of any additional income. Therefore, cutting their taxes could lead to a net increase in overall consumption and aggregate demand, which would likely worsen inflationary pressures rather than reduce them.\n\n**D. to reduce structural unemployment**\n\nStructural unemployment is caused by a mismatch between the skills held by the workforce and the skills demanded by employers. It is typically addressed through supply-side policies, such as government-funded education and training programs, or policies to improve the geographical mobility of labour. Changes in income tax rates are a tool of fiscal policy and do not directly address the underlying skills gap that causes structural unemployment."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_169.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "19 a government attempts to raise economic growth with a policy of reduced interest rates.\nwhich other government objective is most likely to be helped in the short run?\na lower unemployment\nb _ price stability\nc_ reduced income inequality\nd_ reduced trade deficit", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA policy of reduced interest rates is an example of expansionary monetary policy. Lowering interest rates makes it cheaper for consumers to borrow for major purchases and less attractive to save, thereby stimulating consumption. It also makes it cheaper for firms to borrow to fund investment in new capital. This combined increase in consumption and investment leads to a rise in aggregate demand, which in turn stimulates economic growth (an increase in real GDP).\n\nTo produce this higher level of output, firms will need to hire more labour. This increase in the demand for labour leads to a reduction in cyclical unemployment. Therefore, a policy designed to raise economic growth is very likely to also help achieve the objective of lower unemployment in the short run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: price stability**\n\nThis is incorrect. A policy of reduced interest rates increases aggregate demand. When aggregate demand in an economy rises, it puts upward pressure on the general price level, leading to demand-pull inflation. This moves the economy away from the objective of price stability (which is typically defined as a low and stable rate of inflation). There is often a short-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation; policies that lower unemployment tend to increase inflation.\n\n**C: reduced income inequality**\n\nThis is incorrect because the effect of lower interest rates on income inequality is uncertain and not a direct outcome. While lower unemployment may help reduce inequality by providing more people with an income, other effects can work in the opposite direction. For instance, lower interest rates can lead to an increase in the value of assets such as property and shares. Since these assets are disproportionately owned by wealthier households, this can increase wealth inequality, which is closely linked to income inequality. The net effect is not clear, and it is certainly not the most likely objective to be helped.\n\n**D: reduced trade deficit**\n\nThis is incorrect because the effect on the trade deficit is ambiguous. On one hand, lower interest rates can lead to a depreciation of the country's exchange rate. This would make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which could help to reduce a trade deficit. On the other hand, the policy is designed to increase economic growth, which raises national income. As incomes rise, consumers and firms tend to spend more on all goods and services, including imports. This increase in spending on imports could worsen the trade deficit. Because these two effects work in opposite directions, the overall outcome is uncertain."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_170.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is the definition of a supply-side policy?\na any policy designed to decrease inflation\nb_ any policy designed to decrease unemployment\nc any policy designed to increase imports\ndany policy designed to increase productivity", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: D**\n\nA supply-side policy is a government action designed to increase the productive potential and efficiency of an economy. This is achieved by improving the quantity or quality of the factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise). Increasing productivity\u2014the measure of output per unit of input\u2014is the central mechanism through which these policies work. For example, policies such as investment in education and training improve the skills of the workforce (human capital), while deregulation can foster competition and innovation. Both lead to firms being able to produce more goods and services with the same or fewer resources, thereby increasing the economy's aggregate supply.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: any policy designed to decrease inflation**\nWhile a successful supply-side policy can lead to lower inflation, this is an outcome, not the definition. Supply-side policies increase the economy's ability to produce goods and services (shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right). If aggregate demand does not increase as quickly, this can reduce pressure on the general price level. However, policies specifically designed to combat inflation are often demand-side policies, such as increasing interest rates (monetary policy) to reduce aggregate demand.\n\n**B: any policy designed to decrease unemployment**\nSimilar to inflation, a reduction in unemployment can be a positive consequence of supply-side policies, but it is not their defining feature. Supply-side policies can reduce structural unemployment by improving labour market flexibility and skills. However, demand-side policies (e.g., expansionary fiscal policy) are also used to reduce unemployment, specifically cyclical unemployment. The core purpose of a supply-side policy is to enhance the productive capacity of the economy, not just to target unemployment.\n\n**C: any policy designed to increase imports**\nThe objective of a supply-side policy is to strengthen the domestic economy's productive capacity. A policy specifically designed to increase imports does not achieve this; in fact, it may indicate a reliance on foreign production. Successful supply-side policies often make domestic firms more competitive, which can lead to a rise in exports and a potential decrease in imports as consumers switch to more competitive, domestically-produced goods."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_171.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "21 subsistence farming is the practice of growing crops and raising livestock sufficient only for one\u2019s\nown use without any surplus for trade.\nwhy is it difficult for a government to measure economic growth in an economy based on subsistence\nfarming?\na farmers\u2019 families consume most of their own produce.\nb_ farmers have low rates of saving.\nc_ the size of harvest is dependent on the weather.\nd_ the surplus produce is sold to the government.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nEconomic growth is typically measured by the change in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a specific period. For a good or service to be included in GDP calculations, it must typically be part of a market transaction, which gives it a recorded monetary value. In a subsistence economy, farmers produce food primarily for their own family's consumption. As this produce is not sold in a market, it has no official price or recorded value. This large, unrecorded portion of economic production is often referred to as the 'hidden' or 'informal' economy. Because a significant amount of economic activity is not captured in official statistics, it becomes extremely difficult for a government to accurately measure the true level of national output and, consequently, its rate of growth.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Farmers have low rates of saving.**\nWhile it is often true that subsistence farmers have low rates of saving due to low income levels, this affects the potential for future economic growth (through lack of investment) rather than the *measurement* of current economic growth. The difficulty in measurement stems from the nature of the production, not the financial habits of the producers.\n\n**C. The size of harvest is dependent on the weather.**\nThe output of virtually all agriculture, including large-scale commercial farming, is dependent on the weather. This can cause fluctuations in output from year to year, but it does not, by itself, make the output immeasurable. The output from commercial farms is sold on the market and is therefore recorded in national accounts. The key measurement challenge in subsistence farming is the lack of market transactions, not the volatility of production.\n\n**D. The surplus produce is sold to the government.**\nThis statement contradicts the definition of subsistence farming provided in the question, which is \"growing crops and raising livestock sufficient only for one's own use without any surplus for trade.\" The core principle of subsistence farming is the absence of a surplus for sale. If a surplus were produced and sold (to the government or anyone else), that transaction would have a monetary value and could be measured and included in GDP.

These criteria are used to distinguish the unemployed from those who are employed and those who are economically inactive (not in the labour force).\n\n1.  **The worker does not have a paid job:** This is the most fundamental condition. An individual must be without paid employment or self-employment to be considered unemployed. All four options correctly identify this as a necessary condition.\n\n2.  **The worker is prepared to work:** This condition is crucial. It means the individual is both available for work and is actively seeking a job. A person who does not have a job but is not prepared to work (e.g., a full-time student, a retiree, or someone caring for family) is not considered unemployed. Instead, they are classified as economically inactive because they are not part of the labour force. This eliminates options A and B, which state the worker is not prepared to work.\n\n3.  **The worker will accept the current wage rate:** This condition specifies that the individual is willing to work for the wages currently being offered in the market for their skills and experience. This is the standard assumption for defining involuntary unemployment, where people are jobless because of a lack of available positions, not because they are holding out for an unrealistically high wage. Option D includes this condition, representing a worker who is ready and willing to take a job at the going rate but cannot find one.\n\n**Incorrect Options Analysis:**\n\n*   **Option A and B:** These are incorrect because they state that the worker is not prepared to work.

While such a person (jobless and seeking work, but only at a higher wage) does exist and contributes to frictional unemployment, the standard, general definition of an unemployed person for statistical purposes includes the willingness to work at prevailing wages. This describes involuntary unemployment, which is the primary concern of macroeconomic policy.

The cost of updating price lists is known as a 'menu cost'. When the rate of inflation increases, the general price level in an economy rises more rapidly. To maintain their real profit margins, firms must adjust their own prices more frequently to keep pace with their rising costs. The process of changing prices\u2014such as reprinting menus and catalogues, updating websites, and re-labelling products on shelves\u2014incurs real resource costs. Therefore, an increase in the inflation rate from 2% to 8% will necessitate more frequent price changes, leading to an increase in these menu costs.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. the level of business confidence**\n\nAn increase in the rate of inflation, particularly a sharp one from 2% to 8%, typically leads to a *decrease*, not an increase, in business confidence. High and accelerating inflation creates economic uncertainty. It becomes more difficult for firms to forecast their future costs (e.g., raw materials, wages) and revenues. This uncertainty can deter investment and long-term planning, thereby reducing the overall level of confidence businesses have in the economic outlook.\n\n**C. the real income of fixed-income earners**\n\nReal income is nominal income adjusted for the effects of inflation; it reflects purchasing power. Fixed-income earners, such as pensioners or those on long-term salary contracts, receive a nominal income that does not change. When the rate of inflation increases from 2% to 8%, the purchasing power of their fixed income erodes at a much faster rate. Consequently, their real income will *decrease*, not increase.\n\n**D. the real value of consumer debt**\n\nThe real value of debt refers to the purchasing power of the money owed. Inflation erodes the value of money. When inflation is higher than anticipated, the money that debtors use to repay their loans is worth less than the money they originally borrowed. An increase in the inflation rate from 2% to 8% means the value of money is falling more quickly. For a consumer with a debt of a fixed nominal amount (e.g., a mortgage or a personal loan), this faster erosion of money's value causes the real value, or burden, of their debt to *decrease*."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_174.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "24 the introduction of a minimum hourly wage in an industry aims to reduce poverty among low-paid\nworkers.\nwhat is an advantage to workers of an effective national minimum wage?\na_ all workers get paid according to their level of productivity.\nb_ firms may look to increase capital equipment rather than labour.\nc_ levels of employment become more dependent on wage differences.\nd_ redistribution of a firm\u2019s income rewards labour rather than owners.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn effective national minimum wage is set above the free-market equilibrium wage rate. This action increases the cost of labour for firms employing low-wage workers. This additional wage expense must be covered by the firm's revenue. Consequently, a smaller portion of the firm's income is available for profits, which are the reward to the firm's owners. In this way, the minimum wage forces a redistribution of income from the owners of capital to low-paid labour. For the workers who keep their jobs and receive the higher wage, this increase in their share of the firm's income is a significant advantage.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** In a free market, wages are often closely linked to a worker's productivity. However, a minimum wage is a price floor that mandates a certain level of pay, irrespective of an individual's productivity. For workers whose productivity might otherwise command a wage below the minimum, the minimum wage decouples their pay from their productivity level. Therefore, it does not ensure all workers are paid according to their level of productivity; rather, it ensures a minimum standard of pay.\n\n**B:** An increase in the cost of labour, caused by a minimum wage, makes capital (such as machinery and technology) a relatively cheaper factor of production. This incentivises firms to substitute capital for labour to minimise their production costs. While this may increase the firm's efficiency, it can lead to a decrease in the demand for low-skilled workers and potentially cause unemployment. This is a well-documented potential *disadvantage* of a minimum wage for workers, not an advantage.\n\n**C:** A national minimum wage establishes a single wage floor, effectively standardising the lowest possible wage across many different jobs and industries. This action *reduces* the wage differences at the lower end of the pay scale, as many different jobs that might have paid slightly different wages will now all pay at least the minimum.

Firms within these specialised industries produce for a much larger market, including both domestic consumers and consumers in other countries (the export market). This significant increase in the scale of production allows firms to benefit from economies of scale. Economies of scale are the cost advantages that arise from increased output, leading to a fall in the average cost per unit. For example, a firm can buy raw materials in bulk at a discount, use larger and more efficient machinery, and spread fixed costs (like marketing or research) over a greater number of units. These lower average costs increase the firm's profit margins and enhance its competitiveness in the global market.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. dependency on supplies from other countries:** This is a potential disadvantage, not an advantage, of national specialisation. When a country specialises, it reduces or ceases production of other goods and services. Consequently, it must rely on imports from other nations to satisfy domestic demand for these items. This dependency can make the economy vulnerable to disruptions in global supply chains, trade disputes, or price volatility in international markets.\n\n**B. greater competition from overseas firms:** While specialisation allows a country's firms to compete internationally, it also means the country will import goods from other nations that specialise in different products. This opens the domestic market to foreign competition. For a domestic firm, especially one not in a specialised export industry, this increased competition from overseas firms is a significant challenge or disadvantage, as it can reduce market share and put downward pressure on prices and profits.\n\n**C. greater depletion of the country's natural resources:** This is a potential disadvantage of specialisation, particularly for countries whose comparative advantage is based on primary products. If a country specialises in the production of goods that require intensive use of non-renewable resources (e.g., oil, minerals, timber), the increased scale of production for export can lead to the rapid and unsustainable depletion of these resources.

By implementing protectionist measures such as tariffs or quotas, the government makes imported goods more expensive or less available.

The fundamental purpose of protecting infant industries is to give them a grace period to develop economies of scale, improve their technology, and gain experience. The long-term goal is for these firms to become efficient and strong enough to compete with, and even outperform, foreign firms on the global stage. Therefore, the policy intends to *increase*, not decrease, their competitiveness. While a potential negative consequence of long-term protection can be a lack of innovation and reduced competitiveness, this is an unintended and undesirable result, not the policy's objective.\n\n**B. to decrease the demand for exported goods**\nThe policy of protecting infant industries is primarily focused on the domestic market, aiming to substitute imported goods with domestically produced ones. It is not intended to affect the country's exports negatively. In fact, the long-term ambition is that once the infant industry matures and becomes competitive, it will begin to export its goods, thereby *increasing* the demand for the country's exports. A decrease in demand for exported goods could be an unintended consequence if other countries retaliate with their own trade barriers, but it is not the intended outcome.\n\n**D. to increase the supply of imported goods**\nThis is contrary to the mechanism of the policy. Protecting domestic industries involves implementing trade barriers like tariffs (taxes on imports) or quotas (limits on the quantity of imports). These measures are specifically designed to *reduce* the supply and/or increase the price of imported goods in the domestic market.

Human desires for goods, services, and experiences are considered to be insatiable; as soon as one want is satisfied, new ones emerge. For example, once a person has basic food and shelter, they may want better food, a larger house, a car, holidays abroad, and so on. Because the resources available to produce these goods and services\u2014such as land, labour, and capital\u2014are limited, it is impossible to satisfy every want for every person. This fundamental imbalance ensures that scarcity will always exist, forcing individuals, businesses, and governments to make choices about how to allocate their limited resources.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: There are high costs of production.**\nWhile high production costs can limit the supply of certain goods and make them less accessible, they are a symptom or consequence of scarcity, not its fundamental cause. Costs of production are high precisely because the resources (labour, raw materials, capital) used in production are scarce and have alternative uses. If resources were not scarce, they would have no cost. Therefore, scarcity causes costs, not the other way around.\n\n**B: There are low levels of education.**\nLow levels of education can lead to lower productivity and less efficient use of resources, which can worsen the effects of scarcity. However, scarcity is not caused by a lack of education. Even a highly educated and technologically advanced society, which can produce goods and services more efficiently, still faces the basic problem of unlimited wants and limited resources. Education is a means of managing scarcity more effectively, but it cannot eliminate it.\n\n**C: There are unlimited resources.**\nThis statement is the direct opposite of the condition that creates scarcity. The core concept of scarcity is based on the premise that resources are finite or limited. If resources were unlimited, it would be possible to produce enough goods and services to satisfy everyone's wants, and the problem of scarcity would not exist.

A reduction in the cost of producing the drink will lead to an increase in supply. This is because the firm can now produce more at each price level, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. This shift in supply results in a lower equilibrium market price. The fall in price, in turn, causes consumers to demand a greater quantity, which is described as an extension in demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a period of hot weather**\nHot weather is a non-price factor that increases consumers' preference for a cold fruit drink.

A government-imposed maximum price, or price ceiling, set below the market equilibrium price is a classic cause of disequilibrium. At this lower price, consumers are willing and able to buy more of the good (an increase in quantity demanded), while producers are willing and able to offer less (a decrease in quantity supplied).

The wage rate for cleaners will change because the minimum wage (OM) is a binding price floor set above their equilibrium wage (Wc). The wage rate for nurses will not fall; a minimum wage is a price floor, not a price ceiling, and it is set below the equilibrium wage, making it non-binding and thus having no effect on the market wage.\n\n#### C: rise, fall\n\nThis option is partially correct in that the wage rates of cleaners will rise. However, it is incorrect in stating that the wage rates of nurses will fall. The national minimum wage sets a floor below which wages cannot legally be paid.

Sales tax is an indirect tax added to the price of goods and services. Lowering this tax makes items cheaper for consumers, increasing their purchasing power and providing an incentive to buy more.\n\n**C. lower interest rates**\nLower interest rates would stimulate an *increase* in household spending. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, making it cheaper for households to take out loans for major purchases (like cars or appliances) or spend on credit. Furthermore, lower interest rates decrease the reward for saving, making spending a more attractive option than saving money in a bank.\n\n**D. lower savings**\nLower savings implies an *increase* in spending.

Firstly, communication within a small firm is generally more effective. With fewer employees and a flatter organisational hierarchy, information can be transmitted quickly and with less distortion between management and staff. This facilitates faster decision-making and a more responsive organisational culture. Secondly, small firms, particularly those run by their owners (sole traders, partnerships), enjoy greater independence. The owners have significant control over business decisions and can implement changes without the need for lengthy consultations with a board of directors or shareholders, allowing for greater flexibility and speed in adapting to market changes.\n\nHowever, small firms do not typically have lower average costs. Large firms are able to benefit from economies of scale, which are cost advantages reaped by companies when production becomes efficient. By producing in large volumes, large firms can negotiate bulk discounts on raw materials (purchasing economies), use large-scale, specialised machinery (technical economies), and secure finance at lower interest rates (financial economies). These factors lead to a lower average cost per unit of output for large firms, an advantage that small firms generally cannot match. Therefore, better communication and greater independence are advantages of a small firm, but lower average cost is not.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that small firms do not have better communication or greater independence.

It also incorrectly claims that small firms have lower average costs, which is a characteristic advantage of large firms due to economies of scale.\n\n**B:** This option incorrectly suggests that better communication is not an advantage of a small firm. Due to their simpler structure and fewer layers of management, small firms are widely recognised as having more direct and efficient communication channels than large, bureaucratic organisations.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it claims that lower average cost is an advantage for a small firm. In reality, large firms are more likely to achieve lower average costs through various economies of scale (e.g., bulk buying, specialised capital, access to cheaper finance). Small firms typically operate at a smaller scale of output and thus have higher average costs compared to their larger competitors."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_193.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13 what is a variable cost for a firm?\na the cost of raw materials\nb the interest payment on existing loans\nc_ the rent on the factory\nd the insurance on the factory buildings", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA variable cost is a cost that changes in direct proportion to the level of a firm's output.

If production ceases, the cost of raw materials for production becomes zero.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: the interest payment on existing loans**\nThis is a fixed cost, not a variable cost. A fixed cost is an expense that does not change with the level of output. Interest payments on loans are typically fixed contractual obligations that must be paid at regular intervals, regardless of whether the firm produces many units, few units, or no units at all.\n\n**C: the rent on the factory**\nThis is a fixed cost. Rent is a periodic payment agreed upon in a lease contract for the use of property. The amount of rent due does not depend on the firm's production volume. The firm must pay the rent even if the factory is temporarily shut down and producing nothing.\n\n**D: the insurance on the factory buildings**\nThis is also a fixed cost. Insurance premiums are paid to protect assets like buildings and machinery. The cost of the premium is determined by the value of the asset and the level of risk, not by the quantity of goods being produced. This cost remains constant regardless of the firm's output level."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_194.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 the table shows the daily average revenue and units of output sold for a firm producing bicycles\nover a five day period.\nrevenue ($) | output sold\n\n1 200 2\n\n2 160 4\n\n3 120 8\n\n4 80 14\n\n5 40 16\nwhat can be concluded from the table?\na the firm's highest total revenue occurs at 2 units of output sold.\nb_ the firm's highest total revenue occurs at 14 units of output sold.\nc_ the firm's prices are always greater than total revenue.\nd_ the firm's total revenue always increases as output rises.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo determine the firm's total revenue, we multiply the average revenue by the units of output sold.

As calculated above, the firm achieves a higher total revenue at other output levels, with the maximum being $1120 at 14 units.\n\n**C. The firm's prices are always greater than total revenue.**\nThis is incorrect. In economics, average revenue is equivalent to the price per unit (P = AR). The total revenue is the price multiplied by the quantity sold (TR = P \u00d7 Q). As long as more than one unit is sold, total revenue will be greater than the price. For example, on day 1, the price is $200, while the total revenue is $400. In every case shown in the table, the price (average revenue) is less than the total revenue.\n\n**D. The firm's total revenue always increases as output rises.**\nThis is incorrect. While total revenue does increase as output rises from 2 to 14 units (from $400 to $1120), it then decreases when output rises from 14 to 16 units (from $1120 to $640). Therefore, total revenue does not *always* increase as output rises.

It acts as a yardstick or standard, allowing the value of diverse items to be expressed and compared in a single, understandable monetary unit (e.g., dollars, euros, yen). This simplifies economic calculations, price setting, and the comparison of value between different products, making it synonymous with the term \"measure of value\".\n\n---\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A. a medium of exchange**\nThis function refers to the use of money to facilitate transactions. Money acts as an intermediary that is universally accepted in exchange for goods and services, thereby eliminating the need for a barter system and the \"double coincidence of wants\". While essential for trade, this function is about the process of exchange itself, not the measurement of the value of the items being exchanged.\n\n**B. a standard of deferred payment**\nThis function allows money to be used for transactions that are settled in the future, such as repaying a loan or paying for goods on credit. It establishes a standard for what a future debt is worth. While it relies on money holding its value, its primary role is in facilitating borrowing and lending over time, rather than measuring the value of a good at a specific point in time.\n\n**C. a store of wealth**\nThis function means that money can be saved and will retain its purchasing power over time (assuming low inflation).

These firms are 'price takers', meaning they must accept the prevailing market price, which is determined by the overall forces of supply and demand. Intense competition among sellers forces prices down, often close to the marginal cost of production. In contrast, a monopoly, as the sole producer, is a 'price maker' and can set a higher price to maximise its profits, as consumers have no alternative suppliers.\n\n*   **Profit:** In the long run, firms in a highly competitive market typically earn only normal profit (the minimum profit required to keep the firm in operation). This is due to the absence of significant barriers to entry. If existing firms start making supernormal profits (profits above the normal level), new firms will be attracted to the market. This increases market supply, which drives the price down and erodes the supernormal profits until only normal profit remains. A monopoly, however, is protected by high barriers to entry, which prevent new firms from entering the market. This allows the monopolist to sustain supernormal profits in the long run.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A: higher price, higher profit**\n    This is incorrect. Both price and profit are characteristic of a monopoly, not a competitive market. Competition drives prices down, and the free entry of new firms erodes long-run supernormal profits.\n\n*   **B: higher price, lower profit**\n    This is incorrect. The price in a competitive market is lower, not higher, than in a monopoly. While the profit level is correctly identified as lower, the price comparison is wrong. A market cannot sustain prices that are simultaneously higher than a monopoly's and yield lower profits.\n\n*   **C: lower price, higher profit**\n    This is incorrect. While the price in a competitive market is indeed lower than in a monopoly, the profit is also lower, not higher. The very competitive pressures that lead to lower prices also prevent firms from sustaining high, long-run supernormal profits, which are a key feature of monopolies."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_197.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "17 what is not a role of central government in a mixed economy?\na providing demerit goods\nb providing merit goods\nc providing public goods\nd - stabilising the economy", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nA demerit good is a product or service whose consumption is considered harmful to the individual and society, often generating negative externalities. Examples include tobacco, alcohol, and addictive drugs. In a mixed economy, the role of the central government is to correct market failure associated with these goods. Since a free market tends to over-produce and over-consume demerit goods, the government's objective is to *reduce* their consumption. It achieves this through policies such as imposing high taxes (excise duties), implementing regulations (e.g., age restrictions, advertising bans), or making the good illegal. Therefore, providing demerit goods is the opposite of the government's actual role.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: providing merit goods**\nThis is a key role of the government in a mixed economy. Merit goods, such as education and healthcare, are beneficial for both the individual and society (they have positive externalities) but would be under-consumed if left to the free market. Individuals may not be able to afford them or may not fully recognise their long-term benefits. To correct this market failure, the government often provides merit goods directly (e.g., state schools) or subsidises their provision to increase consumption.\n\n**C: providing public goods**\nThis is a fundamental role of the government. Public goods, like national defence or street lighting, are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means it is impossible to prevent someone from benefiting from them (even if they don't pay), and one person's use does not diminish their availability to others. Due to the \"free-rider problem,\" private firms have no incentive to provide public goods as they cannot charge for them and make a profit. Consequently, the government must provide them and fund them through taxation.\n\n**D: stabilising the economy**\nThis is a primary macroeconomic function of the central government in a mixed economy. The government uses fiscal policy (adjusting government spending and taxation) and works alongside the central bank's monetary policy to manage the business cycle.

This combination of policies achieves that goal effectively.\n\n*   **Reduce interest rate:** This is an expansionary monetary policy. Lowering the interest rate makes borrowing cheaper for consumers and firms. This encourages increased spending on goods and services (consumption) and increased spending on capital goods (investment). Both consumption and investment are key components of aggregate demand, so a reduction in the interest rate helps to stimulate the economy and push prices upwards.\n*   **Increase government spending:** This is an expansionary fiscal policy. When the government increases its spending on areas like infrastructure, education, or healthcare, it directly injects money into the economy. This represents a direct increase in aggregate demand (as G is a component of AD = C + I + G + (X-M)).\n\nCombining these two policies creates a powerful, coordinated effort to boost total spending in the economy, thereby counteracting deflationary pressures.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Increase interest rate, increase government spending:**\nThis combination involves contradictory policies. Increasing the interest rate is a contractionary monetary policy aimed at reducing aggregate demand to control inflation. It discourages borrowing and spending. Conversely, increasing government spending is an expansionary fiscal policy. Because the two policies work in opposite directions, their combined effect would be less effective at preventing deflation than a coordinated expansionary approach.\n\n**B) Increase interest rate, reduce government spending:**\nThis combination represents a strong contractionary stance. Both increasing the interest rate (contractionary monetary policy) and reducing government spending (contractionary fiscal policy) are designed to decrease aggregate demand. This would be an appropriate strategy to combat high inflation, but it is the opposite of what is needed to prevent deflation. Implementing these policies would likely worsen deflationary pressures.\n\n**D) Reduce interest rate, reduce government spending:**\nThis combination involves contradictory policies. Reducing the interest rate is an expansionary monetary policy designed to stimulate spending.

Before the tax, producers received price P\u2081. After the tax, the price consumers pay is P\u2082, but the producer must remit the tax to the government. The amount the producer receives per unit is P\u2082 minus the tax, which is price H.

They focus on increasing the quantity and quality of the factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise) and improving the efficiency of markets. This leads to an increase in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS), which represents the economy's maximum potential output. Examples include investment in education and training, privatisation, deregulation, and tax incentives for investment.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B:** Policies that aim to increase total demand (aggregate demand) are known as demand-side policies. These include fiscal policy (changes in government spending and taxation) and monetary policy (changes in the interest rate and money supply). While some supply-side measures, like income tax cuts, may also boost demand, their primary objective is to improve incentives to work and produce, thus boosting aggregate supply.\n\n**C:** Changes in the equilibrium foreign exchange rate are typically managed through exchange rate policy or are an outcome of monetary policy.

It is driven by an increase in the quantity or quality of the factors of production, which include labour. An increase in the retirement age means that people must work for longer before they are eligible to retire. This has the immediate effect of increasing the size of the labour force, as workers who would have otherwise retired remain in employment. A larger labour force increases the productive capacity of the economy, allowing it to produce more goods and services. This leads to a higher rate of economic growth in the short run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an increase in net emigration**\nNet emigration occurs when more people leave a country to live elsewhere than people who arrive to live in the country. This leads to a decrease in the total population. A significant portion of emigrants are typically of working age. Therefore, an increase in net emigration would reduce the size of the labour force, decreasing the country's productive capacity and leading to slower, not faster, economic growth.\n\n**B. an increase in the birth rate**\nAn increase in the birth rate means more children are being born. In the short run, this increases the number of dependents in the population without adding to the labour force. New-borns will not be able to contribute to the production of goods and services for at least 16-18 years. While a higher birth rate may lead to a larger workforce and potentially faster growth in the long run, it does not cause faster economic growth in the short run.\n\n**C. an increase in the death rate**\nAn increase in the death rate means that a larger proportion of the population is dying. This reduces the overall population size and, consequently, the size of the labour force. A smaller labour force reduces an economy's capacity to produce goods and services, which would slow down or reverse economic growth rather than accelerate it."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_202.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "22 how is the pattern of employment likely to change when a country becomes more developed?\na __ from rural employment to urban employment\nb_ from skilled employment to primary employment\nc_ from technical employment to manual employment\nd from tertiary employment to secondary employment", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nEconomic development involves a structural transformation of an economy. In less developed countries, the economy is typically dominated by the primary sector, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Consequently, a large proportion of the workforce is engaged in rural employment. As a country develops, it undergoes industrialisation (growth of the secondary sector) and later, a significant expansion of the tertiary (service) sector. Both industries and services are predominantly located in towns and cities. This creates a \"pull\" factor, as new and often better-paid job opportunities in urban areas attract labour from rural areas. This migration from the countryside to cities, known as urbanisation, leads to a fundamental shift in the pattern of employment from rural-based to urban-based.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. from skilled employment to primary employment**\n\nThis statement describes the opposite of what occurs during economic development. Primary sector employment (e.g., farming, mining) is characteristic of less developed economies and often involves lower-skilled or traditional forms of labour. As an economy develops, there is a shift *away* from the primary sector towards the secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (services) sectors. These sectors typically require a more educated and skilled workforce. Therefore, the pattern of employment changes from primary-dominant and lower-skilled towards more skilled employment in other sectors.\n\n**C. from technical employment to manual employment**\n\nThis is incorrect. Economic development is strongly associated with technological advancement and innovation. As industries and services become more sophisticated, the demand for workers with technical skills, education, and specialised training increases. The demand for purely manual labour, while important in early stages of industrialisation, tends to decrease as a proportion of the total workforce due to automation and the growth of the knowledge-based service sector. The overall trend is a shift from manual to technical and skilled employment.\n\n**D. from tertiary employment to secondary employment**\n\nThis represents a reversal of the typical path of economic development. The established pattern of structural change is a progression from an economy dominated by the primary sector, to one dominated by the secondary sector, and finally to one where the tertiary (service) sector is the largest employer. Highly developed countries are characterised by large and growing service sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, education, IT).

Assuming other factors remain constant, an increase in the number of births will directly lead to a higher population growth rate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. death rate**\nThe death rate is the number of deaths per 1,000 people in a population per year. A rise in the death rate means that more people are being removed from the population. This would cause the population growth rate to slow down or even become negative (a population decline), not increase.\n\n**C. infant mortality rate**\nThe infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 live births. This is a component of the overall death rate. A rise in the infant mortality rate contributes to a higher overall death rate. As explained above, an increase in the death rate leads to a decrease, not an increase, in the population growth rate.\n\n**D. net emigration**\nNet emigration occurs when more people leave a country (emigration) than enter it (immigration). A rise in net emigration means the net outflow of people from the country is increasing.

The demand for the good is not directly affected by the imposition of a tariff, so the demand curve remains at D. The new market equilibrium is found at the intersection of the new supply curve (S\u2081) and the original demand curve (D). This corresponds to point B, where the price is higher and the quantity traded is lower than at the original equilibrium (X).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** Point A represents the intersection of a new, lower demand curve (D\u2081) and a new, lower supply curve (S\u2081). While the shift in the supply curve from S to S\u2081 correctly reflects the impact of a tariff, a tariff does not cause the demand curve itself to shift. It causes a movement along the demand curve due to the price change.

To undertake FDI in China, foreign investors must first purchase Chinese yuan (\u00a5) using their own currency. This act of purchasing yuan creates demand for the currency on the foreign exchange market. Therefore, a decrease in the level of FDI flowing into China means that fewer foreign investors are seeking to buy yuan. This reduction in the desire to purchase yuan leads to a decrease in the overall demand for the currency, causing the demand curve to shift to the left from D\u2081 to D\u2082.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. a decrease in the level of tariffs levied by China on imports**\nA decrease in tariffs on imported goods makes them cheaper for Chinese consumers and firms. This would likely increase the quantity of imports demanded by China. To pay for these foreign goods, Chinese importers need to sell yuan and buy foreign currency (e.g., US dollars). This action increases the *supply* of yuan on the foreign exchange market, which would be represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve (S\u2081), not a shift in the demand curve.\n\n**C. an increase in the buying of yuan by central banks**\nWhen central banks (either China's or those of other countries) buy a currency on the foreign exchange market, it constitutes an increase in the demand for that currency. An increase in the buying of yuan would therefore lead to a rise in demand, causing the demand curve to shift to the right (e.g., from D\u2082 to D\u2081).

This change has significant effects on international trade. A weaker pound makes UK exports cheaper for foreign buyers, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded for UK exports. Conversely, it makes imports from the US and other countries more expensive for UK consumers and firms, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded for imports. The combined effect of rising export revenue and falling import expenditure is an improvement in the UK's current account balance. Therefore, an existing current account deficit is likely to decrease.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: decreased cost-push inflation**\nThis is incorrect. A depreciation of the pound increases the price of imported goods, including raw materials, components, and finished goods. When firms that rely on these imports see their costs of production rise, they may pass these higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This phenomenon is known as cost-push inflation. Therefore, a depreciation of the pound is more likely to *increase* cost-push inflation, not decrease it.\n\n**C: increased quantity of imports**\nThis is incorrect. A depreciation of the pound means that more pounds are needed to buy the same amount of US dollars. Consequently, goods and services imported from the US (and other countries) become more expensive for UK consumers and businesses. According to the law of demand, an increase in the price of imported goods will lead to a fall in the quantity demanded. Therefore, a depreciation is likely to cause a *decrease* in the quantity of imports.\n\n**D: increased trade deficit**\nThis is incorrect. A trade deficit occurs when the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports. A depreciation of the pound makes UK exports cheaper and more competitive abroad, while making imports more expensive. This is expected to increase the volume (and likely the value) of exports and decrease the volume (and likely the value) of imports.

Scarcity exists because there is a conflict between the finite, or limited, resources available and the infinite, or unlimited, wants of society. Resources, also known as factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise), are the inputs used to create goods and services. However, human desires for these goods and services are endless. Consequently, societies cannot produce everything that everyone wants. This forces economic agents\u2014individuals, firms, and governments\u2014to make choices about how to allocate these scarce resources, leading to the concepts of opportunity cost and the three basic economic questions: what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: as insufficient capital to satisfy our wants**\nThis statement is too narrow. Capital is only one of the four factors of production, alongside land, labour, and enterprise. The economic problem arises from the scarcity of *all* productive resources, not just a shortage of capital. While insufficient capital can be a problem for an economy, it is a component of the broader economic problem, not its full definition.\n\n**B: as insufficient income to satisfy all our needs**\nThis description is inaccurate for two key reasons. Firstly, it confuses needs with wants. Needs are essential for survival (e.g., food, water, shelter) and are finite. Wants are desires that are not essential for survival and are considered unlimited. The economic problem is primarily concerned with unlimited wants, not just finite needs. Secondly, income is a monetary measure representing a claim on goods and services, not the physical resources themselves. The root problem is the lack of real resources to produce goods, not just the money to purchase them.\n\n**D: as insufficient wealth to satisfy all our needs**\nSimilar to option B, this statement incorrectly focuses on \"needs\" rather than \"unlimited wants.\" Needs are finite, whereas the core of the economic problem lies in the inability to satisfy unlimited wants. Furthermore, wealth, like income, is a monetary or asset-based concept. The fundamental issue is the physical scarcity of the factors of production (resources) required to create the goods and services that constitute wealth, not just the stock of wealth itself."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_212.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "2 what would be included in the factor of production land?\na bread\nb _ factory building\nc sports arena\nd_ wheat", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nIn economics, the factor of production 'land' refers to all natural resources used to produce goods and services. This includes not only the physical earth but also everything that is a 'gift of nature,' such as minerals, forests, water, and agricultural products in their raw form. Wheat, as a crop grown from the soil, is a primary agricultural product and is therefore classified as a natural resource, falling under the category of land.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: bread**\nBread is a finished good, not a factor of production. It is the output created by combining various factors of production: wheat (land), the baker (labour), and the oven and bakery (capital). While it could be an intermediate good in making a sandwich, it is not a primary, naturally occurring resource and thus is not classified as land.\n\n**B: factory building**\nA factory building is classified as 'capital', another factor of production. Capital refers to man-made goods that are used to produce other goods and services.

Consequently, every society must make choices about how to allocate its scarce resources. These choices are resolved by answering three key, interdependent questions.\n1.  **What to produce?** This question concerns the types and quantities of goods and services to be produced with limited resources. Societies must decide on the mix of products, for example, whether to produce more consumer goods (like cars and electronics) or more capital goods (like machinery and infrastructure).\n2.  **How to produce?** This question relates to the methods of production. It involves choosing the combination of factors of production (land, labour, capital) to be used. For instance, production can be labour-intensive (using more human effort) or capital-intensive (using more machinery). The choice depends on resource availability and cost.\n3.  **For whom to produce?** This question deals with the distribution of the goods and services produced. It determines who will receive and consume the output. Distribution can be based on income, wealth, need, or other criteria, depending on the economic system.\n\nOption A correctly identifies these three fundamental questions of resource allocation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option is incorrect because it replaces the fundamental question of \"how\" with \"when\". While the timing of production (\"when\") is a relevant business decision, it is not one of the three core questions that define how a society allocates its fundamental resources. The \"when\" question is a subsidiary consideration, often determined by market conditions, seasons, or technological cycles, and is considered part of the broader production and planning process rather than a primary question of resource allocation. The core issue is not the timing but the method of production itself (\"how\").\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes \"where\" and omits \"for whom\". The question of \"where\" to produce is a geographical or locational decision. While important, it is generally considered a component of the broader question, \"How to produce?\". Deciding on a factory's location, for instance, is part of the overall production strategy. More importantly, this option omits the crucial question of distribution, \"For whom to produce?\", which addresses who ultimately benefits from the economic output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it replaces the fundamental question of \"what\" with \"where\". Similar to the reasoning for option C, the question of \"where\" is a locational consideration that is typically subsumed under the \"how to produce\" question. Omitting \"what to produce?\" is a critical error, as deciding the specific goods and services to create is the very first step in the resource allocation process.

The demand for labour is a derived demand, meaning it is determined by the value of the output that labour can produce. As engineers become more productive, the value they generate for firms increases. Consequently, firms are willing to hire more engineers at any given wage rate. This causes the demand curve for labour to shift to the right, from D1 to D3. Assuming the number of engineers willing to work at each wage (the supply of labour) does not change, the supply curve remains at S1. The new equilibrium is established at the intersection of the new demand curve (D3) and the original supply curve (S1), which is point B. At this new equilibrium, both the wage rate and the quantity of labour employed are higher than at the original equilibrium point X.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** Point A represents an increase in the demand for labour (a shift from D1 to D3) and a decrease in the supply of labour (a shift from S1 to S2). While the increase in demand is correct due to higher productivity, there is no information to suggest that the supply of engineers would decrease. An increase in skills does not inherently mean fewer individuals are willing or able to work as engineers.\n\n**C:** Point C represents a decrease in the demand for labour, with the demand curve shifting from D1 to D2.

While the increase in demand is correct, the information provided focuses on the increased productivity of engineers, which is a factor that directly shifts the demand curve.

A 1-unit increase from the original 200 units would represent a 0.5% increase in quantity supplied ((1/200) x 100). Given a 10% price increase, this would result in a PES of 0.05 (0.5% / 10%), not the stated 1.0. This error may arise from confusing the absolute change in price ($1) with the change in quantity.\n\n**B: 10 units**\nThis answer is incorrect. A 10-unit increase from the original 200 units represents a 5% increase in quantity supplied ((10/200) x 100). With a 10% price increase, this would yield a PES of 0.5 (5% / 10%), which contradicts the given PES of 1.0. This mistake often occurs when the calculated percentage change (10%) is incorrectly taken as the absolute change in units (10 units).\n\n**D: 200 units**\nThis answer is incorrect. A 200-unit increase would mean the quantity supplied doubles, which is a 100% increase ((200/200) x 100). Given the 10% price increase, this would imply a PES of 10.0 (100% / 10%), not 1.0.

This payment lowers their production costs, which typically translates into lower fares for consumers. When public transport becomes cheaper, it becomes a more attractive substitute for private vehicles. As a result, some consumers will switch from driving their cars to using public transport. Since public transport carries many passengers at once, the total emissions per person are significantly lower than if each person drove individually. This shift in consumption from private to public transport leads to a reduction in the total number of vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing overall harmful emissions.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) increased expenditure on oil exploration**\nThis measure would likely have the opposite of the intended effect. Increased expenditure on oil exploration would aim to increase the supply of oil. A greater supply of oil would, all else being equal, lead to a decrease in the price of petrol and diesel. Lower fuel prices reduce the cost of driving private vehicles, which would incentivise more people to drive, leading to an increase in harmful emissions.\n\n**C) reduced taxation on the production of private vehicles**\nReducing taxes on the production of private vehicles would lower the costs for car manufacturers. This would likely lead to a decrease in the retail price of new cars. Lower car prices would increase the quantity demanded, encouraging more people to buy and use private vehicles. A greater number of private vehicles on the road would result in higher levels of pollution and harmful emissions, directly contradicting the government's objective.\n\n**D) reducing incentives to purchase electric vehicles**\nElectric vehicles are a key technology for reducing harmful emissions from road transport as they have no tailpipe emissions. Government incentives, such as grants or tax credits, make electric vehicles more affordable and encourage consumers to switch from traditional petrol or diesel cars. Reducing these incentives would make electric vehicles relatively more expensive, slowing down their adoption. This would keep more polluting vehicles on the road for longer, thereby hindering the effort to reduce emissions."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_220.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "10 what function does a central bank provide for an economy?\na __itissues bank notes to encourage spending.\nb_ it manages the debt of private sector firms.\nc it offers high interest rate accounts to encourage savings.\nd_ it provides mortgages to encourage home ownership.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA core and exclusive function of a central bank is to act as the sole issuer of a country's legal tender, which includes banknotes and coins.

Crafting a whole piece of furniture can provide a sense of achievement and job satisfaction. In contrast, performing a single, monotonous task on an assembly line can lead to boredom and a feeling of being disconnected from the final product, which is likely to decrease worker motivation.\n*   **Outcome 2: Average total cost will decrease.** Division of labour and mechanisation are key methods for increasing productivity. Workers become more efficient through specialisation (doing one task repeatedly), and machinery can perform tasks faster and more precisely than human labour. This leads to a significant increase in total output. While total costs may rise, the increase in output is proportionally greater, causing the cost per unit (average total cost) to fall. This is a primary driver for firms to adopt such production methods and benefit from economies of scale.\n*   **Outcome 3: Total costs will increase.** A mechanised production process requires significant capital investment in machinery and equipment. This increases the firm's fixed costs. Furthermore, as the firm is now able to produce a much larger quantity of furniture, its total variable costs (such as raw materials and wages for a larger workforce or more hours) will also increase. The combination of higher fixed and total variable costs results in an increase in the firm's overall total costs of production.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because worker motivation is likely to fall, not increase, due to the introduction of repetitive and less-skilled tasks. Furthermore, the average total cost is expected to decrease, not increase, as the main purpose of mechanisation and division of labour is to improve efficiency and lower the cost per unit.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that the average total cost will increase. A central advantage of shifting to mechanised production and division of labour is the gain in efficiency, which leads to a lower cost per unit of output (a decrease in average total cost), not an increase.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it states that total costs will decrease. The investment in new machinery represents a substantial increase in fixed costs. Additionally, producing at a higher volume will increase total variable costs (e.g., for wood and other materials).

This option accurately captures the fundamental role of a trade union in representing workers' interests collectively.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a group of countries that negotiates trade agreements**\nThis describes a trading bloc or a free trade area, not a trade union. A trading bloc (such as the European Union or the USMCA) is an intergovernmental agreement where barriers to trade (like tariffs and quotas) are reduced or eliminated among the participating states. The members are countries, and their goal is to facilitate international trade, not to negotiate employment conditions for workers.\n\n**B: a group of firms that negotiates removing obstacles to trade**\nThis definition describes a trade association or a business lobby group. Such organisations represent the interests of businesses, not workers. They might lobby governments to reduce regulations, lower corporate taxes, or remove barriers to international trade to benefit their member firms. Their focus is on the commercial interests of employers, which can sometimes be in opposition to the interests of workers represented by trade unions.\n\n**D: a group of workers that negotiates fixing prices**\nWhile trade unions are indeed groups of workers who negotiate, they do not negotiate the prices of the goods or services their employer sells. They negotiate the 'price' of their labour, which is their wage. The setting of product prices is a strategic decision made by the firm's management.

These arise from factors within the firm's control, such as purchasing raw materials in bulk at a discount (purchasing economies), using large-scale, efficient machinery (technical economies), and securing loans at lower interest rates (financial economies). Because a small firm operates on a limited scale, it is unable to produce the high levels of output needed to achieve these cost-saving benefits. This results in higher average costs compared to larger competitors, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a lack of external economies of scale**\nExternal economies of scale are cost advantages that arise from the growth of the entire industry or region, not the individual firm. These benefits, such as a pool of skilled labour or specialised local suppliers, are available to all firms in the area, regardless of their size. Therefore, a lack of these economies is a characteristic of the industry's location or development, not a disadvantage specific to the size of a single firm.\n\n**B. a lack of external diseconomies of scale**\nExternal diseconomies of scale are disadvantages that arise from the growth of an industry, leading to increased costs for all firms. Examples include traffic congestion or increased competition for local labour driving up wages. A 'lack of' these problems is an advantage, as it means the firm is not experiencing these external cost pressures. Since the question asks for a disadvantage, this option is incorrect.\n\n**D. a lack of internal diseconomies of scale**\nInternal diseconomies of scale occur when a firm becomes too large and inefficient, leading to rising average costs. These problems include poor communication, difficulties in coordination, and low employee morale. Small firms, due to their size, are very unlikely to suffer from these issues.

The standard ATC curve is U-shaped. The initial downward-sloping portion of the curve represents the range of output where a firm experiences economies of scale. This is because as production increases, the firm can benefit from factors such as specialisation of labour, bulk purchasing of raw materials, and more efficient use of capital, all of which lower the cost per unit.\n\nIn this graph, as the firm increases its output from Q\u2081 to Q\u2082, it moves along the downward-sloping part of its ATC curve. This results in the average total cost falling from C\u2081 to C\u2082, which correctly illustrates the concept of achieving economies of scale.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### B\nThis graph shows the firm operating on the upward-sloping portion of its ATC curve. As output increases from Q\u2081 to Q\u2082, the average total cost rises from C\u2081 to C\u2082. This situation represents diseconomies of scale, not economies of scale. Diseconomies of scale occur when a firm grows too large, leading to problems such as communication breakdowns, coordination issues, and reduced worker morale, which cause the average cost per unit to increase.\n\n#### C\nThis graph incorrectly depicts the ATC curve as an inverted U-shape. A standard ATC curve is U-shaped, reflecting that average costs first fall due to economies of scale and then rise due to diseconomies of scale. An inverted U-shape is not a valid representation of an average total cost curve. Furthermore, the movement from Q\u2081 to Q\u2082 shows an increase in average costs (from C\u2081 to C\u2082), which would represent diseconomies of scale, contrary to the question.\n\n#### D\nSimilar to option C, this graph presents an incorrect, inverted U-shaped curve for average total cost. The shape of the ATC curve is fundamentally flawed and does not align with established economic principles of cost behaviour.

A highly skilled chef is paid more than an unskilled cook.**\n\nWhile this statement is factually correct, it represents a **disadvantage**, not an advantage, to the restaurant.

Total cost is the sum of all costs incurred, which are separated into fixed costs (costs that do not change with output, like rent) and variable costs (costs that change with output, like raw materials).

This can be achieved through expansionary fiscal policy (e.g., increasing government spending or cutting taxes) or expansionary monetary policy (e.g., lowering interest rates). When these policies are implemented, more people become employed and earn an income. This, combined with the initial policy stimulus, leads to a significant rise in overall spending. If this increase in aggregate demand outpaces the economy's ability to produce goods and services (aggregate supply), it creates a situation of \"too much money chasing too few goods.\" This excess demand puts upward pressure on the general price level, causing demand-pull inflation.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: They encourage cheap imports.**\nThis is incorrect. While higher national income resulting from lower unemployment may lead to an increase in the volume of imports, the policies themselves do not necessarily make imports cheaper. In fact, the domestic inflation caused by these policies can make foreign goods appear relatively cheaper, but this is a consequence of inflation, not its root cause. Furthermore, some policies designed to reduce unemployment, such as tariffs, would make imports more expensive to protect domestic jobs.\n\n**C: They reduce firms' costs.**\nThis is incorrect. A reduction in firms' costs of production (e.g., lower wages or raw material prices) would lead to an increase in aggregate supply. This would result in both lower unemployment (as firms expand production) and a lower price level (disinflation). Therefore, reducing firms' costs helps to solve both problems simultaneously, rather than creating a trade-off. In reality, measures to reduce unemployment often lead to *higher* costs for firms, as a tighter labour market pushes up wages.\n\n**D: They require wages to fall.**\nThis is incorrect and describes the opposite of what happens. As unemployment falls, the labour market tightens, meaning there are fewer available workers for firms to hire. This increases competition among firms for labour, which puts upward pressure on wages. Rising wages increase firms' production costs, which can contribute to cost-push inflation, and they also increase consumer income, which boosts aggregate demand, further fuelling demand-pull inflation.

To find the total government spending on merit goods from the categories shown, one must sum the expenditure on education and health.\n\nThe spending on education is $36.4 billion, and the spending on health is $81.8 billion.\n\nTotal spending on merit goods = $36.4 billion + $81.8 billion = $118.2 billion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: $32.2 billion**\n\nThis figure represents the government spending on national defence. National defence is classified as a public good, not a merit good.

It typically leads to lower interest rates, making it cheaper for consumers and firms to borrow. This stimulates spending on goods and services (consumption) and on capital goods (investment), thereby increasing aggregate demand.\n\nWhen an economy is operating without spare capacity, it means it is already producing at or near its maximum potential output (full employment). In this situation, the aggregate supply is inelastic (the aggregate supply curve is steep or vertical). If aggregate demand increases, firms cannot significantly increase their output in the short run because all available resources (labour, capital) are already in use. Consequently, the increased demand competing for a fixed supply of goods and services bids up prices, leading to demand-pull inflation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. A higher exchange rate will make imports more expensive and improve the balance of payments.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A higher exchange rate, also known as an appreciation of the currency, means that the domestic currency is stronger and can buy more of a foreign currency. This makes imported goods and services cheaper for domestic consumers, not more expensive. Conversely, it makes domestic exports more expensive for foreign buyers. Cheaper imports are likely to increase import spending, while more expensive exports are likely to decrease export revenue. The combined effect is a likely worsening of the current account of the balance of payments, not an improvement.\n\n**B. An increase in interest rates will encourage investment and lead to higher economic growth.**\n\nThis statement describes the opposite of what typically occurs. Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing. An increase in interest rates makes it more expensive for firms to take out loans to finance investment in new capital, such as machinery and factories. Therefore, higher interest rates tend to *discourage* investment. Since investment is a key component of aggregate demand and a driver of long-term productive capacity, a decrease in investment would lead to lower, not higher, economic growth.\n\n**D. Higher interest rates result in less income from savings and therefore higher unemployment.**\n\nThis statement contains an incorrect premise.

With higher disposable income, consumers are likely to increase their spending on goods and services. Since consumption is a key component of aggregate demand, a rise in consumer spending leads to an overall increase in demand in the economy.\n\n*   **Impact on Supply:** Lower direct taxes on firms (corporation tax) increase their post-tax profits. This provides firms with more funds to reinvest in their business, such as purchasing new machinery or expanding their operations (capital investment). Furthermore, the prospect of higher retained profits acts as an incentive for firms to increase production. Additionally, lower income taxes can encourage individuals to work more or join the labour force, increasing the supply of labour. These factors lead to an increase in the productive capacity of the economy, thus increasing aggregate supply.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: decrease in demand, decrease in supply\n\nThis option is incorrect. A decrease in demand and supply would be the likely outcome of an *increase* in direct taxes, not a decrease. Higher income tax would reduce consumers' disposable income, leading to lower spending and decreased demand. Higher corporation tax would reduce firms' post-tax profits, discouraging investment and production, thereby decreasing supply.\n\n#### B: decrease in demand, increase in supply\n\nThis option is incorrect because a reduction in direct taxes is expected to increase, not decrease, demand. While the effect on supply (increase) is correctly identified, the effect on demand is wrong. Lower income taxes boost consumers' purchasing power, stimulating spending and increasing demand.\n\n#### D: increase in demand, decrease in supply\n\nThis option is incorrect because a reduction in direct taxes is likely to increase, not decrease, supply. While the effect on demand (increase) is correctly identified, the effect on supply is wrong. Lower corporation taxes enhance firms' profits and their ability to invest, and lower income taxes can incentivise work.

Economic development is often measured by indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The HDI includes an economic component (GNI per capita), but it was specifically created to provide a broader, more holistic view of development.

It is defined contextually, based on the prevailing economic and social conditions of a specific country or region. A person is considered to be in relative poverty if their standard of living is significantly lower than the minimum level considered acceptable by the general population of that society. This often means they are excluded from participating in the normal activities and enjoying the opportunities that most people take for granted.

A 12-year-old boy has never been able to access a doctor or school.**\nThis describes a situation of severe deprivation of basic human needs and services. This condition is more characteristic of absolute poverty, which is a state of lacking the fundamental resources necessary for survival and basic well-being, such as healthcare and education. While this individual is undoubtedly poor, the description focuses on a lack of essential services rather than the comparison with societal standards, which is the key element of relative poverty.\n\n**B. A person earns less than the minimum defined level of income.**\nThis statement describes a poverty line, which is a threshold used to measure poverty. However, a poverty line can be either absolute (a fixed amount needed for basic survival) or relative (a percentage of the median income in a society).

It is less precise than option C, which explicitly incorporates the societal context.\n\n**D. A person is unable to afford the basic necessities of life.**\nThis is the definition of absolute poverty, not relative poverty. Absolute poverty refers to a condition where individuals lack the resources to meet their fundamental needs for survival, including food, clean water, shelter, and clothing.

Tariffs and customs duties are taxes imposed on imported goods, which act as barriers to trade. By removing these barriers, the cost of trading between countries is reduced. This encourages countries to pursue free trade, allowing them to specialise in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage (i.e., they can produce at a lower opportunity cost). They can then export these goods and import others that are produced more efficiently elsewhere. This leads to a more efficient allocation of global resources and increases overall economic welfare.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: similarities in climate in different countries**\nInternational specialisation is often based on *differences* in factor endowments, including climate. For instance, countries with tropical climates may specialise in producing goods like coffee or bananas, while countries with temperate climates specialise in wheat or apples. If countries had similar climates, they would likely be able to produce the same types of agricultural products, which would reduce the incentive to specialise and trade based on climatic advantage. Therefore, similarities in climate would tend to hinder, not promote, specialisation.\n\n**B: similarities in the availability of natural resources in different countries**\nSimilar to climate, specialisation is frequently driven by *differences* in the availability of natural resources. A country with abundant oil reserves will specialise in oil extraction and export, while a country with rich iron ore deposits will specialise in steel production. If countries possessed similar natural resources, they would have a similar capacity to produce certain goods, thereby diminishing the gains from and the need for specialisation and international trade based on those resources.\n\n**C: instability in foreign exchange rates**\nInstability in foreign exchange rates creates uncertainty and risk in international trade. Fluctuating exchange rates make it difficult for exporters and importers to predict the future revenues from sales or the future costs of purchases. This risk can deter firms from engaging in international trade and making long-term investments in production for export markets. A stable economic environment, including stable exchange rates, is more conducive to fostering the long-term relationships and investment required for international specialisation. Therefore, instability would discourage, not promote, specialisation."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_238.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 whatare the effects on price and equilibrium quantity of the imposition of an import tariff on a good?\ntice equilibrium\np quantity\na decreases decreases\nb decreases increases\nc increases decreases\nd increases increases", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn import tariff is a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other countries. This tax increases the cost for foreign producers to sell their goods in the domestic market. The increase in cost leads to a decrease in the supply of the imported good. When combined with domestic supply, the total supply curve for the good in the market shifts to the left. Given a constant demand curve, this leftward shift in the supply curve results in a new, higher equilibrium price. At this higher price, consumers will demand a smaller quantity of the good, as dictated by the law of demand. Consequently, the overall equilibrium quantity of the good bought and sold in the market decreases.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. decreases, decreases**\nThis is incorrect. A tariff, being a tax on imports, increases the cost of bringing the good into the country. An increase in costs leads to a decrease in supply, which causes the market price to rise, not fall. While the equilibrium quantity does decrease, the effect on price is an increase.\n\n**B. decreases, increases**\nThis is incorrect. A tariff makes imported goods more expensive, which reduces total supply and leads to a higher market price. An increase in equilibrium quantity would only occur if the price were to fall (which it does not) or if demand were to increase significantly, which is not a direct effect of a tariff. The combination of a lower price and higher quantity is inconsistent with the economic effects of a tax on imports.\n\n**D. increases, increases**\nThis is incorrect. While the imposition of a tariff does lead to an increase in the market price, it does not lead to an increase in the equilibrium quantity. According to the law of demand, a higher price will cause the quantity demanded by consumers to fall.

This occurs when foreign entities need more of the currency to purchase the country's goods, services, or assets. A rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) into India means that foreign firms and investors are purchasing more Indian assets, such as factories, companies, or real estate. To make these purchases, they must first exchange their own currency for Indian rupees, thereby increasing the demand for rupees on the foreign exchange market. This increased demand is represented by a rightward shift of the demand curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a fall in Indian exports to the US**\nThis would cause the demand curve for rupees to shift to the left, not the right. When the US buys exports from India, US importers must exchange US dollars for Indian rupees to pay Indian producers. A fall in these exports means that fewer rupees are needed by US importers. Consequently, the demand for Indian rupees decreases, causing the demand curve to shift to the left (e.g., from D2 to D1).\n\n**B: a fall in the US inflation rate**\nA fall in the US inflation rate, assuming the Indian inflation rate remains constant, makes US-made goods and services relatively cheaper than Indian ones. This would likely cause US consumers to buy fewer Indian imports and Indian consumers to buy more US imports. A reduction in US demand for Indian goods leads to a decrease in the demand for Indian rupees. Therefore, this would cause the demand curve for rupees to shift to the left.\n\n**D: a rise in interest rates in the US**\nHigher interest rates in the US make it more attractive for investors to save or invest their money in the US to earn a higher return. This would likely lead to a decrease in financial investment flowing from the US to India, as investors shift their capital to the US. This reduction in investment into India decreases the demand for Indian rupees.

It refers to the fundamental problem that human wants for goods and services are unlimited, while the resources available to produce them (land, labour, capital, and enterprise) are finite. Therefore, a direct and unavoidable consequence of scarce resources is that the collective wants of a society will always exceed its productive capacity. Productive capacity represents the maximum possible output an economy can generate with its existing resources and technology. Because this capacity is limited, it is impossible to satisfy every want of every individual. This fundamental imbalance forces societies to make choices about what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. production will cause external costs**\nExternal costs, or negative externalities, are the negative impacts of production or consumption on a third party not involved in the economic transaction (e.g., pollution from a factory affecting a local community). While the use of scarce resources in production *can* lead to external costs, this is not a necessary or guaranteed consequence. It is possible for production to occur with minimal or no external costs, or for governments to implement policies (such as taxes or regulations) that force producers to internalise these costs. Therefore, external costs are a potential outcome of certain types of production, not an inevitable result of scarcity itself.\n\n**B. relative poverty will gradually increase**\nRelative poverty measures the extent to which a household's financial resources fall below the average income level in a given society. While scarcity means that not everyone's wants can be satisfied, it does not dictate that relative poverty must increase. Economic growth can expand a country's productive capacity, potentially raising living standards for all. Furthermore, government policies, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs, can be used to redistribute income and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. Consequently, relative poverty can either increase, decrease, or remain stable, depending on economic performance and policy choices, not just the existence of scarcity.\n\n**C. sustainable development will take place**\nSustainable development is an approach to economic growth that aims to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is a proactive policy choice made in *response* to the problem of scarcity, particularly the depletion of non-renewable resources. The existence of scarcity does not guarantee that sustainable practices will be adopted.

Since timber is a key material for building houses, this boom leads to an increase in the demand for timber. An increase in demand is represented graphically as a rightward shift of the demand curve.\n\nSimultaneously, a shortage of drivers to deliver the timber represents a disruption to the supply chain.

There is a positive relationship between quantity supplied and price.**\n\nA supply curve is a graphical representation of the law of supply. The law of supply states that, *ceteris paribus* (all other factors being held constant), as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity that producers are willing and able to supply also increases. Conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases. This direct, or positive, relationship between price and quantity supplied is illustrated by the upward slope of the supply curve. A higher price provides a greater incentive for firms to produce and sell more, as it increases their potential for revenue and profit.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. A firm will supply more when consumers' purchasing power increases.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it confuses a determinant of demand with the concept of supply. An increase in consumers' purchasing power (or income) affects the demand for a good, not the supply. When consumers have more purchasing power, they can afford to buy more goods at each price level, which typically causes the demand curve to shift to the right. While this may lead to a higher market price and consequently a greater quantity supplied (a movement along the supply curve), the supply curve itself simply illustrates the relationship between price and quantity supplied, assuming factors like consumer income are constant.\n\n**B. The higher the price, the fewer goods are supplied as costs of production increase.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly describes the law of supply. The law of supply dictates that a higher price leads to a *greater* quantity supplied, not fewer. The premise is that higher prices make it more profitable for firms to increase output. The statement also inaccurately links a higher price for the good with an increase in the costs of production. A change in the price of the good causes a movement *along* the supply curve, whereas a change in the costs of production is a non-price factor that would *shift* the entire supply curve.\n\n**C. The lower the price, the more profit is made by the firm.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. A lower price, all else being equal, reduces the revenue a firm receives for each unit sold, thereby decreasing the potential for profit. Firms are incentivised to supply *less* at lower prices because production may become unprofitable.

A higher PES value indicates that producers are more responsive to price changes.\n\nA PES of 1.5 signifies that supply is **elastic**. This means that for a given percentage change in price, the percentage change in quantity supplied will be larger. In the context of a decrease in demand for air travel, the demand curve shifts to the left, causing the equilibrium price to fall. With elastic supply (PES = 1.5), airlines will respond to this fall in price by significantly reducing the quantity of tickets they are willing to supply. This large reduction in quantity supplied leads to the greatest fall in the number of tickets sold compared to the other options.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: 0**\nA price elasticity of supply of 0 indicates that supply is **perfectly inelastic**. This means that the quantity supplied does not change at all, regardless of any change in price. Graphically, this is represented by a vertical supply curve. If the demand for air travel decreases, the price of tickets will fall, but the number of tickets supplied will remain exactly the same. Therefore, a PES of 0 would result in no fall in the number of tickets, which is the smallest possible change, not the largest.\n\n**B: 0.5**\nA price elasticity of supply of 0.5 indicates that supply is **inelastic**. This means that the quantity supplied is not very responsive to changes in price. A percentage decrease in the price of air travel tickets would lead to a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity of tickets supplied. While there would be a fall in the number of tickets, this fall would be less significant than if the supply were unit elastic or elastic.\n\n**C: 1**\nA price elasticity of supply of 1 indicates that supply is **unit elastic**. This means that the percentage change in quantity supplied is equal to the percentage change in price. When the demand for air travel decreases and prices fall, the number of tickets supplied will fall by the same percentage. This response is greater than for inelastic supply (PES < 1) but smaller than for elastic supply (PES > 1). Therefore, it does not represent the largest possible fall in the number of tickets."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_248.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "8 what is a disadvantage of a market economy?\na not enough competition\nb_ not enough merit goods\nc  noconsumer choice\nd - state intervention", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nIn a market economy, resource allocation is determined by the forces of supply and demand, with producers motivated by profit. Merit goods, such as education and healthcare, are goods that provide significant benefits to society (positive externalities) beyond the private benefits to the individual consumer. However, because private firms are driven by profitability, they will only supply goods that consumers are willing and able to pay for. Many individuals may underestimate the long-term benefits of merit goods or may not be able to afford them. Consequently, the market mechanism leads to an under-provision and under-consumption of merit goods, which is a significant form of market failure and a key disadvantage of a pure market economy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: not enough competition**\nThis is generally incorrect. A key feature and a major advantage of a market economy is the presence of competition among firms. Competition helps to drive prices down, improve quality, and encourage innovation. While it is true that an unregulated market can sometimes lead to the formation of monopolies, which reduces competition, the fundamental principle of the system is based on competition, not a lack of it.\n\n**C: no consumer choice**\nThis statement is incorrect. A defining advantage of a market economy is the high degree of consumer choice. Producers compete to meet the wants and needs of consumers, leading to a wide variety of goods and services. This concept, known as consumer sovereignty, is central to how a market economy functions. A lack of consumer choice is a characteristic more commonly associated with a command economy.\n\n**D: state intervention**\nThis is incorrect because a pure market economy is characterised by the *absence* of significant state intervention. Economic decisions are made by private individuals and firms. State intervention is a feature of mixed or command economies, and it is often introduced to correct the disadvantages of a pure market system, such as the under-provision of merit goods. Therefore, state intervention is not a disadvantage *of* a market economy, but rather a response *to* its disadvantages."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_249.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "9  droughts in some countries caused the supply of wheat to fall. wheat prices then rose providing\nan opportunity for wheat producers in other countries to increase supply.\nwhy might the price of wheat continue to be high in the year following the drought?\na __ different weather conditions allowed a bumper harvest.\nb suppliers unaffected by drought failed to increase output.\nc_ the government introduced a subsidy to wheat producers.\nd_ the wheat market returned to its original equilibrium.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe initial drought caused a significant reduction in the global supply of wheat, leading to a higher equilibrium price. The question asks for a reason why this high price might persist. If suppliers in countries unaffected by the drought fail to increase their output, the total market supply remains low. With supply constrained and assuming demand remains relatively constant, the market price will continue to be high. This failure to increase output could be due to various factors, such as the time lags inherent in agricultural production (it takes time to plant, grow, and harvest more wheat) or limited production capacity, meaning supply is inelastic in the short run.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Different weather conditions allowed a bumper harvest.**\nA bumper harvest signifies an unusually large agricultural yield. This would lead to a significant increase in the supply of wheat. According to the law of supply, an increase in supply, ceteris paribus (all other things being equal), causes the equilibrium price to fall. This outcome is the opposite of the price remaining high.\n\n**C: The government introduced a subsidy to wheat producers.**\nA subsidy is a form of financial aid from the government to producers. It effectively lowers their costs of production. Lower costs incentivise producers to increase their output at every price level, shifting the market supply curve to the right. An increase in supply would lead to a lower market price, not a persistently high one.\n\n**D: The wheat market returned to its original equilibrium.**\nThe original equilibrium is the price and quantity that existed before the drought. The drought caused a supply shock that moved the market away from this equilibrium to a new one with a higher price.

Supply is more inelastic in the short run and becomes more elastic over the long run. The construction of new houses is a complex and lengthy process, often taking many months or even years from planning to completion. Even if the government relaxes building regulations, which might reduce the time and cost of gaining approvals, the physical act of building a house still takes a significant amount of time. Consequently, producers cannot immediately increase the quantity of houses supplied in response to a price increase. This inherent time lag in production is the fundamental reason why the supply of newly built houses remains inelastic in the short term, and why the government's aim to make it more elastic cannot be achieved immediately.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Banks will only lend to high-income earners.**\nThis statement relates to the **demand** for housing, not the supply. Bank lending criteria determine who can afford to purchase a house by obtaining a mortgage. While this influences the overall housing market, it does not explain the production-side constraints that affect the responsiveness of supply to price changes. The question specifically asks why the *supply* of houses will not become more elastic immediately.\n\n**B. Costs of building materials fluctuate according to season.**\nWhile seasonal fluctuations in the cost of materials do affect the overall cost of production and can influence a firm's willingness to supply, this is not the primary reason for the immediate inelasticity of supply. The most significant constraint on immediately increasing the number of new houses is the long production and construction time, not short-term or seasonal cost variations.\n\n**D. Population increases lead to greater housing demand.**\nThis factor affects the **demand** for housing. An increase in population shifts the demand curve for housing to the right, typically leading to higher prices. This might create a greater incentive for firms to build more houses, but it does not change the fundamental time constraints on the production process.

Therefore, the core purpose of a trade union is to protect the rights of the group of workers it represents.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: the profit of a firm**\nThis is incorrect. The objectives of a trade union are often in direct conflict with a firm's goal of maximising profit.

The market for electricity supply to a city is a classic example of a natural monopoly.\n\n1.  **Barriers to Entry:** For a firm to remain the sole supplier, there must be significant obstacles preventing other firms from entering the market. In the case of electricity supply, these barriers are exceptionally **high**. They include enormous start-up costs for building power plants and a transmission grid, significant economies of scale (where the cost per unit decreases as production increases), and often, exclusive government licenses.\n2.  **Long-run Profit:** Because high barriers to entry protect the monopolist from new competition, the firm can earn supernormal profits (profits above the minimum required to stay in business) and sustain them in the **long run**. New firms are unable to enter the market to compete these profits away.\n3.  **Pricing Decision:** As the only firm in the market, a monopoly has substantial market power. It is not forced to accept a market price set by the forces of supply and demand. Instead, it can choose its price and output level to maximise its profit. Therefore, a monopolist is a **price maker**.\n\nThis combination of high barriers to entry, the potential for high long-run profit, and being a price maker accurately describes a monopoly.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B:** A firm with high barriers to entry is protected from competition, which is the very reason it can sustain high long-run profits. The combination of high barriers and low long-run profit is contradictory. Furthermore, a firm that is a sole supplier has significant market power and is a price maker, not a price taker. A price taker, characteristic of perfect competition, has no control over the market price.\n\n**C:** The premise of low barriers to entry is incorrect for a monopoly. If barriers to entry were low, other firms would be attracted by the high long-run profits and would enter the market, eliminating the firm's status as the sole supplier. While a monopolist is a price maker, the combination with low barriers to entry is not a stable or likely market structure.\n\n**D:** This combination of characteristics\u2014low barriers to entry, low (normal) long-run profit, and being a price taker\u2014describes a firm in a perfectly competitive market.

A budget deficit occurs when government spending exceeds its revenue (primarily from taxation). This represents an expansionary fiscal policy. By spending more money in the economy (e.g., on infrastructure, public services) or by reducing taxes, the government increases aggregate demand. Higher aggregate demand incentivises firms to increase their output of goods and services. To produce more, firms will need to hire additional labour, which leads to a rise in the overall level of employment.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a decrease in economic growth**\nThis is incorrect. A budget deficit, acting as an expansionary fiscal policy, is designed to stimulate, not reduce, economic activity. The increase in government spending and/or decrease in taxes raises aggregate demand, leading to a higher real GDP. This represents an increase, not a decrease, in economic growth.\n\n**B: a decrease in inflation**\nThis is incorrect. An expansionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand.

In this scenario, the government collects income tax (primarily from middle and high-income earners) and uses this revenue to fund public services like healthcare. By providing these healthcare services to low-income groups who do not pay income tax, the government is effectively transferring resources from higher-income earners to lower-income earners.

The interest rate represents the cost of borrowing for firms. When the central bank reduces the interest rate, it becomes cheaper for businesses to take out loans to finance capital expenditure. This makes previously marginal investment projects more profitable, thereby incentivising firms to increase their spending on new machinery, technology, and infrastructure. Consequently, a lower interest rate typically leads to an increase in the overall level of investment in the economy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a decrease in the rate of inflation**\nReducing the interest rate is likely to cause an *increase*, not a decrease, in the rate of inflation. A lower interest rate encourages both consumer spending (consumption) and business spending (investment) because borrowing becomes cheaper and saving becomes less attractive. This rise in spending increases aggregate demand. If the economy's productive capacity does not expand at the same rate, this excess demand will put upward pressure on the general price level, leading to demand-pull inflation.\n\n**C. an increase in the level of savings**\nThe interest rate is the reward for saving. When the interest rate falls, households and firms receive a lower return on their saved funds. This reduces the incentive to save and increases the incentive to spend. Therefore, a reduction in the interest rate is expected to lead to a *decrease* in the overall level of savings in the economy as consumption becomes relatively more attractive.\n\n**D. an increase in unemployment**\nA reduction in the interest rate is designed to stimulate economic activity and *decrease* unemployment. By encouraging higher levels of investment and consumption, the policy boosts aggregate demand. To meet this increased demand for goods and services, firms will need to increase their output.

Their primary objective is to improve the quantity and quality of the factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise), thereby increasing the economy's potential output. This is represented graphically by a rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. Policies such as investment in education and training, deregulation, and infrastructure development all aim to make the economy more efficient and productive, thus improving its productive potential.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. increasing direct taxation**\nThis is typically the opposite of a supply-side policy objective. Supply-side economists often advocate for *reducing* direct taxes (such as income tax and corporation tax) to create incentives. Lower income taxes can encourage people to work more or join the labour force, while lower corporation taxes can encourage firms to invest and expand. Increasing direct taxation would likely act as a disincentive to work and invest, potentially hindering the economy's productive capacity.\n\n**C. increasing the power of trade unions**\nThis is contrary to the aims of many supply-side policies. A key objective of supply-side policy is to make labour markets more flexible and competitive. Policies are often introduced to *reduce* the power of trade unions to prevent them from pushing wages above market-clearing levels or resisting new, more efficient work practices. It is believed that overly powerful trade unions can increase costs for firms and create labour market rigidities, which can reduce an economy's overall competitiveness and productive potential.\n\n**D. promoting the public sector**\nSupply-side policies are generally associated with promoting the private sector and the role of market forces. Key supply-side measures include privatisation (transferring state-owned assets to the private sector) and deregulation (reducing government controls on industries). The underlying principle is that the profit motive in the private sector leads to greater efficiency and innovation than can be achieved in the public sector. While government spending on education or infrastructure (public sector activities) can be a form of supply-side policy, the general objective is not to expand the public sector's role but rather to enhance the conditions for the private sector to thrive."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_261.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "21 an increase in which economic indicator best describes economic growth?\na general price level\nb level of consumption\nc level of output\nd living standards", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nEconomic growth is formally defined as the increase in the productive capacity of an economy over time. This increase is measured by the rise in the real (inflation-adjusted) value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. This total measure of production is known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, an increase in the level of output (real GDP) is the most accurate and direct indicator of economic growth. It signifies that the economy is producing more goods and services than before.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. general price level**\nAn increase in the general price level is known as inflation. Inflation measures the rate at which the average prices of goods and services are rising, which leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of a currency. It is a measure of price stability, not economic growth. While inflation can occur during periods of economic growth, it is a separate economic concept and not the definition or primary indicator of growth itself.\n\n**B. level of consumption**\nWhile an increase in the level of consumption can contribute to economic growth (as consumption is the largest component of aggregate demand and GDP), it is not the definition of economic growth. Economic growth is a broader measure of the total output of an economy, which also includes investment, government spending, and net exports. Focusing solely on consumption overlooks these other critical components of production and economic activity. Growth is fundamentally about the capacity to produce, not just the act of consuming.\n\n**D. living standards**\nAn improvement in living standards is a potential and desirable outcome of economic growth, but it is not the definition of economic growth. Living standards are a broader concept encompassing factors such as income levels, access to quality healthcare and education, life expectancy, and environmental quality. While economic growth (increased output) can provide the resources to improve living standards, the two are not synonymous. For example, economic growth could occur without a widespread improvement in living standards if the benefits are not distributed evenly or if growth is accompanied by negative externalities like pollution."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_262.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "22 what is full employment considered to be?\na nocyclical unemployment\nb no frictional unemployment\nc no private sector unemployment\nd no seasonal unemployment", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nIn macroeconomics, **full employment** does not mean that the unemployment rate is zero. Instead, it refers to a situation where the economy is operating at its **natural rate of unemployment**. This natural rate includes forms of unemployment that are always present in a dynamic economy, such as frictional and structural unemployment. Full employment is achieved when there is no **cyclical unemployment**. Cyclical unemployment is the type of unemployment that rises during economic downturns (recessions) and falls when the economy improves. Therefore, an economy at full employment is producing its potential output, and any existing unemployment is due to natural factors, not a downturn in the business cycle.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B. no frictional unemployment:** Frictional unemployment is the temporary unemployment that occurs when workers are between jobs or are new to the labour force. It is a natural and unavoidable part of a healthy, changing economy because it takes time for workers to search for and find new jobs. As such, frictional unemployment exists even when the economy is at full employment. A complete absence of frictional unemployment is unrealistic and not the definition of full employment.\n\n**C. no private sector unemployment:** This is incorrect because full employment is a concept that applies to the entire economy, not just one sector. Furthermore, even at full employment, there will be natural unemployment (frictional, structural, seasonal) in both the private and public sectors. A situation with zero unemployment in the private sector is not a recognized definition of full employment and would be practically impossible to achieve.\n\n**D. no seasonal unemployment:** Seasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for labour changes according to the season, such as in agriculture or tourism. Like frictional and structural unemployment, seasonal unemployment is considered a component of the natural rate of unemployment. An economy can be at full employment while still experiencing predictable, seasonal patterns of joblessness. Therefore, the absence of seasonal unemployment is not the correct definition of full employment."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_263.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "23 which group is most likely to benefit during a period of rapid inflation?\na exporters\nb pensioners\nc_ people with debts\nd savers", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C. people with debts\n\nDuring a period of rapid inflation, the general price level rises, and the real value (purchasing power) of money falls. People who have borrowed money (debtors) benefit from this situation. This is because the debt they owe is typically a fixed nominal amount. As inflation rises, the real value of this fixed debt decreases. They will repay their loan in the future with money that is worth less than the money they originally borrowed. For example, if an individual's wages rise with inflation but their monthly loan repayment remains fixed, the repayment becomes a smaller proportion of their income, making the debt easier to manage and pay off. The real burden of their debt is reduced.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. exporters**\nExporters are generally harmed by a period of rapid domestic inflation. High inflation increases the costs of production within the country, including wages, raw materials, and other overheads. To maintain their profit margins, exporting firms would need to increase the prices of their goods and services. These higher prices make their products less competitive in international markets, as foreign buyers may turn to cheaper alternatives from other countries. This can lead to a decrease in export sales, revenue, and profitability.\n\n**B. pensioners**\nPensioners are typically one of the groups most negatively affected by rapid inflation. Many pensioners rely on a fixed income from their pension schemes, which does not automatically increase with inflation. As the general level of prices for goods and services rises, the purchasing power of their fixed income falls. This means they can afford to buy fewer goods and services than before, leading to a significant decline in their real income and standard of living.\n\n**D. savers**\nSavers are also negatively affected by rapid inflation. Inflation erodes the real value of the money they have saved. While savings in a bank account earn a nominal interest rate, during periods of rapid inflation, the rate of inflation is often higher than the nominal interest rate. This results in a negative real interest rate (real interest rate \u2248 nominal interest rate - inflation rate). Consequently, the purchasing power of their savings decreases over time, even with the interest earned.

Total GNI does not account for the size of a country's population. For example, a country with a very large population might have a high total GNI, but the income per person could be very low. The HDI uses GNI per head to provide a measure of the average standard of living for an individual in that country.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect as it includes 'population growth' and 'adult literacy rate' as components. Population growth is not a direct measure used in the HDI calculation. While 'adult literacy rate' was a component of the HDI formula prior to 2010, it has since been replaced by 'mean years of schooling' to provide a more nuanced measure of educational attainment. Although GNI per head is a correct component, the other two are not.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it includes 'population size' and 'number of doctors per head'. Population size is not an indicator of development in the HDI framework; the index focuses on average individual outcomes.

This outcome is the direct result of a falling birth rate combined with a falling death rate.\n\n*   A **falling birth rate** means that fewer children are being born each year. This reduces the size of the youngest age groups, decreasing the proportion of young people in the total population.\n*   A **falling death rate** indicates that people are living longer, a phenomenon known as increasing life expectancy. This is often due to advances in healthcare, improved nutrition, and better sanitation. As people live to an older age, the number and proportion of elderly individuals in the population grow.\n\nWhen both trends occur simultaneously, the base of the population pyramid (representing the young) narrows, while the top (representing the old) widens. This combination must produce an ageing population.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: a rising birth rate and a rising death rate**\nThis scenario would lead to a younger population, not an ageing one. A rising birth rate increases the proportion of young people, which lowers the average age. A rising death rate means a lower life expectancy, reducing the number of people who survive to old age. Both factors contribute to creating a more youthful population structure.\n\n**C: a rising marriage rate and a falling death rate**\nThis situation does not guarantee an ageing population. While a falling death rate contributes to ageing by increasing life expectancy, a rising marriage rate could potentially lead to a higher birth rate.

As the impact on the birth rate is uncertain, this scenario does not *must* produce an ageing population.\n\n**D: a falling marriage rate and a rising death rate**\nThis scenario is unlikely to produce an ageing population. A rising death rate reduces life expectancy and the proportion of older people, which works directly against the ageing trend.

When aggregate demand decreases, consumers, businesses, and the government are spending less. In response to this lower demand, firms cut back on production. To produce fewer goods and services, firms need fewer workers, leading them to stop hiring and lay off existing staff. This type of unemployment, which rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves, is known as cyclical or demand-deficient unemployment. It is the main cause of high unemployment rates during a recession.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B) movement of labour between countries**\nThe movement of labour between countries (migration) can affect a country's unemployment rate by changing the size of the labour supply. However, it is not the primary cause of the widespread increase in unemployment that occurs during a recession. A recession is an economy-wide phenomenon driven by a lack of demand, which affects the ability of domestic firms to employ the existing workforce, irrespective of migration patterns.\n\n**C) reduced levels of technological change**\nTechnological change itself can be a cause of structural unemployment, as automation and new processes may make certain job skills obsolete. However, a *reduction* in the level of technological change would not cause an increase in unemployment.

A recessionary increase in unemployment is caused by a cyclical downturn in the economy, not by a change in the rate of innovation.\n\n**D) regional inequalities of wealth**\nRegional inequalities of wealth can lead to structural unemployment, where economically depressed regions experience persistently high unemployment due to a lack of investment and job opportunities.

This repetition allows workers to become highly skilled and efficient at their specific job, leading to a significant increase in overall productivity. Higher productivity means that more output can be produced with the same or fewer resources, which lowers the average cost of production for the firm. In a competitive market, firms are likely to pass these cost savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices to attract customers and increase market share.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: for the country there will be less dependency on international trade**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Specialisation at a national level means a country concentrates its resources on producing the goods and services where it has a comparative advantage, and produces less of, or stops producing, other goods. To satisfy the needs and wants of its population, the country must import the goods it no longer produces. In return, it exports the goods it specialises in. This process inherently leads to an *increase*, not a decrease, in dependency on international trade.\n\n**C: for the employee the work will become more varied**\n\nThis is the opposite of what occurs with an extension of specialisation. Specialisation requires workers to focus on a narrow, specific, and often repetitive task. For example, in a car factory, one worker might only fit the front-left wheel. While this increases efficiency, it reduces the variety of tasks the employee performs, which can lead to monotony and boredom. Therefore, the work becomes less, not more, varied.\n\n**D: for the producer there will be less efficiency**\n\nThis statement is incorrect as the primary goal and result of specialisation is to *increase* efficiency. By having workers concentrate on single tasks, they become quicker and more proficient, wasting less time and materials.

When a tariff is imposed, it increases the cost of importing the product. This additional cost is typically passed on to consumers in the domestic market, leading to an increase in the price of the product. Therefore, the statement \"the price of the product increases\" is correct.\n\nAccording to the law of demand, as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded for that good decreases. Since the tariff raises the price of the imported product, domestic consumers will buy less of it. Consequently, the quantity of the product that is imported will fall. The quantity is not fixed; it changes in response to the price change. Therefore, the statement \"the quantity of the product imported is fixed\" is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because a tariff directly increases the cost of imported goods, which leads to a higher price for consumers in the domestic market.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect on both points. A tariff causes the price of the imported product to increase, not stay the same. Furthermore, the quantity of imports is not fixed; it decreases as a result of the higher price.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect because it confuses the effects of a tariff with those of a quota. While a tariff does increase the price of the product, it does not fix the quantity of imports. The quantity of imports decreases due to the higher price.

This means that countries wishing to purchase oil must first acquire USD, creating a demand for the US dollar in the foreign exchange market. The total global expenditure on oil determines the total demand for USD for this purpose.\n\nThe question states that the demand for oil is price-inelastic. This is a key piece of information. For a good with price-inelastic demand, a change in price leads to a proportionally smaller change in the quantity demanded. Consequently, when the price of an inelastic good falls, the total expenditure on that good also falls. This is because the percentage increase in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage decrease in price.\n\nTherefore, a rapid fall in the price of oil will lead to a decrease in the total amount of money spent on oil worldwide. Since oil is paid for in USD, this means there will be a lower overall demand for US dollars from oil-importing nations.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, a decrease in demand for a currency, assuming supply remains relatively constant, will cause its price to fall. The price of a currency is its exchange rate. Thus, a lower demand for the US dollar will lead to a decrease in its exchange rate, meaning the US dollar depreciates.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: greater demand for US$, exchange rate for US$ increases**\nThis is incorrect. As explained above, because the demand for oil is price-inelastic, a fall in its price leads to a decrease in total expenditure on oil. This results in *less*, not greater, demand for the US dollar. A decrease in demand would cause the exchange rate to fall, not increase.\n\n**B: greater supply of US$, exchange rate for US$ decreases**\nThis is incorrect because the scenario described primarily affects the *demand* for US dollars, not the supply. The demand for US dollars comes from oil-importing countries that need to buy them. A greater supply of US dollars would indeed cause the exchange rate to decrease, but the initial event (a fall in the price of oil) does not directly cause a greater supply of US dollars on the foreign exchange market.\n\n**D: less supply of US$, exchange rate for US$ increases**\nThis is incorrect. The primary impact is on the demand for US dollars. While one could argue that oil-exporting nations receiving fewer dollars might supply fewer dollars to the market (when converting them to their own currencies), this is a secondary effect. The primary effect is the reduced demand from importers.

MNCs conduct business and generate revenue in various host countries, but their headquarters and ownership are based in the home country. A significant portion of the profits earned from these international operations is sent back to the home country. This inflow of funds represents a credit on the current account of the home country's balance of payments, strengthening its international financial position. These repatriated profits can then be used to pay dividends to domestic shareholders, be reinvested into research and development within the home country, or be taxed by the home government, thereby increasing government revenue.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: higher wages**\nHigher wages are generally considered a benefit for the *host* country, not the home country. When an MNC sets up operations in a host country, particularly a developing one, it often pays wages that are higher than the local average to attract skilled workers. This can help to raise overall wage levels in the host economy. For the home country, the impact is not a direct increase in wages; in some cases, the outsourcing of jobs to lower-wage countries can even place downward pressure on the wages of certain domestic workers.\n\n**C: increased employment**\nIncreased employment is a key advantage for the *host* country where the MNC establishes its production facilities, call centres, or other operations. This creates jobs for the local workforce in the host nation. Conversely, for the home country, the decision by an MNC to move its production abroad can lead to a decrease in domestic employment, a phenomenon known as structural unemployment, as factories or offices in the home country may be closed down.\n\n**D: more investment**\nThe initial setup and expansion of an MNC's operations in a foreign country constitute Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). This is an injection of capital and a major benefit for the *host* country's economy, as it involves building factories, purchasing equipment, and developing infrastructure.

Because economic goods are scarce, their production requires the use of limited resources (factors of production). These resources have alternative uses.

Goods and services become more scarce when the quantity available decreases relative to the wants of the population.\n\nA leftward shift of the Production Possibility Curve (PPC) indicates a decrease in the economy's productive potential. This means the maximum quantity of goods and services that can be produced has fallen, perhaps due to a loss of resources or a decline in technology. Simultaneously, an increase in the population size means there are more people with wants and needs to be satisfied. The combination of a reduced supply of goods and services (PPC shifts left) and increased demand from a larger population will inevitably make those goods and services more scarce.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: PPC shifts right, population size unchanged**\nA rightward shift of the PPC signifies economic growth, meaning the economy can produce more goods and services than before. If the population size remains unchanged, there are more goods and services available for the same number of people.

In this system, economic decisions, such as what to produce, how much to produce, and what price to charge, are determined by the free interaction of individuals and firms in markets, driven by the forces of supply and demand.

Option C correctly identifies these core features: private ownership exists, while public ownership and government allocation do not.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because it states that a market economy lacks private ownership of the factors of production and instead has government allocation of production. This is the opposite of a market economy. Private ownership is a cornerstone of this system, and resources are allocated by the price mechanism, not by the government.\n\n**B:** This option describes the features of a planned or command economy, not a market economy.

It will increase.**\n\nSubstitute goods are products that a consumer can use for the same purpose. In this case, both public transport and cars satisfy the need for transportation. The relationship between substitute goods is such that an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in the demand for its substitute.\n\nWhen the price of public transport rises, it becomes a less attractive option for consumers relative to cars. As a result, some consumers will switch from using public transport to using cars. This change in consumer preference, driven by the price change of a related good, causes an increase in the demand for cars at every price level. This is represented graphically as a rightward shift in the demand curve for cars.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It will contract.**\n\nA contraction in demand refers to a decrease in the *quantity demanded* of a good, which is caused by an increase in the price *of that specific good*. This is represented by a movement upwards along a stationary demand curve. The scenario describes a change in the price of a substitute good (public transport), not a change in the price of cars. Therefore, the term 'contraction' is incorrect as it describes a different economic event.\n\n**B. It will extend.**\n\nAn extension (or expansion) in demand refers to an increase in the *quantity demanded* of a good, caused by a decrease in the price *of that specific good*. This is represented by a movement downwards along a stationary demand curve. The stimulus for the change in this question is a rise in the price of a substitute good, not a fall in the price of cars. This causes a shift in the entire demand curve, not a movement along it. Thus, 'extension' is not the correct concept.\n\n**C. It will decrease.**\n\nA decrease in demand for cars would occur if cars became less desirable at every price level, causing the entire demand curve to shift to the left. This would happen, for example, if the price of a substitute good like public transport *fell*, making it a more attractive option. However, the question states that the price of public transport has *risen*, which makes cars a more attractive alternative, leading to an increase, not a decrease, in demand."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_276.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "6 the markets of four products are all in equilibrium. the table gives the value of the price elasticity\nof supply (pes) for each product.\nthe demand for each product shifts to the right by 5000 units at all prices.\nwhich product will have the largest price increase?\nprice elasticity\nof supply\n\na 0\n\nb 0.6\n\ncc 1.0\n\nd 2.5", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPrice elasticity of supply (PES) measures how responsive the quantity supplied of a good is to a change in its price. The magnitude of the price change following a shift in demand is determined by the PES.\n\nA PES of 0 means that supply is **perfectly inelastic**. This signifies that the quantity supplied is fixed and cannot be increased, regardless of how high the price rises. On a supply and demand diagram, a perfectly inelastic supply curve is a vertical line.\n\nWhen demand increases (the demand curve shifts to the right), it creates a situation of excess demand at the original price. Since suppliers are unable to produce more, the entire pressure of the increased demand falls on the price. The price must rise significantly to ration the fixed quantity of the product among the greater number of consumers who now want to buy it. Therefore, a product with perfectly inelastic supply will experience the largest price increase when demand rises.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: 0.6**\n\nA PES of 0.6 indicates that supply is **price inelastic** (PES is less than 1). This means that producers will increase the quantity they supply in response to a price rise, but the percentage increase in quantity will be smaller than the percentage increase in price. Because producers can respond to some extent by increasing output, the price does not need to rise as much as it would if supply were perfectly fixed (PES=0). Therefore, the price increase for this product will be substantial, but smaller than that for product A.\n\n**C: 1.0**\n\nA PES of 1.0 indicates **unit elastic supply**. Here, the percentage change in quantity supplied is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. Producers are more responsive to price changes than in the inelastic case. When demand increases, a rise in price will lead to a proportional increase in quantity supplied. This supply response helps to meet the new demand, dampening the necessary price increase. Consequently, the price will rise by less than it would for products with inelastic supply (A and B).\n\n**D: 2.5**\n\nA PES of 2.5 indicates that supply is **price elastic** (PES is greater than 1). This means producers are very responsive to price changes. A small increase in price will lead to a much larger percentage increase in the quantity supplied. When demand shifts to the right, producers can easily and quickly increase output to meet the new demand with only a small price incentive. As a result, most of the adjustment to the new equilibrium comes from an increase in quantity, and the price increase will be the smallest of all the options."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_277.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "7 whatis the value of the price elasticity of demand (ped) for a product if total revenue remains the\nsame when the price is reduced?\na zero\nb_ between 0 and 1\nc greater than 1\nd1", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D. 1\n\nThe value of the price elasticity of demand (PED) is 1 when total revenue remains unchanged following a price change.

This is often referred to as the price mechanism. Demand represents the quantity of a product that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices, while supply represents the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell. The equilibrium price is established where the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers.\n\nAny factor that changes the conditions of demand (e.g., changes in consumer income, tastes, or the price of related goods) or the conditions of supply (e.g., changes in production costs, technology, or the number of firms) will shift the respective curves. This shift results in a new equilibrium point, leading to a change in the market price of the product.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B) changes in external costs and external benefits**\n\nExternal costs (negative externalities) and external benefits (positive externalities) are consequences of an economic activity that affect third parties not directly involved in the transaction. For example, pollution from a factory is an external cost. In a pure free market, the price of a product only reflects the private costs of production and the private benefits of consumption. Externalities are typically ignored by the price mechanism, leading to market failure. Therefore, changes in external costs or benefits do not directly cause a change in the market price, although they may prompt government intervention to correct the market failure.\n\n**C) changes in government decisions**\n\nA free market economy is characterised by minimal government intervention. Prices are determined by the independent decisions of firms and consumers. While government decisions, such as imposing taxes, granting subsidies, or setting price controls, do cause changes in prices, these actions represent a move away from a free market system towards a mixed or command economy. The fundamental driver of price changes *within a free market framework* is the interplay of demand and supply, not government decrees.\n\n**D) changes in the quantity of public goods**\n\nPublic goods are goods or services that are non-excludable (it is not possible to prevent individuals from using them) and non-rivalrous (one person's use does not diminish another's). Examples include national defence and street lighting. Due to these characteristics, it is not profitable for private firms to provide public goods, as they cannot effectively charge a price for them (this is known as the free-rider problem). Consequently, public goods are typically provided by the government and are not sold in a free market.

While inflation erodes the real value (purchasing power) of all earnings, it is a macroeconomic phenomenon that affects the entire economy. It does not, by itself, create differences in the nominal earnings *between* individual pilots or groups of pilots within the same country. All pilots in that country face the same national rate of inflation. Therefore, it is not a factor that explains why one pilot earns more than another.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. bargaining power of employees:** Differences in the bargaining power of employees are a significant reason for variations in earnings. Pilots who are members of strong, well-organised trade unions can engage in collective bargaining to negotiate higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. Pilots at an airline with a powerful union may earn substantially more than pilots with similar experience at an airline with a weaker or non-existent union.\n\n**B. discrimination:** Discrimination in the labour market occurs when individuals with the same level of productivity are paid different wages based on non-economic characteristics such as gender, race, age, or religion. If an airline were to pay female pilots less than male pilots for the same role and experience, or offer fewer opportunities for promotion to certain groups, this would directly cause differences in earnings.\n\n**C. government policies:** Government policies can directly and indirectly create differences in earnings. For example, governments may set different regulations for national carriers versus budget airlines, which can affect their cost structures and ability to pay high salaries. Anti-discrimination laws can reduce earnings differences, while tax policies can affect the net (after-tax) earnings of different income brackets, creating disparities in disposable income. Regulations concerning maximum flight hours or mandatory retirement ages can also affect the lifetime earnings potential of pilots differently."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_284.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "14 anairline takes over an online clothing company.\nwhat is an advantage of such a move by the airline?\na to diversify their operations\nb_ to generate economies of scale\nc_ to improve lines of communication\nd_toincrease market share", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: A**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis takeover is an example of conglomerate integration, where a firm merges with or acquires another firm in a completely different industry. The primary advantage of this strategy is **diversification**. By operating in both the airline and online clothing industries, the company spreads its risk. If the airline industry faces a downturn (e.g., due to rising fuel prices or travel restrictions), the revenue from the clothing company might remain stable or even grow, cushioning the overall business from financial shocks. This creates a more balanced portfolio of business activities.\n\n---\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**B. to generate economies of scale**\nEconomies of scale are cost reductions that occur when a company increases its scale of production. They are typically achieved when firms in the same or related industries merge (horizontal or vertical integration), allowing them to share resources, bulk buy, or streamline production. An airline and a clothing company have vastly different operations, technologies, and supply chains. There is little to no overlap that would allow them to reduce the average cost of producing either air travel or clothing, making significant economies of scale highly unlikely.\n\n**C. to improve lines of communication**\nA takeover, especially of a firm in an unrelated industry, tends to make the overall organisation larger and more complex. This complexity often complicates lines of communication rather than improving them. Integrating different corporate cultures, management systems, and operational processes across distinct industries presents a significant communication challenge.\n\n**D. to increase market share**\nMarket share refers to a company's proportion of total sales within a specific market. By acquiring a clothing company, the airline is entering a *new* market, not increasing its share of the *airline market*. While the new, larger entity will have a presence in the clothing market, this move does not strengthen its competitive position against other airlines.

A monopolist is the sole supplier in the market, giving it significant market power to set prices. This allows the firm to earn large supernormal profits in the short run by producing at a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, and setting a price on the demand curve that is well above its average total cost.\n\nCritically, the high barriers to entry prevent new firms from entering the industry, even in the long run, despite the attraction of these large profits. These barriers could include patents, control of a key resource, significant economies of scale, or government regulations. Because potential competitors are kept out of the market, the monopolist can sustain these large supernormal profits indefinitely into the long run.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** An industry with many firms and high barriers to entry describes an oligopoly. While the high barriers to entry can allow firms to earn supernormal profits in the long run, the presence of \"many\" (or at least a few) competing firms means that each firm's ability to make a *large* profit is constrained by the actions of its rivals. Competition, even amongst a few firms, tends to reduce prices and profits compared to a pure monopoly situation.\n\n**B:** An industry with many firms and low barriers to entry describes either perfect competition or monopolistic competition. In these market structures, a firm might make a large profit in the short run. However, these profits act as a signal to new entrepreneurs. Due to the low barriers to entry, new firms will enter the market, increasing the total market supply. This increased competition drives down the market price, eroding the supernormal profits of all firms. In the long run, firms in such an industry can only expect to make normal profit (breaking even).\n\n**D:** An industry with one firm but low barriers to entry describes a contestable market. While there is only one firm at present, the lack of entry barriers means it is constantly under threat from potential competition. If the incumbent firm were to make large profits, new firms would quickly enter the market to take a share of those profits. To prevent this, the existing firm may deliberately keep its prices and profits low (a practice called limit pricing) to deter entry.

Macroeconomic policy focuses on aggregate economic variables such as national output, unemployment, and the overall price level (inflation). Increasing the money supply is a primary tool of monetary policy, which is implemented by a country's central bank. By increasing the amount of money in circulation, the government aims to stimulate aggregate demand, which can lead to economic growth and lower unemployment. However, it can also lead to higher inflation. Because this policy affects the entire economy rather than a single market, it is a macroeconomic policy.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**B. preventing price rises in the food industry**\nThis is an example of microeconomic policy, not macroeconomic policy. Microeconomics deals with the behaviour of individual firms, consumers, and specific markets or industries. A policy that targets price changes within a single industry\u2014in this case, the food industry\u2014is a microeconomic intervention. Such a policy, like a price control, is designed to affect the supply and demand conditions within that particular market, not to manage the overall economy.\n\n**C. removing a monopoly's barriers to entry**\nThis is a microeconomic policy related to competition or anti-trust regulation. It focuses on the structure and competitiveness of a specific market dominated by a single firm (a monopoly). By removing barriers to entry, the government aims to increase competition, which can lead to lower prices, better quality, and more choice for consumers within that particular market. This action is targeted at a specific market structure, not the economy as a whole, and is therefore a microeconomic policy.\n\n**D. setting a maximum price for wheat**\nThis is a microeconomic policy tool known as a price ceiling. A maximum price is a government-imposed limit on how high a price can be charged for a specific good or service. In this case, the policy targets the market for a single commodity: wheat.

This makes the country's exports less expensive for foreign buyers. According to the law of demand, a lower price for these goods and services will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded by foreign consumers and businesses. To meet this rising foreign demand, domestic firms will need to increase their output. The expansion of production requires hiring more labour, which directly leads to a reduction in unemployment. This increase in net exports (exports minus imports) is a key component of aggregate demand, and its growth stimulates the entire economy.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. Devaluing the currency would increase the cost of production.**\nThis statement is often true, but it explains a potential negative consequence of devaluation, not why it would reduce unemployment. A weaker currency makes imported raw materials, components, and capital goods more expensive for domestic firms. This increase in the cost of production could lead to cost-push inflation and may cause firms to reduce output or lay off workers to maintain profitability. Therefore, this effect would work against the goal of reducing unemployment, rather than helping to achieve it.\n\n**B. Devaluing the currency would increase the confidence of investors.**\nThis is incorrect. A currency devaluation is often perceived as a sign of economic weakness or instability. It can signal to both foreign and domestic investors that the economy is struggling. Foreign investors would see the value of their investments in the country decrease when converted back to their own currency. This uncertainty and reduction in potential returns are more likely to decrease investor confidence, potentially leading to capital flight, which would harm the economy further.\n\n**D. Devaluing the currency would increase the demand for imports.**\nThis statement is the opposite of what occurs. Devaluing the domestic currency makes foreign currencies more expensive. Consequently, the price of imported goods and services rises for domestic consumers. Following the law of demand, a higher price for imports will lead to a decrease, not an increase, in the quantity demanded. Consumers are likely to substitute expensive imports with cheaper, domestically produced goods, which further helps to boost domestic production and employment."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_289.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 what is likely to happen when the rate of interest increases?\na consumer spending increases\nb _ firms buy fewer machines\nc people hold more cash\nd savers earn lower rewards", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. firms buy fewer machines**\n\nAn increase in the rate of interest raises the cost of borrowing for firms. Firms often take out loans to finance investment in capital goods, such as new machinery and equipment. When interest rates are higher, the cost of servicing these loans increases, which reduces the potential profitability of new investment projects. Consequently, firms are less willing and able to borrow, leading to a decrease in investment and the purchase of fewer machines.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. consumer spending increases**\n\nThis is incorrect. A higher interest rate makes it more expensive for consumers to borrow money for large purchases (e.g., using credit cards or taking out loans for cars). This discourages borrowing and spending. Additionally, a higher interest rate increases the reward for saving, providing an incentive for consumers to save more of their income rather than spend it. Both effects lead to a likely *decrease*, not an increase, in consumer spending.\n\n**C. people hold more cash**\n\nThis is incorrect. The interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding cash. Holding physical cash earns no interest. When the rate of interest increases, the potential reward for depositing money into a savings account becomes greater. Therefore, people have a stronger incentive to save their money in a bank to earn higher returns, rather than holding it as cash. This leads to people holding *less* cash.\n\n**D. savers earn lower rewards**\n\nThis is incorrect. The rate of interest is the return, or reward, that savers receive for depositing their money in a financial institution like a bank. An increase in the rate of interest means that for every unit of currency saved, the saver will receive a larger return. Therefore, an increase in the interest rate leads to savers earning *higher*, not lower, rewards."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_290.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is not a supply-side policy measure?\na control of trade union power\nb _ higher indirect taxation\nc privatisation\nd \u00a9 skills training for workers", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nHigher indirect taxation is a measure of fiscal policy, which is primarily used to influence aggregate demand or raise government revenue. Supply-side policies are intended to increase the economy's productive potential by improving the efficiency and flexibility of markets. An increase in indirect taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or excise duties, raises the costs of production for firms. This typically leads to a decrease in short-run aggregate supply (a leftward shift of the SRAS curve) as firms are willing to supply less at any given price level. Therefore, it is not a supply-side measure designed to boost the economy's long-term output.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. control of trade union power**\nThis is a supply-side policy. Policies that reduce the power of trade unions are a form of labour market reform. The aim is to make the labour market more flexible and competitive. By limiting the ability of unions to demand higher wages or resist changes in working practices, these policies can reduce firms' labour costs and increase their willingness to hire more workers. Lower production costs and a more flexible workforce can lead to an increase in the economy's aggregate supply.\n\n**C. privatisation**\nThis is a supply-side policy. Privatisation involves transferring state-owned assets and industries to the private sector. The economic argument is that private firms, driven by the profit motive and facing competition, operate more efficiently, innovate more, and reduce costs compared to state-run monopolies. This increase in efficiency and productivity across privatised sectors boosts the overall productive capacity of the economy, thus increasing long-run aggregate supply.\n\n**D. skills training for workers**\nThis is a key supply-side policy. Government investment in education and vocational training programs aims to improve the skills and quality of the labour force, a concept known as increasing human capital. A more skilled and educated workforce is more productive, meaning it can produce more output per worker.

Real GDP per head is a primary indicator of the average material standard of living. When it increases, it means that, on average, each citizen has access to more goods and services.

Incomes were distributed more evenly.**\nReal GDP per head is an average figure calculated by dividing the total real GDP by the population. It provides no information about how income is distributed among the population. The increase in the average could be a result of the wealthiest individuals becoming much richer while others' incomes stagnate or even fall. Therefore, we cannot conclude that income distribution has become more even; it may have become less even.\n\n**B. There was more activity in the informal economy.**\nGDP figures measure the value of goods and services produced in the formal, officially recorded economy. The informal economy (or shadow economy) consists of economic transactions that are not officially recorded, taxed, or monitored by the government.

A budget deficit occurs when government spending exceeds tax revenue. To increase the deficit, the government can either increase its spending, decrease taxation, or implement a combination of both.\n\n*   **Increased Government Spending:** This directly boosts aggregate demand (AD), as government spending (G) is a key component of AD (AD = C + I + G + X - M).\n*   **Decreased Taxation:** Lowering taxes increases the disposable income of households and the post-tax profits of firms. This encourages higher consumption (C) and investment (I), which also increases aggregate demand.\n\nBy increasing aggregate demand, firms are incentivised to increase production to meet the higher demand for goods and services.

Increasing a surplus involves either raising taxes or cutting government spending. Both of these actions are contractionary, reducing aggregate demand in the economy. A fall in aggregate demand would lead to lower production and an increase in cyclical unemployment.\n\n*   **D. increasing the money supply:** This is a tool of **monetary policy**, not fiscal policy. Monetary policy is managed by the central bank and involves changes to the money supply and interest rates.

Purchasing power refers to the quantity of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. There is an inverse relationship between the price level and the purchasing power of money. If prices double, each unit of currency can now buy only half the amount of goods and services it could before. For example, if $1 could buy a loaf of bread at the beginning of the year, after 100% inflation, that same loaf of bread would cost $2. Consequently, the original $1 can now only purchase half a loaf of bread, meaning its purchasing power has halved. This is a direct and defining consequence of a 100% inflation rate.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. The money supply doubled.**\nWhile a significant increase in the money supply can be a major cause of inflation (a concept described by the Quantity Theory of Money), it is not a guaranteed outcome or a definition of inflation itself. Inflation can also be caused by other factors, such as demand-pull inflation (where aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply) or cost-push inflation (where the costs of production rise). Furthermore, a doubling of the money supply might not lead to a 100% inflation rate if, for example, the economy's real output also grows. Therefore, a doubling of the money supply is a possible cause, not something that *must* have happened.\n\n**B. The price level halved.**\nThis is the opposite of what occurs during inflation. Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general price level. An inflation rate of 100% specifically means the price level has doubled. A halving of the price level would be described as deflation, which is a negative inflation rate.\n\n**D. The real value of money doubled.**\nThe \"real value of money\" is another term for its purchasing power. As explained for the correct answer, when the price level doubles (100% inflation), the real value or purchasing power of money is halved because each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. A doubling of the real value of money would only occur if the price level halved (i.e., during significant deflation)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_294.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 the human development index (hdi) can be used to measure human development in countries.\nwhich measure would not be part of its calculation?\na inequality of incomes\nb life expectancy\nc gross national income per head\nd years of schooling", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: A**\n\nThe standard Human Development Index (HDI) does not include a measure of income inequality in its calculation.

A separate, complementary measure, the Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), was introduced to account for such disparities.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B:** Life expectancy is a core component of the HDI. It is the primary indicator used to measure the health and longevity dimension of human development. A higher average life expectancy at birth contributes positively to a country's HDI score.\n*   **C:** Gross National Income (GNI) per head (or per capita) is the specific measure used for the standard of living dimension of the HDI. It reflects the average income per person in a country and is used as a proxy for the resources available to individuals to lead a decent life.\n*   **D:** Years of schooling is a central part of the education dimension of the HDI. This dimension is measured by two indicators: the mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and older, and the expected years of schooling for children of school-entering age. Both are direct measures of educational attainment and access."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_295.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 what is the most likely consequence of an ageing population for a high-income economy?\na there will be a fall in the dependency ratio.\nb_ there will be a fall in the level of immigration.\nc_ there will be an increase in geographic mobility.\nd_ there will be an increase in spending on healthcare.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn ageing population is characterised by a rising proportion of older people (typically aged 65 and over). Older individuals, on average, require more healthcare services than younger individuals due to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and age-related health conditions. As the elderly population grows, the overall demand for medical care, prescription drugs, long-term care facilities, and other health services increases significantly. Consequently, both government and private expenditure on healthcare will rise to meet this increased demand.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. There will be a fall in the dependency ratio.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The dependency ratio measures the proportion of dependents (those typically under 15 and over 64) relative to the working-age population (15-64). An ageing population means there is an increase in the number of people aged 65 and over, who are part of the dependent population. This will cause the dependency ratio to *increase*, not fall, placing a greater financial burden on the working population to support pensions and healthcare.\n\n**B. There will be a fall in the level of immigration.**\n\nThis is unlikely. An ageing population often leads to a shrinking domestic workforce and a smaller tax base. To counteract these effects and fill labour shortages, governments in high-income economies may actively encourage immigration, particularly of skilled, working-age people. These immigrants contribute to the economy through their labour and by paying taxes, which helps fund social services for the elderly. Therefore, immigration levels are more likely to increase or be maintained through policy, rather than fall.\n\n**C. There will be an increase in geographic mobility.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Geographic mobility, which is the movement of people from one location to another, tends to be higher among younger, working-age individuals who move for education or career opportunities. Older populations, especially retirees, are generally less geographically mobile. They are more likely to have established homes, community ties, and may face health constraints that limit their ability or desire to relocate. An increase in the proportion of elderly people would therefore lead to a *decrease* in the overall geographic mobility of the population."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_296.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 in some developing countries a large percentage of the population is involved in subsistence\nfarming.\nwhat can be concluded from this?\na_ each family will be able to produce enough to live on.\nb production is unlikely to be capital intensive.\nc production will be efficient.\nd_ there will be a high level of trade.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. Production is unlikely to be capital intensive.**\n\nSubsistence farming is a system where farmers focus on growing enough food to feed themselves and their families. This type of agriculture is characteristic of economies with limited access to financial resources and advanced technology. Production that is **capital-intensive** relies heavily on machinery, equipment, and technology (capital) rather than on human effort (labour).\n\nIn the context of subsistence farming in developing countries, several factors make capital-intensive methods unlikely:\n*   **Lack of Finance:** Subsistence farmers typically have very low incomes and limited or no access to credit, making it impossible to purchase expensive capital goods like tractors, combine harvesters, or sophisticated irrigation systems.\n*   **Small Scale of Operation:** Farms are often small and fragmented, which means large machinery would be impractical and uneconomical to use.\n*   **Abundant Labour:** In many developing countries, labour is a relatively abundant and cheap factor of production.\n\nTherefore, subsistence farming is almost always **labour-intensive**, relying on the physical work of the family and the use of simple, traditional tools. It is a direct and logical conclusion that this form of production is unlikely to be capital-intensive.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Each family will be able to produce enough to live on.**\n\nThis statement is an assumption, not a certain conclusion. While the goal of subsistence farming is to produce enough for survival, farmers are highly vulnerable to factors beyond their control. Poor weather conditions (such as drought or floods), crop diseases, and pest infestations can lead to crop failure. In such cases, a family may not produce enough to live on, leading to malnutrition and food insecurity.\n\n**C. Production will be efficient.**\n\nThis is incorrect. Economic efficiency, particularly productive efficiency, involves achieving the maximum output from a given amount of inputs. Subsistence farming is generally characterised by low productivity and inefficiency. The lack of capital, modern farming techniques (like high-yield seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides), and the absence of economies of scale mean that output per worker and per unit of land is typically very low compared to commercial, capital-intensive agriculture.\n\n**D. There will be a high level of trade.**\n\nThis statement contradicts the definition of subsistence farming. Trade requires a surplus\u2014producing more than one needs for personal consumption to sell or exchange for other goods. Since subsistence farmers produce primarily for their own family's needs, there is little or no surplus left over for trade. An economy where a large part of the population is engaged in subsistence farming will, by definition, have a low level of specialisation and market activity, resulting in a low, not high, level of trade."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_297.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 asmall country whose only export is oil decides to reduce substantially the rate at which it extracts\nits limited oil reserves.\nwhat is the most likely reason for this decision?\na to improve the balance of payments in the following year\nb to increase current government income\nc to maintain future living standards\nd to raise the level of employment in the oil industry", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe question describes a country whose economy is entirely dependent on a single, non-renewable resource: oil. The key information is that the oil reserves are \"limited,\" meaning they will eventually run out. The decision to reduce the rate of extraction is a long-term strategy focused on resource conservation. By extracting the oil more slowly, the country ensures that this vital source of income will last for a longer period. This helps to secure the economic well-being and living standards of future generations, who would otherwise face a sudden and catastrophic loss of national income once the oil is depleted. This policy is an example of sustainable economic management, prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: to improve the balance of payments in the following year**\nThis is incorrect. The balance of payments current account records the value of exports and imports. Since oil is the country's only export, reducing the rate at which it is extracted and sold will decrease the volume of exports. Assuming the global oil price does not rise significantly as a result of this small country's action, the total revenue from exports will fall. A fall in export revenue would worsen the balance of payments position, not improve it.\n\n**B: to increase current government income**\nThis is incorrect. Government income in an oil-exporting nation is heavily reliant on revenue from oil sales, either through taxes on oil companies or direct profits from a state-owned enterprise. By reducing the rate of extraction, the country is selling less oil in the current period. This will lead to a decrease in the government's current income, not an increase. The country is accepting lower income now in exchange for future economic security.\n\n**D: to raise the level of employment in the oil industry**\nThis is incorrect. The level of employment in an industry is linked to its level of production and activity. Reducing the rate of oil extraction means less drilling, pumping, and related operational activities are required. This would lead to a decrease in the demand for labour in the oil industry, potentially causing layoffs or reduced hiring, rather than an increase in employment."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_298.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 country x believes that country y is selling steel at prices below the average cost of production.\nso, country x imposes a higher tariff on steel imports from country y.\nwhat does country x hope to achieve by imposing this higher tariff?\na avoid country x dumping steel in country y\nb_ avoid country y dumping steel in country x\nc_ reduce inflation in country x\nd_ reduce inflation in country y", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B) avoid country Y dumping steel in country X**\n\nDumping is an international trade practice where a country or company exports a product at a price that is lower in the foreign importing market than the price in the exporter's domestic market, often below the cost of production. This is considered an unfair trade practice because it can harm producers in the importing country (Country X) by making it difficult for them to compete with the artificially low prices.\n\nTo counteract this, the government of the importing country (Country X) can impose an anti-dumping tariff. A tariff is a tax on imported goods. By levying a higher tariff on steel from Country Y, Country X raises the price of the imported steel within its own market. This action makes the dumped goods more expensive, thereby levelling the playing field for domestic steel producers and mitigating the negative effects of dumping. The primary goal is to protect the domestic industry from what is perceived as predatory pricing by foreign competitors.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A) avoid country X dumping steel in country Y**\n\nThis option misinterprets the situation described. The scenario states that Country Y is the one allegedly dumping steel into Country X's market. Country X is the importing country that is imposing the tariff as a protective measure. Therefore, the policy is designed to prevent dumping *in* Country X, not by Country X.\n\n**C) reduce inflation in country X**\n\nA tariff is a tax that increases the price of imported goods. By imposing a tariff on steel, Country X makes imported steel more expensive for its domestic consumers and businesses. This increases the cost of production for industries that use steel as a raw material (e.g., construction, car manufacturing). These higher costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices for a range of goods. Consequently, a tariff is more likely to cause or worsen inflation (a general increase in prices) in Country X, rather than reduce it.\n\n**D) reduce inflation in country Y**\n\nA tariff is a trade policy tool implemented by an importing country to affect its own domestic market. While the tariff imposed by Country X will reduce the quantity of steel that Country Y can export to Country X, the primary objective is not to influence the internal economic conditions, such as the inflation rate, of Country Y. The main goal is to protect Country X's domestic producers.

To purchase goods and services from other countries (imports), domestic residents must exchange their own currency for foreign currency. This action increases the supply of the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market. According to the laws of supply and demand, an increase in the supply of a currency, assuming demand remains constant, will lead to a decrease in its price. The price of a currency on the foreign exchange market is its exchange rate. Therefore, an increased demand for imports leads to a depreciation (a fall) in the exchange rate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Domestic interest rates rise.**\nA rise in domestic interest rates would likely cause the exchange rate to rise, not fall. Higher interest rates offer a better return on savings. This attracts foreign investors and savers to deposit their money in the country's banks, a phenomenon often referred to as 'hot money' flows. To do this, foreigners must first purchase the domestic currency, which increases the demand for it on the foreign exchange market. An increase in demand for the currency will cause its value, or exchange rate, to appreciate (rise).\n\n**C. Domestic savings increase.**\nAn increase in domestic savings, on its own, is more likely to cause the exchange rate to rise rather than fall. Higher savings mean lower consumption spending. This reduction in spending would likely include a decrease in spending on imported goods. A lower demand for imports means that fewer people are selling the domestic currency to buy foreign currency. This reduces the supply of the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market, causing the exchange rate to appreciate (rise).\n\n**D. More tourists visit the country.**\nAn increase in the number of tourists visiting the country would cause the exchange rate to rise, not fall. Tourism is a form of export (an invisible export). When foreign tourists come to a country, they must purchase the domestic currency to pay for accommodation, food, and other goods and services. This increases the demand for the domestic currency on the foreign exchange market. An increase in demand for the currency leads to an appreciation (a rise) in its exchange rate."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_300.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "30 many european firms employ workers from the philippines. these workers send part of their income\nto relatives in the philippines.\nin which part of the balance of payments current account for the philippines would these transactions\nbe recorded?\na primary income\nb_ secondary income\nc trade in goods\nd trade in services", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nSecondary income, also known as current transfers, records one-way transactions where no goods, services, or factors of production are exchanged.

For the Philippines, this inflow of funds from abroad represents a credit on the secondary income component of its current account.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: primary income**\nPrimary income refers to income earned from the factors of production (labour, land, capital, enterprise). This includes wages, salaries, profits, interest, and dividends earned by a country's residents from abroad, or paid by a country's residents to non-residents.

The scenario described focuses on a single consumer's inability to afford goods due to a personal budget constraint, not a market-wide imbalance between total demand and total supply.\n\n**B. free goods**\nFree goods are resources that are not scarce, meaning they are so abundant that they are available to everyone without limit (e.g., air).

By choosing to produce at point Y instead of point X, the country is prioritising immediate consumption and an increase in the current standard of living over the production of capital goods.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** An increase in investment in technology would improve the efficiency of production for one or both types of goods. This would increase the country's productive capacity, causing the entire PPC to shift outwards. A movement from X to Y occurs on the *same* PPC, indicating that the country's productive potential has not changed, only the combination of goods being produced.\n\n**B:** The discovery of new economic resources, such as new oil fields or a larger labour force, increases the total factors of production available to a country.

The movement from X to Y is a reallocation of existing resources along a fixed PPC.\n\n**D:** Long-term economic growth is achieved by increasing an economy's productive capacity. A key way to do this is by investing in capital goods (e.g., machinery, factories, infrastructure), as these goods are used to produce other goods and services in the future.

This imbalance creates one of two situations:\n\n1.  **Excess Supply (Surplus):** This occurs when the quantity supplied by producers is greater than the quantity demanded by consumers (Qs > Qd). A surplus typically happens when the market price is set above the equilibrium price, leading to unsold goods.\n2.  **Excess Demand (Shortage):** This occurs when the quantity demanded by consumers is greater than the quantity supplied by producers (Qd > Qs).

Markets in disequilibrium still function, and transactions still occur. For example, in a situation of excess supply, producers will still sell some of their goods, just not all of them. Market forces, often referred to as the price mechanism, will naturally push a market towards equilibrium without government intervention.

In fact, changes (or shifts) in the demand or supply curves are a primary cause of market disequilibrium. For instance, if consumer incomes rise, the demand curve will shift to the right, creating a temporary state of excess demand (a shortage) at the original price.

PED measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in the product's price. If a product is a necessity (e.g., essential food, medicine), consumers will continue to purchase it even if the price increases significantly, as they cannot easily go without it. This results in price inelastic demand (PED < 1). Conversely, if a product is a luxury (e.g., a sports car, a designer watch), consumers can easily forgo or postpone its purchase if the price rises. This results in price elastic demand (PED > 1).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: availability of stocks of the product**\nThis is a determinant of the **price elasticity of supply (PES)**, not the price elasticity of demand. PES measures how responsive the quantity supplied is to a change in price. If a firm has large stocks of a product, it can quickly increase the amount it offers for sale when the price rises, making the supply more price elastic. The level of stock held by producers does not directly influence how consumers' demand responds to a price change.\n\n**B: change in the income of consumers**\nA change in consumer income affects the overall demand for a product, causing the demand curve to shift. The responsiveness of demand to a change in income is measured by **income elasticity of demand (YED)**, not PED. PED measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in the good's own price, which is represented by a movement *along* a given demand curve.\n\n**D: existence of monopoly**\nThe existence of a monopoly is a type of market structure. While it is true that a firm in a monopoly market typically faces a price inelastic demand curve, this is because a key determinant of PED \u2013 the **availability of close substitutes** \u2013 is absent. The market structure itself (monopoly) is a consequence of having no substitutes, rather than being the fundamental determinant.

This improvement, often driven by new technology, better farming techniques, or more favourable weather, lowers the average cost of producing each unit of the agricultural product. With lower production costs, farming becomes more profitable at any given price. This incentivises existing farms to produce more and may attract new farms to the market. As a result, the total quantity supplied at every price level increases, which is represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an increase in the costs of production**\nAn increase in the costs of production, such as higher prices for fertiliser, seeds, fuel, or labour, makes it more expensive to grow the agricultural product. This reduces the profitability of production at any given price. Consequently, farms will supply a smaller quantity at each price level, leading to a decrease in overall supply. A decrease in supply is represented graphically by a shift of the supply curve to the left, not to the right.\n\n**B. an increase in the price of substitutes**\nThis refers to an increase in the price of a substitute in production\u2014another crop a farmer could grow using the same resources. For example, if the price of maize increases, a farmer who can grow both wheat and maize might find it more profitable to allocate more land and resources to growing maize. This would reduce the amount of wheat they are willing to supply at any given price. Therefore, an increase in the price of a substitute product would cause the supply of the original good to decrease, shifting its supply curve to the left.\n\n**C. an increase in the price of the good**\nA change in the price of the good itself does not cause the supply curve to shift. Instead, it causes a movement *along* the existing supply curve. The supply curve illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity producers are willing to supply. An increase in the price of the good leads to an increase in the *quantity supplied* (a movement up along the curve), as producers are more incentivised to sell at a higher price.

An increase in the time a product can be stored makes its supply more price elastic. If a product is not perishable and can be held in inventory, producers can respond to a price increase by immediately supplying more to the market from their existing stocks. This allows for a significant and rapid increase in the quantity supplied without needing to alter production levels immediately. Conversely, if a product is highly perishable and cannot be stored, its supply is more inelastic because producers can only supply what they can produce in that period.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. an increase in the cost of inputs:** An increase in the cost of inputs, such as raw materials or labour, would make it more expensive for a firm to produce each unit. This would likely make the supply *less* elastic. If the market price of the product rises, the higher production costs would limit the firm's ability and incentive to significantly increase its output, making the quantity supplied less responsive to the price change.\n\n**B. an increase in the firm's profits:** An increase in a firm's profits is an outcome of its operations (revenue minus costs), not a direct determinant of the price elasticity of supply. While sustained high profits might enable a firm to invest in expanding its production capacity in the long run (which would eventually make supply more elastic), a simple increase in profits does not change the immediate responsiveness of quantity supplied to a price change.\n\n**C. an increase in the number of close substitutes:** The number of close substitutes available for a product is a key determinant of its **price elasticity of demand (PED)**, not its price elasticity of supply (PES). PED measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a price change. While substitutes are crucial for consumer choice, they do not affect a producer's ability to alter their production levels in response to a price change for their own product."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_308.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "8 the diagram shows a demand curve.\nprice\npeas\npapo\na d\no -. 6\nquantity\nwhat does the movement from x to y show?\na adecrease in quantity demanded due to an increase in price\nb_ adecrease in quantity demanded due to changes in the conditions of demand\nc_anincrease in quantity demanded due to changes in the conditions of demand\nd_anincrease in quantity demanded due to an increase in price", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA movement along a demand curve represents a change in the quantity demanded in response to a change in the price of the good itself, with all other factors held constant (ceteris paribus).

The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus, an increase in the price of a good leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded. The movement from X to Y correctly illustrates this principle: as price rises from P\u2081 to P\u2082, quantity demanded falls from Q\u2081 to Q\u2082.

This situation arises when the price is set above the equilibrium price. To restore equilibrium, the market must eliminate this surplus. A fall in price is the mechanism that achieves this. According to the law of demand, a lower price will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded as the good becomes more affordable for consumers. Simultaneously, according to the law of supply, a lower price will lead to a decrease in the quantity supplied as production becomes less profitable for firms. The combination of rising quantity demanded and falling quantity supplied will continue until the surplus is cleared and the market reaches a new equilibrium point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a decrease in demand**\n\nA decrease in demand refers to a leftward shift of the entire demand curve, meaning consumers are willing to buy less of the good at every price level. If a market already has a surplus (where quantity supplied > quantity demanded), a further decrease in demand would only widen this gap, making the surplus larger. This would move the market further away from equilibrium, not towards it.\n\n**C: a rise in price**\n\nA rise in price would exacerbate a surplus. A higher price would cause the quantity demanded to decrease (as per the law of demand) and the quantity supplied to increase (as per the law of supply). This would make the difference between quantity supplied and quantity demanded even greater, thus increasing the surplus. A rise in price is the market mechanism for correcting a shortage (excess demand), not a surplus.\n\n**D: an increase in supply**\n\nAn increase in supply refers to a rightward shift of the entire supply curve, meaning producers are willing to sell more of the good at every price level.

The formula is:\nPED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)\n\nTo find the change in quantity demanded, we can rearrange this formula:\n% Change in Quantity Demanded = PED \u00d7 % Change in Price\n\nIn this case, the price falls from $10 to $9, which is a 10% decrease in price.

This is the largest increase among all the options. A higher PED signifies a greater responsiveness of quantity demanded to a price change, so for a given price fall, a higher PED will always result in a larger increase in quantity demanded.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** In this option, the price falls from $10 to $9, a 10% decrease. This will cause an increase in quantity demanded. However, the PED is 0.8 (inelastic demand). This means that the quantity demanded is relatively unresponsive to the price change. The resulting increase in quantity demanded would be 0.8 \u00d7 10% = 8%, or an increase of 8 units.

A reduction in this rate has two primary effects on individuals' financial decisions.\n\n1.  **Cost of Borrowing:** The interest rate is essentially the price of borrowing money. When the central bank reduces its policy rate, commercial banks typically follow by lowering the interest rates they charge on loans, mortgages, and credit cards. This makes borrowing cheaper for individuals, thus the cost of borrowing decreases.\n\n2.  **Amount Saved:** The interest rate also represents the reward for saving. When interest rates are reduced from 5% to 0.5%, individuals earn significantly less on their savings deposits. This lowers the incentive to save, as the return is minimal. Simultaneously, the opportunity cost of spending money now (instead of saving it) falls. As a result, individuals are encouraged to spend rather than save, leading to a decrease in the overall amount saved.\n\nTherefore, reducing the interest rate leads to a decrease in both the amount saved and the cost of borrowing.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B: decreased (amount saved), increased (cost of borrowing)**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the effect on the cost of borrowing. A reduction in the central bank's interest rate directly leads to a *decrease*, not an increase, in the interest rates charged by commercial banks on loans. Cheaper borrowing is a primary goal of this policy.\n\n**C: increased (amount saved), decreased (cost of borrowing)**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it misidentifies the effect on the amount saved. A lower interest rate reduces the financial reward for saving money. With a lower return on savings, the incentive for individuals to postpone consumption and save their money is weakened. This typically leads to a *decrease*, not an increase, in the amount saved.\n\n**D: increased (amount saved), increased (cost of borrowing)**\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. A reduction in the central bank's policy rate is designed to make borrowing cheaper, so the cost of borrowing *decreases*. Furthermore, this policy reduces the reward for saving, which discourages, rather than encourages, saving, causing the amount saved to *decrease*."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_313.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "13 many small energy providers have closed down due to rising costs.\nwhat is the likely effect of this on the price of energy and choice of energy providers for consumers,\nassuming there is no government intervention?\nprice of choice of\nenergy energy providers\na decreases decreases\nb decreases increases\ncc increases decreases\nd increases increases", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe closure of many energy providers leads to a decrease in the total market supply of energy. According to the law of supply, a reduction in supply, assuming demand remains constant, causes a leftward shift in the supply curve. This shift results in a higher equilibrium price for energy. Furthermore, the exit of firms from the market reduces competition. With fewer competing providers, the remaining firms gain more market power, which can enable them to increase prices. Simultaneously, the fact that providers have \"closed down\" means there are fewer firms for consumers to choose from, directly leading to a decrease in the choice of energy providers.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) price of energy decreases, choice of energy providers decreases**\nThis option is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that consumer choice will decrease, it incorrectly suggests that the price of energy will fall. A reduction in the number of suppliers leads to less competition and a lower overall market supply. Both of these factors put upward pressure on prices, not downward. A price decrease would typically be associated with an increase in supply or a fall in demand.\n\n**B) price of energy decreases, choice of energy providers increases**\nThis option is incorrect on both points. The closure of energy providers means there are fewer firms in the market, which leads to a decrease, not an increase, in consumer choice. Additionally, a reduction in the number of suppliers decreases market supply and competition, causing prices to rise, not decrease.\n\n**D) price of energy increases, choice of energy providers increases**\nThis option is incorrect because it wrongly states that the choice of energy providers will increase.

Unlike private sector firms, whose primary objective is typically profit maximisation, state-owned enterprises are established to provide goods and services that benefit society as a whole. Health services are a prime example of a merit good, where the social benefits of consumption exceed the private benefits. Therefore, the government provides these services to ensure they are accessible to all citizens, regardless of their ability to pay. The success of a public health service is measured by its ability to improve the health and well-being of the population, which is directly reflected in public satisfaction. This includes factors like accessibility, quality of care, and positive health outcomes.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. Profits:** Profit maximisation is the main objective of private sector businesses. A state-owned health service that prioritises profits would likely need to raise prices or cut costs, which could make healthcare unaffordable or reduce its quality. This would undermine the fundamental purpose of public healthcare, which is to ensure equitable access to essential services for the benefit of society. While a state-owned enterprise may aim to operate efficiently and minimise losses, generating profit is not its primary goal.\n\n**C. Sales Revenue:** Maximising sales revenue is a commercial objective focused on increasing the total income from sales. This is not a suitable goal for a state-owned health service, as many of its services are funded through taxation and provided free at the point of delivery or at a subsidised cost. A focus on revenue could incentivise the provision of more expensive treatments over more essential, cost-effective ones, conflicting with the goal of promoting overall public health.\n\n**D. Survival:** While any organisation must survive to achieve its objectives, survival is a basic prerequisite rather than the primary goal. For a state-owned enterprise, survival is generally secured by government funding and support, as it exists to fulfil a public need mandated by government policy.

These large profits can be reinvested into research and development (R&D). In certain industries, such as pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and technology, the costs of innovation are prohibitively high. The prospect of earning monopoly profits, often protected temporarily by government-issued patents, provides a powerful incentive for firms to undertake these expensive and risky R&D projects. The resulting innovations can lead to new products, improved production techniques, and long-term benefits for the entire economy, justifying the government's decision to allow the monopoly.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. to attract entry into the market**\nThis is incorrect. A defining characteristic of a monopoly is the presence of high barriers to entry, which prevent new firms from competing with the single, dominant firm. Allowing a monopoly to exist inherently discourages, rather than attracts, market entry. Governments seeking to increase competition and attract new firms would pursue policies that dismantle monopolies and lower barriers to entry.\n\n**C. to increase prices for consumers**\nThis is incorrect. A government's economic objectives typically include protecting consumer welfare and ensuring affordability. Monopolies often use their market power to charge higher prices than would be found in a competitive market. This is viewed as a significant disadvantage of monopolies and a form of market failure. Therefore, a government would not allow a monopoly for the purpose of raising prices; rather, this is an undesirable outcome that it may seek to control through regulation, such as price capping.\n\n**D. to maximise monopoly profits**\nThis is incorrect. The goal of profit maximisation belongs to the private firm, not the government. A government's role is to manage the economy for the benefit of society as a whole. While a government might tolerate the high profits of a monopoly as a side effect of achieving another goal (like funding R&D), it is not the government's objective to help a private firm maximise its profits, especially as this often comes at the expense of consumer surplus and overall economic efficiency."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_316.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "16 the table shows the costs incurred by a firm producing computers.\noutput total costs\n(thousands) ($ thousands)\n0 20\n1 1200\n2 1350\n3 1450\nwhat are the fixed costs if 3000 computers are produced?\na  $20000 b  $1430000 c $1450000 d $4020000", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn economics, total cost (TC) is composed of two components: fixed costs (FC) and variable costs (VC).

Variable costs are costs that change directly with the level of output.\n\nTo find the fixed costs, we look at the total costs when the output is zero. At zero output, there are no variable costs (VC = 0), so the total cost is equal to the fixed cost (TC = FC).\n\nAccording to the table, when the output is 0 (thousands), the total cost is 20 ($ thousands).

Public goods (like national defence and street lighting) and merit goods (like healthcare and education) are services that are essential for a society but are typically under-provided by the free market. Therefore, the government provides them, financing this provision through tax revenue. An increase in direct taxes on personal incomes and company profits directly increases the funds available to the government, making it the most likely reason for the government to be able to enhance or maintain the provision of these essential goods and services.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. to control spending on specific consumer goods**\nThis is incorrect. While higher income taxes reduce disposable income and can lower overall consumer spending, they are not an effective tool for targeting *specific* goods. To control spending on particular products (often demerit goods like tobacco or alcohol), governments typically use indirect taxes, such as excise duties. These taxes are applied directly to the goods, increasing their price and discouraging their consumption.\n\n**B. to encourage business investment**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in the tax on company profits reduces the amount of post-tax profit that a firm can retain. Retained profits are a major source of finance for business investment (e.g., buying new machinery or expanding facilities). Therefore, higher taxes on company profits are more likely to *discourage* business investment, not encourage it.\n\n**D. to reduce pollution from industrial production**\nThis is incorrect. The most direct and effective way for a government to reduce pollution is through specific environmental policies. These include environmental taxes (e.g., a carbon tax) levied on the polluting activity itself, or regulations that set limits on emissions. A general tax on company profits is an indirect and inefficient instrument for controlling pollution, as it does not specifically target the firms or activities that cause the most environmental damage."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_318.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "18 income tax in a country gives all individuals an initial tax-free income allowance. any income above\nthis allowance is taxed at increasing rates as the incomes of individuals rise.\nwhich change to this income tax will be regressive?\na decreasing the lowest rate of tax\nb_ decreasing the tax-free income allowance\nc increasing the tax-free income allowance\nd increasing the top rate of tax", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA regressive tax is one where the average tax rate (total tax paid as a percentage of total income) decreases as an individual's income increases. Essentially, it takes a larger proportion of income from lower-income earners than from higher-income earners. A change to a tax system is considered regressive if it causes this effect.\n\nDecreasing the tax-free income allowance means that a larger portion of every individual's income becomes subject to tax. For example, if the allowance is decreased by $1,000, everyone earning above the new allowance will pay tax on an additional $1,000 of their income. While the absolute increase in tax paid might be the same for a low-income and a high-income individual (if they fall into the same initial tax bracket), this additional tax amount represents a much larger percentage of the low-income person's total income. This disproportionately burdens lower-income individuals, making the change regressive.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A: decreasing the lowest rate of tax**\n    This change would make the tax system more progressive, not regressive. The lowest tax rate applies to the first portion of taxable income for all taxpayers. A reduction in this rate benefits all taxpayers, but the benefit is proportionally greater for lower-income individuals, as a larger part of their total taxable income falls into this lowest bracket. This reduces their average tax rate more significantly than it does for high-income earners.\n\n*   **C: increasing the tax-free income allowance**\n    This change would also make the tax system more progressive. Increasing the amount of income that is not taxed provides a tax reduction to all taxpayers. This fixed amount of tax saving (e.g., the tax that would have been paid on an extra $1,000 of income) constitutes a larger percentage of a low-income earner's total income compared to that of a high-income earner. Therefore, it benefits the poor proportionally more than the rich.\n\n*   **D: increasing the top rate of tax**\n    This change is explicitly progressive. The original system is already progressive, meaning higher incomes are taxed at higher rates. Increasing the top rate of tax only affects the highest earners, making them pay an even larger percentage of their income in tax.

This makes buying a house more affordable and is therefore an advantage, not a disadvantage, for house buyers.\n\n**B. manufacturers**\nManufacturers often borrow money to fund investment in new capital, such as machinery and factories. A lower interest rate reduces the cost of these loans, making investment cheaper and more attractive. This encourages firms to expand their operations, which is a significant advantage.\n\n**C. retailers**\nRetailers tend to benefit from lower interest rates for two main reasons. Firstly, lower rates encourage consumers to spend rather than save, which can lead to higher sales for retailers. Secondly, if retailers need to borrow money to finance their stock or expand their business, the cost of that borrowing is now lower, which is an advantage."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_320.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is a supply-side policy measure?\na _atariff on imported goods\nb_anincrease in indirect taxes\nc  acontractionary monetary policy\nd_ the removal of barriers to entry to a market", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nSupply-side policies are government actions intended to increase the productive capacity of the economy, thereby increasing aggregate supply. The removal of barriers to entry, a process often referred to as deregulation, is a classic example of a supply-side policy. By eliminating obstacles such as excessive licensing requirements or legal restrictions, the government makes it easier and cheaper for new firms to enter a market. This increases competition, which incentivises all firms to become more efficient, innovate, and lower their costs and prices. The overall effect is an increase in the economy's potential output.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** A tariff on imported goods is a measure of trade protectionism. It is a tax on imports designed to make them more expensive than domestically produced goods. While it may help domestic suppliers, it is not a supply-side policy in the conventional sense. In fact, by restricting foreign competition, it can reduce overall market efficiency and limit the total supply of goods available in an economy, which is contrary to the goals of supply-side policy.\n\n**B:** An increase in indirect taxes (such as VAT or sales tax) is a fiscal policy measure. It increases the costs of production for businesses. Firms will typically respond to higher costs by reducing the quantity they are willing to supply at any given price, which leads to a decrease in aggregate supply (a leftward shift of the SRAS curve). This is the opposite of the intended effect of a supply-side policy, which aims to increase aggregate supply.\n\n**C:** A contractionary monetary policy is a demand-side policy used by a central bank to reduce aggregate demand. This is typically achieved by raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses, thus reducing spending and investment. The purpose is to slow down economic growth and control inflation. This policy acts on aggregate demand, not the economy's productive capacity (aggregate supply)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_321.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 what is the most likely consequence of economic growth?\na more equal income distribution\nbmore use of resources\nc_ reduced imports\nd_ reduced tax revenue", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nEconomic growth is defined as an increase in the output of goods and services in an economy over time, typically measured by the percentage change in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To produce a greater quantity of goods and services, an economy must use more factors of production. This includes natural resources (like land, minerals, and energy), labour (more workers or longer hours), and capital (more machinery, factories, and infrastructure). Therefore, an increased use of resources is a direct and fundamental consequence of the process of economic growth.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. more equal income distribution:**\nEconomic growth does not automatically result in a more equal distribution of income. While a growing economy can create more jobs and opportunities, the benefits are not always shared evenly. In some cases, economic growth can lead to greater income inequality if the gains are disproportionately captured by owners of capital or high-skilled workers, while low-skilled workers' wages stagnate. Achieving a more equal distribution of income typically requires specific government intervention through policies such as progressive taxation and social welfare payments, which are not inherent outcomes of growth itself.\n\n**C. reduced imports:**\nEconomic growth is more likely to lead to an increase, not a reduction, in imports. As national income rises, consumers have higher purchasing power and tend to increase their spending on all goods and services, including those produced abroad. Furthermore, as domestic firms expand their production to fuel economic growth, they often need to import more raw materials, components, and capital goods (like machinery) from other countries. Therefore, a growing economy typically sees a rise in the demand for imports.\n\n**D. reduced tax revenue:**\nEconomic growth almost invariably leads to an increase in government tax revenue. As the economy grows, several things happen: more people are employed and earn higher incomes, leading to higher income tax collections; businesses make more profits, resulting in greater corporation tax revenue; and consumers spend more, which increases the revenue from indirect taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales taxes. A larger volume of economic activity expands the tax base, generating more revenue for the government even if tax rates remain unchanged."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_322.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "22 in high-income economies, cereal farming is highly productive but few workers are employed.\nwhat could have caused this employment situation?\na a fall in world demand for cereals\nbs alack of capital equipment\nc_ increased mechanisation of agriculture\nd large-scale migration from rural areas", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe combination of high productivity and low employment in cereal farming is a classic characteristic of a capital-intensive industry. Increased mechanisation means that capital equipment, such as combine harvesters, advanced tractors, and automated irrigation systems, is used to replace manual labour. This substitution of capital for labour has two main effects:\n\n1.  **High Productivity:** A single machine can perform the work of many workers far more quickly and efficiently, leading to a significant increase in output per worker (labour productivity).\n2.  **Low Employment:** As machines take over tasks previously done by people, the demand for agricultural workers falls, resulting in fewer people being employed in the sector.\n\nTherefore, increased mechanisation directly causes both high productivity and low employment, as described in the statement.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a fall in world demand for cereals:** A fall in world demand would likely lead to lower prices and reduced production. While this might cause farms to employ fewer workers, it does not explain why the farming that remains is \"highly productive.\" Lower demand does not inherently increase the efficiency of the production process.\n\n**B. a lack of capital equipment:** A lack of capital equipment would imply that farming is labour-intensive, relying heavily on manual workers rather than machinery. This would result in low productivity (low output per worker) and high employment, which is the exact opposite of the situation described.\n\n**D. large-scale migration from rural areas:** Large-scale migration from rural areas is often an *effect* rather than a *cause* of the situation described. When mechanisation reduces the number of available farm jobs, workers migrate to urban areas in search of other employment. While this contributes to the low number of workers in rural areas, it is the mechanisation itself that causes the high productivity and the initial reduction in demand for labour."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_323.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 who is most likely to benefit during a period of inflation?\na creditors (lenders)\nb_ debtors (borrowers)\nc fixed income earners\nd holders of cash", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nDuring a period of inflation, the general price level of goods and services rises, which means the real value (or purchasing power) of money decreases. Debtors (borrowers) benefit from this situation. They borrow money at a certain value but repay the loan later with money that is worth less. For instance, if a person borrows \u00a31,000 and the inflation rate is 5% over the next year, the \u00a31,000 they repay will have the purchasing power of only \u00a3950 from the previous year. The real value of their debt has fallen, making it easier to pay back, especially if their wages have also risen with inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: creditors (lenders)**\nCreditors are harmed by inflation. They lend money at a certain value but are repaid later with money that has less purchasing power. Unless the interest rate on the loan is higher than the rate of inflation (which is not always the case, especially with unexpected inflation), the real return on their loan will be negative or lower than anticipated. The value of the asset they hold (the loan) erodes over time.\n\n**C: fixed income earners**\nIndividuals on a fixed income, such as pensioners or workers with multi-year contracts that do not adjust for inflation, are negatively affected. Their nominal income remains the same, but as prices for goods and services rise, the purchasing power of their income falls. This leads to a decline in their real income and standard of living, as they can afford to buy less with the same amount of money.\n\n**D: holders of cash**\nHolding cash (or savings in a non-interest-bearing account) during a period of inflation results in a loss of value. As the general price level increases, the purchasing power of the cash held decreases. For every percentage point of inflation, the real value of the cash savings falls by that same amount.

Productivity is the measure of output per unit of input (e.g., output per worker). When productivity rises, firms can produce more goods and services with the same amount of resources. This increase in efficiency leads to higher overall economic output (real GDP). As the economy grows, this can translate into higher wages for workers and increased profits for firms. Consequently, individuals have higher disposable incomes, allowing them to purchase more goods and services, which is a key component of material living standards. Additionally, higher national income allows for greater government tax revenue, which can be used to improve public services like healthcare and education, further enhancing overall living standards.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** An increase in a government budget surplus is unlikely to cause an increase in consumer saving. A budget surplus occurs when government revenue exceeds its spending. This is often achieved by increasing taxes or reducing government expenditure. Higher taxes on income or consumption reduce households' disposable income, making it more difficult for them to save. Similarly, reduced government spending, such as cuts to public sector wages or welfare benefits, can also lower household incomes. Both scenarios would likely lead to a decrease, not an increase, in overall consumer saving.\n\n**B:** An increase in consumer spending is likely to lead to a decrease, not an increase, in unemployment. Consumer spending is a major component of a country's aggregate demand. When consumers spend more, the demand for goods and services rises. In response, firms increase their production levels to meet this higher demand. To increase production, firms typically need to hire more workers, which reduces the level of unemployment in the economy.\n\n**C:** An increase in inflation is likely to lead to a decrease, not an increase, in a trade surplus. Inflation is a sustained rise in the general price level. If a country's inflation rate is higher than that of its trading partners, its exports become relatively more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to a fall in export demand. At the same time, imported goods become relatively cheaper for domestic consumers, leading to a rise in import demand. The combination of falling exports and rising imports will worsen the country's trade balance, causing a trade surplus to shrink or a trade deficit to grow."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_325.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 which combination would be most likely to increase the population of a country?\n| | birth rates death rates\na high high positive\nb high low positive\ncc low high negative\nd low low negative", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA country's population increases when the number of people being added to the population is greater than the number of people being removed. Population change is determined by two main components: natural change (births minus deaths) and net migration (immigration minus emigration).\n\nTo achieve the largest possible increase, a country would need a high birth rate, a low death rate, and positive net immigration.\n\n*   **High birth rate:** This means a large number of new individuals are being born and added to the population.\n*   **Low death rate:** This means a small number of individuals are dying and being removed from the population. The combination of a high birth rate and a low death rate results in a high rate of natural increase.\n*   **Positive net immigration:** This indicates that more people are moving into the country (immigrants) than are moving out (emigrants), resulting in a net gain in population from migration.\n\nCombination B includes all three of these factors, making it the scenario that would most likely lead to a significant increase in a country's population.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This combination includes a high birth rate and positive net immigration, both of which contribute to population growth. However, it also features a high death rate, which counteracts the effect of the high birth rate. The overall impact on population would depend on whether the birth rate is higher than the death rate. While the population might increase, the growth would be less certain and likely smaller than in a scenario with a low death rate (Option B).\n\n**C:** This combination would most likely lead to a significant *decrease* in population. A low birth rate and a high death rate result in a natural decrease (more deaths than births). Furthermore, negative net immigration (also known as net emigration) means more people are leaving the country than arriving. With all three factors contributing to a population decline, this is the opposite of the required outcome.\n\n**D:** This combination is unlikely to lead to a population increase. While a low death rate helps to retain population, it is coupled with a low birth rate and negative net immigration. A low birth rate reduces the number of new people, and negative net immigration signifies a net loss of people to other countries.

In most economies, individuals in this age group have retired from the labour force. Governments provide financial support to retirees in the form of state pensions. These pensions are a type of **transfer payment**, which is a payment made by the government to an individual for which no good or service is exchanged. As the number of people eligible for state pensions and other age-related benefits (such as healthcare subsidies) increases, total government expenditure on these transfer payments will necessarily rise.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. More facilities will be needed to retrain workers.**\nRetraining facilities are primarily for individuals within the active labour force who need to update their skills due to technological changes or shifts in industrial structure. While some people may choose to work beyond the age of 65 and could require retraining, an increasing proportion of the population over 65 primarily leads to a larger number of retirees who are no longer part of the workforce. Therefore, a large-scale increase in the need for retraining facilities is not the most direct or significant consequence of an ageing population.\n\n**C. The total savings in the economy will increase.**\nThis is unlikely. According to the life-cycle theory of consumption and saving, individuals tend to save during their working years to fund their retirement. Once they retire, they begin to 'dis-save', meaning they spend their accumulated savings to maintain their standard of living. An increasing proportion of the population over 65 means that more people will be in the dis-saving phase of their lives. This will likely lead to a decrease, not an increase, in the overall level of savings in the economy.\n\n**D. There will be a rise in the economic growth rate.**\nAn ageing population is more likely to lead to a slowdown in the economic growth rate. Economic growth is often linked to the size and productivity of the labour force. As the proportion of the population over 65 increases, the dependency ratio (the ratio of non-workers to workers) rises, and the size of the labour force may shrink. A smaller workforce can limit the economy's productive capacity, potentially leading to lower rates of economic growth.

The ability to produce products more cheaply than other nations gives a country an absolute advantage. This cost advantage is the primary incentive for specialisation. By focusing on producing goods where it is most efficient, a country can maximise its output and income. It can then export these goods and use the revenue to import products that other countries can produce more cheaply. This process leads to a more efficient allocation of global resources and higher overall consumption for all participating countries.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: similarities in climate in different countries**\nSimilarities in climate would likely lead to countries having similar capabilities in producing agricultural and other climate-dependent goods. This would reduce the basis for specialisation and trade between them, as each country could produce these goods for itself with similar efficiency. International specialisation is encouraged by *differences* in factors of production, such as climate, which give certain countries a natural advantage in producing specific goods (e.g., tropical fruits in tropical climates, wheat in temperate climates).\n\n**C: the discovery of oil in a country that had no oil before**\nWhile the discovery of oil would almost certainly lead that specific country to specialise in oil production and export, this is an example of a cause, not the fundamental underlying principle. The discovery gives the country the ability to produce oil more cheaply than many others, which is the situation described in option B. Option B is a more general and fundamental statement that explains why any form of specialisation occurs, not just in response to a single event like a resource discovery. Therefore, the ability to produce more cheaply is the more comprehensive reason for specialisation.\n\n**D: very high international transport costs**\nHigh transport costs act as a significant barrier to international trade and specialisation. If the cost of shipping a product from one country to another is very high, it can negate any cost savings from producing that product more cheaply abroad. This makes importing less attractive and encourages countries to produce goods domestically, even if it is less efficient. Therefore, high transport costs discourage international specialisation, while low transport costs encourage it."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_328.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 country x established free trade agreements with other nations.\nwhat would be the intended benefit of such agreements to country x?\na increased labour shortages\nb increased tariff revenue\nc_ more efficient allocation of resources\nd protection from low wage competition", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA core objective of establishing free trade agreements is to achieve a more efficient allocation of a country's resources. Free trade encourages countries to specialise in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage\u2014that is, what they can produce at a lower opportunity cost than other nations. By removing trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas, a country can import goods more cheaply than it could produce them domestically. This allows the country to shift its resources (land, labour, and capital) away from inefficient industries and towards more productive, export-oriented industries. This specialisation and trade lead to higher overall output, increased economic welfare, and a more efficient use of scarce resources.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: increased labour shortages**\nIncreased labour shortages are not an intended benefit of free trade agreements. While the expansion of successful export industries may increase demand for labour in certain sectors, the contraction of less efficient industries competing with imports would release labour. The net effect on the overall labour market is complex, but creating shortages is not a goal. In fact, some free trade agreements include provisions for the freer movement of labour, which would help to alleviate, not create, labour shortages.\n\n**B: increased tariff revenue**\nThis is incorrect. A free trade agreement involves the reduction or complete elimination of tariffs (taxes on imports) between member countries. As a result, the government's revenue from tariffs on goods traded within the free trade area will decrease, not increase. While total trade volume might rise, the lower (or zero) tariff rates mean that overall tariff revenue from partner countries will fall.\n\n**D: protection from low wage competition**\nThis is the opposite of the effect of a free trade agreement. Such agreements reduce or eliminate protectionist measures like tariffs. This increases a country's exposure to international competition, including from countries that may have lower labour costs. The underlying principle of free trade is that the benefits of specialisation and efficiency outweigh the costs to specific domestic industries that face this increased competition. Protectionism is a policy designed to shield domestic industries from foreign competition, whereas free trade aims to embrace it."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_329.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "29 acountry\u2019s foreign exchange rate appreciates significantly.\nwhich group in the country will directly benefit from this change?\na agovernment department which only buys locally made goods\nb retailers who get all their supplies from foreign producers\nc_ workers in local companies that compete with foreign firms in the local market\nd_ workers in local companies that sell only in foreign countries", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAn appreciation of a country's foreign exchange rate means that the domestic currency has increased in value relative to foreign currencies. Consequently, one unit of the domestic currency can now purchase more units of a foreign currency. This makes imported goods and services cheaper in terms of the domestic currency. Retailers who source all their supplies from foreign producers are importers. A stronger domestic currency directly lowers their cost of acquiring these supplies. This reduction in costs can lead to higher profit margins or allow them to lower their prices to gain a competitive advantage, thus directly benefiting them.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** A government department that only buys locally made goods operates entirely within the domestic economy. Its transactions are conducted in the local currency, and the prices it pays are not directly influenced by fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. Therefore, an appreciation of the currency will have no direct financial benefit or cost for this department.\n\n**C:** An appreciation of the domestic currency makes imported goods cheaper for consumers.

Therefore, this group is likely to be harmed, not benefited.\n\n**D:** An appreciation of the domestic currency makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers. A local company that sells only in foreign countries is an exporter. As its goods become more expensive abroad, the quantity demanded by foreign consumers is likely to fall.

This concept is central to economics and arises from the problem of scarcity\u2014the fact that resources are finite while human wants are infinite.\n\nFood is an economic good, meaning it is scarce relative to the demand for it. The production of food requires the use of limited resources such as land, labour, and capital. Because these resources are scarce, they have alternative uses. For example, the land used to grow crops could have been used for housing, and the labour used for farming could have been employed in a factory.\n\nFrom a consumer's perspective, obtaining food typically requires an expenditure of money or effort. The money spent on food cannot be used to purchase other goods or services, such as clothing or entertainment. The value of these forgone items represents the opportunity cost of consuming the food. Therefore, because food is a scarce resource that requires a choice and a sacrifice of alternatives, it has an opportunity cost in consumption.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. air**\n\nAir is considered a free good. A free good is one that is not scarce and is available in sufficient quantity to satisfy all wants at zero price. Consequently, consuming a free good does not involve an opportunity cost. One does not have to give up anything to breathe the air that is naturally available. While clean air can become a scarce resource in polluted areas, leading to costs for purification, air in its general sense is abundant and does not require a sacrifice of other alternatives for its consumption.\n\n**C. sea water**\n\nIn its natural state, sea water is a free good. It is abundant in the oceans, and its consumption (for example, for swimming or by marine life) does not typically require forgoing any other good or service. There is no scarcity associated with taking water from the sea. Therefore, it has no opportunity cost. It is important to distinguish this from desalinated or purified water, which is an economic good because its production requires scarce resources and thus involves an opportunity cost.\n\n**D. sunlight**\n\nSunlight is a classic example of a free good. It is naturally and abundantly available, and its supply is not limited in a way that creates scarcity for consumers. One person's enjoyment of sunlight does not reduce the amount available for others, and no resources have to be sacrificed to consume it.

A manager of a private sector firm makes decisions that are central to microeconomic analysis. These decisions include setting the price of the firm's products, determining the quantity of output to produce, deciding how many workers to hire, and managing production costs. These choices are all made at the level of the individual firm to maximise profit or achieve other business objectives, which is the core focus of microeconomics.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a government finance minister:** A government finance minister is primarily concerned with macroeconomics, which deals with the economy as a whole.

In a market economy, this is achieved through the interaction of demand and supply, a process often referred to as the 'price mechanism'. Consumers express their wants through demand, and producers respond by supplying goods and services. The resulting market prices act as signals; they guide producers on what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it, thereby allocating resources like land, labour, and capital to their most valued uses without central planning.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. all resources used to produce consumer goods**\nThis statement is incorrect because economies produce more than just consumer goods. Resources are also allocated to the production of capital goods (e.g., machinery, factories) which are used to produce other goods and services, and in most economies, to the provision of public and merit goods by the government. The allocation of resources between consumer and capital goods is a key economic decision, but it is not a defining feature of the market system that *all* resources go to consumer goods.\n\n**B. an economy with both a private and a public sector**\nAn economy that features both a private sector (where resources are owned and controlled by private individuals and firms) and a public sector (where resources are controlled by the state) is defined as a mixed economy.

The price elasticity of supply is almost always a positive number because of the law of supply, which states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied also increases. This creates a positive relationship. A negative PES would imply that suppliers provide less of a good when its price rises, which contradicts the fundamental principle of supply.\n\n**B: +0.5**\nThis value is incorrect.

Public goods are a key example of this. A public good is defined by two main characteristics: it is **non-excludable** (it is not possible to prevent someone from using the good) and **non-rivalrous** (one person's use of the good does not diminish another's ability to use it).\n\nBecause of the non-excludable nature of public goods like national defence, street lighting, or law enforcement, private firms are unable to charge consumers for their use. This creates the \"free-rider problem,\" where individuals can benefit from the good without paying for it. Since private firms are profit-driven and cannot ensure payment, they have no financial incentive to produce these goods. Consequently, the government steps in to provide them, funding their provision through compulsory taxation to ensure that these socially desirable services are available to all.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The government always provides goods more cheaply than private firms.**\nThis statement is incorrect. There is no guarantee that government provision is more cost-effective than private provision. Private firms, driven by the profit motive and competition, often have strong incentives to minimize costs and operate efficiently. In contrast, state-run organisations can sometimes be less efficient due to factors like bureaucracy, lack of competition, or political priorities that may conflict with cost minimisation. While the price to the consumer might be lower (or zero), the actual cost of production for the government may be higher than it would be for a private firm.\n\n**B. The government considers only private costs and private benefits.**\nThis statement is the opposite of the government's role in a mixed economy. It is private firms that typically focus on their own private costs (e.g., wages, materials) and private benefits (e.g., revenue). The government's economic role is to consider the wider **social costs** and **social benefits**. Social costs include private costs plus any negative externalities (e.g., pollution), while social benefits include private benefits plus any positive externalities (e.g., a more educated workforce from public education). Government intervention is often justified precisely because it accounts for these wider societal impacts that the private sector ignores.\n\n**C. The government provides goods to prevent the development of monopolies.**\nWhile governments do regulate markets to prevent or control monopolies, this is not the primary reason they provide goods and services themselves. The main tools for dealing with monopolies are competition laws, price regulations, and preventing anti-competitive mergers. The decision for the government to directly provide a good is typically based on the nature of the good itself, such as in the case of public goods (which private firms will not supply) or some natural monopolies where state ownership is chosen over private regulation. However, the fundamental reason for providing goods like streetlights or national defence is not about preventing a monopoly, but because the market fails to provide them in the first place."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_339.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "9 agovernment intends to subsidise bus fares and increase taxes on private motoring.\nhow would this affect the private cost of transport?\n\u2018 for bus\nfor motorists\npassengers\na decrease decrease\nb decrease increase\ncc increase decrease\nd increase increase", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn increase in taxes on private motoring, such as higher fuel duties or road taxes, directly raises the expenses associated with owning and operating a car.

The functions of money describe the specific roles it plays in an economy. Characteristics, such as portability (being easy to carry), durability (lasting a long time), divisibility (being able to be divided into smaller units), and acceptability, are the physical properties that enable an item to serve effectively as money. While money must be portable to be a convenient medium of exchange, its portability is a feature, not its purpose or function.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: medium of exchange**\nThis is one of the three primary functions of money. As a medium of exchange, money acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions, eliminating the need for a \"double coincidence of wants\" that is necessary for barter. In a barter system, two parties must each have a good or service that the other wants. Money solves this problem by being universally accepted in exchange for all goods and services.\n\n**C: store of value**\nThis is another core function of money. Money serves as a store of value because it can be held over time and used for future purchases. It allows individuals to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future.

This is known as a binding price floor. In this case, the equilibrium wage is $15,000. A minimum wage of $18,000 is binding and will increase the cost of hiring bus drivers. According to the law of demand, as the price of labor (the wage) increases, the quantity of labor demanded by bus companies will decrease, leading to unemployment.\n\nThe demand for bus drivers is a derived demand; it depends on the demand for the final service, which is bus travel. If the demand for bus travel remains unchanged, the demand curve for bus drivers will not shift. Therefore, the full impact of the wage increase will be felt, leading to the maximum possible reduction in the quantity of drivers demanded among the given scenarios. This combination of a high binding wage and static demand for the final service creates the largest surplus of labor (unemployment).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** A national minimum wage of $15,000 will have no effect on employment. This is because the minimum wage is set at the same level as the current market equilibrium wage. As it does not raise the cost of labor for employers, there is no incentive for them to reduce the number of drivers they employ. This is a non-binding price floor.\n\n**B:** A national minimum wage of $15,000 is a non-binding price floor because it is equal to the current equilibrium wage. It does not increase the cost of labor for bus companies. Consequently, it will not cause any bus drivers to become unemployed, regardless of whether the demand for bus travel is unchanged or not.\n\n**C:** While a minimum wage of $18,000 is a binding price floor and will cause some unemployment, the effect is mitigated by the increasing demand for bus travel. An increase in the demand for bus travel will increase the derived demand for bus drivers, shifting the labor demand curve to the right. This means that at the new, higher wage of $18,000, bus companies will want to hire more drivers than they would have if the demand for bus travel had remained unchanged.

Vertical growth involves expanding into a different stage of production within the same industry.

This is the opposite of diseconomies of scale. Internal economies of scale occur when a firm's long-run average costs fall as it increases its own output, often due to factors like bulk-buying discounts, specialisation of labour, and technical efficiencies.\n\n**B: average cost for the firm decreases when the output of the industry increases**\nThis statement describes **external economies of scale**. The term \"external\" indicates that the cost advantage comes from factors outside the individual firm, specifically the growth of the entire industry.

This occurs when the growth of an entire industry causes the average costs for all firms within that industry to rise.

Labour costs, such as the wages of production workers, are a primary component of variable costs, as they change with the level of output. Conversely, the costs associated with purchasing, installing, and maintaining machinery are typically fixed costs, which do not vary with output.\n\nBy replacing labour with capital, the firm reduces its expenditure on wages, thus lowering its total variable costs. Simultaneously, it increases its expenditure on machinery, raising its total fixed costs. This change in the cost structure means that variable costs will constitute a smaller proportion of the firm's total costs. Therefore, variable costs as a percentage of total cost are likely to decrease.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A: fixed costs as a percentage of total cost**\nThis is incorrect because the shift to capital-intensive production involves significant investment in machinery and equipment. These are fixed costs. As the firm substitutes capital for labour, fixed costs will rise while variable costs fall. Consequently, fixed costs will represent a larger, not smaller, percentage of the firm's total cost.\n\n**B: output per worker per hour**\nThis is incorrect. \"Output per worker per hour\" is a measure of labour productivity. A key reason for adopting capital-intensive methods is to increase efficiency. The remaining workers will be equipped with more advanced machinery, which allows each of them to produce a greater quantity of goods in the same amount of time. Therefore, labour productivity is likely to increase, not decrease.\n\n**C: the level of total output**\nThis is incorrect. Firms typically invest in capital-intensive production to expand their production capacity and take advantage of economies of scale.

Insurance premiums are a classic example of a fixed cost. A business typically pays a set amount for insurance coverage (e.g., for its factory or equipment) on a regular schedule, such as monthly or annually. This cost remains constant whether the firm produces 10 units or 10,000 units, or even if it temporarily halts production altogether.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. electricity**\nElectricity is a variable cost. A variable cost is an expense that changes in direct proportion to the level of production. The amount of electricity a firm consumes is directly linked to its operational activity. For instance, running machinery, lighting a production facility, and powering computers all consume electricity. As a firm increases its output, it will typically use more electricity, leading to a higher bill. Conversely, if production decreases, electricity costs will fall.\n\n**C. raw materials**\nThe cost of raw materials is a prime example of a variable cost. Raw materials are the inputs directly used to create a product. The total amount spent on raw materials is directly proportional to the quantity of goods produced. For example, a furniture maker must buy more wood to build more tables. If production doubles, the cost of wood will also double. If production stops, no raw materials are consumed, and this cost becomes zero.\n\n**D. wages**\nWages are generally considered a variable cost, particularly when they are paid to production workers based on the hours worked or the number of units produced (piece-rate). In this case, the total wage bill increases as output rises because more labour is required.

A firm is said to be maximising its profit when it produces at an output level where it cannot increase profit further by either increasing or decreasing its output. In economic theory, this occurs at the level of output where marginal cost (the cost of producing one additional unit) equals marginal revenue (the revenue gained from selling one additional unit).

The scenario describes the central bank's action of using interest rates to limit the rise in the price level to a specific target (3%). This is a direct implementation of inflation-targeting monetary policy. By raising interest rates, a central bank makes borrowing more expensive for consumers and firms, which tends to reduce spending and investment. This decrease in aggregate demand helps to alleviate upward pressure on prices, thereby controlling inflation. The stated goal of keeping the price level rise to 3% is, by definition, an objective of low inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A - balance of payments equilibrium:**\nWhile monetary policy, such as changing the interest rate, does affect the balance of payments, it is not the direct aim described. A balance of payments equilibrium occurs when a country's total payments to other countries are equal to its total receipts from them. Raising interest rates can attract foreign financial investment (hot money), which would improve the financial account of the balance of payments. However, the explicit goal mentioned is controlling the domestic price level, not managing international financial flows.\n\n**B - economic growth:**\nEconomic growth is the increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy over time, typically measured by real GDP. The policy of raising interest rates to control inflation is generally contractionary, meaning it is designed to slow down economic activity. Higher borrowing costs discourage investment and consumption, which can lead to slower, not faster, economic growth in the short term. Therefore, the action taken is contrary to the direct pursuit of economic growth.\n\n**C - full employment:**\nFull employment is a situation where all who are able and willing to work at the going wage rate are employed. Raising interest rates to curb inflation can lead to a short-term increase in unemployment. As higher interest rates reduce aggregate demand, firms may cut back on production and lay off workers. This illustrates the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment (often depicted by the Phillips Curve). The policy is aimed at price stability, not directly at achieving full employment."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_348.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "18 the table shows a forecast for a government budget for year 1 and for year 2.\n\n| year 1 $bn year 2 $bn\nrevenue 50 55\nspending 60 60\n\nwhat does the forecast government budget for year 2 show?\n\na_ the budget deficit decreased when compared with year 1.\n\nb_ the budget deficit increased when compared with year 1.\n\nc_ the budget surplus decreased when compared with year 1.\n\nd_ the budget surplus increased when compared with year 1.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nA government's budget position is determined by comparing its revenue and spending.

In both year 1 and year 2, government spending was greater than its revenue. Therefore, the government ran a budget deficit in both years, not a surplus. As there was no budget surplus in either period, it is impossible for a surplus to have decreased.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis statement is incorrect because a budget surplus did not exist in either year.

The impact of the tax will fall entirely upon the consumer.**\n\nThis conclusion is correct due to the nature of the demand curve shown in the graph. The demand curve (D) is a vertical line, which represents **perfectly inelastic demand**. This means that the quantity demanded by consumers does not change, regardless of any change in price.\n\nWhen the government imposes a tax on producers, it increases their cost of production. This is illustrated by the upward shift of the supply curve from S1 to S2. The vertical distance between S1 and S2 represents the value of the tax per unit.\n\nBecause demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers are willing to purchase the same quantity of petrol even at a higher price. Consequently, producers are able to pass the entire cost of the tax on to consumers by increasing the price by the full amount of the tax. The new equilibrium price paid by consumers is therefore higher than the original price by the exact amount of the tax. The price received by producers (after paying the tax) remains the same as the original equilibrium price. Thus, the consumer bears the entire economic burden (incidence) of the tax.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The government will receive no tax revenue.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Government tax revenue is calculated by multiplying the tax per unit by the quantity of the good sold. The graph shows that even after the tax is imposed (at the new equilibrium where S2 intersects D), a positive quantity of petrol is being bought and sold. Since there is a tax on each unit sold and a non-zero quantity is transacted, the government will collect tax revenue.\n\n**B. The impact of the tax will be shared between the consumer and the producer.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The burden of a tax is shared between consumers and producers when both the demand and supply curves have some degree of price elasticity (i.e., they are sloped). In this specific case, the demand is perfectly inelastic (vertical). In such an extreme scenario, the burden is not shared. The group with the lower price elasticity of demand (or supply) bears a larger portion of the tax burden. As consumers have zero price elasticity of demand, they bear 100% of the burden.\n\n**D. The impact of the tax will fall entirely on the producer.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The burden of a tax would fall entirely on the producer under two specific conditions: either if demand were perfectly elastic (a horizontal demand curve) or if supply were perfectly inelastic (a vertical supply curve). The graph clearly shows a perfectly inelastic demand curve and an upward-sloping (elastic) supply curve. Therefore, the burden falls entirely on the consumer, not the producer."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_350.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "20 what is most likely to result from a successful supply-side policy?\na adeterioration in the current account of the balance of payments\nb- economic growth\nc increased inflation\nd_ increased structural unemployment", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA successful supply-side policy aims to increase the productive capacity of an economy. It achieves this by improving the quantity or quality of the factors of production and by making markets work more efficiently. Policies such as deregulation, privatisation, and investment in education and infrastructure enhance the ability of firms to supply more goods and services at every price level. This increase in the economy's potential output is represented by a rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, which constitutes long-run economic growth. Therefore, economic growth is the most direct and intended outcome of a successful supply-side policy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments**\n\nThis is incorrect. A successful supply-side policy generally leads to an *improvement* in the current account of the balance of payments. By increasing efficiency and productivity, domestic firms become more competitive in international markets. This makes their exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers, increasing export revenue. At the same time, domestically produced goods become more competitive against imports, potentially reducing import expenditure. Both factors would improve the current account position (i.e., increase a surplus or reduce a deficit), not cause it to deteriorate.\n\n**C: increased inflation**\n\nThis is the opposite of what is likely to happen. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level. A successful supply-side policy increases the economy's aggregate supply. An increase in the supply of goods and services, assuming aggregate demand remains constant, puts downward pressure on prices. This helps to control or reduce inflation. In contrast, it is an increase in aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply that typically causes demand-pull inflation. Supply-side policies work to combat inflation by expanding the economy's output.\n\n**D: increased structural unemployment**\n\nThis is unlikely to be the result of a *successful* supply-side policy. While certain supply-side reforms, such as the privatisation or deregulation of inefficient industries, might cause short-term structural unemployment, a key goal of comprehensive supply-side policy is to *reduce* it in the long run. Policies such as government-funded training schemes and educational reforms are specifically designed to improve the skills of the workforce, making workers more adaptable to changing economic structures and reducing the mismatch between their skills and the jobs available. A successful policy would therefore lead to a more flexible labour market and lower, not higher, structural unemployment over time."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_351.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "21 the table shows the rates of unemployment and real gdp growth for an economy in year 1 and\nyear 2.\nveer pier |\nrate of 3 7\nunemployment (%)\nrate of real gdp 3 -1\ngrowth (%)\nwhich combination of policy measures would be most effective in returning the economy to the\nyear 1 level of activity?\na adecrease in direct taxes and an increase in the rate of interest\nb_ adecrease in government expenditure and an increase in the rate of interest\nc_anincrease in direct taxes and a decrease in the rate of interest\ndan increase in government expenditure and a decrease in the rate of interest", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn analysis of the data shows that the economy has moved from a state of healthy growth in Year 1 (3% real GDP growth, 3% unemployment) to a recession in Year 2 (-1% real GDP growth, 7% unemployment). To return the economy to the Year 1 level of activity, the government and central bank need to implement expansionary policies to stimulate aggregate demand, which in turn boosts economic growth and reduces unemployment.\n\nOption D combines two powerful expansionary policies. An increase in government expenditure is a form of expansionary fiscal policy. It directly increases a component of aggregate demand (G), leading to a multiplied increase in national income, output, and employment. A decrease in the rate of interest is an expansionary monetary policy. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for both consumers and firms, encouraging consumption and investment, which are also key components of aggregate demand. Using both policies in tandem creates the strongest stimulus to lift the economy out of recession.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: a decrease in direct taxes and an increase in the rate of interest**\nThis option combines expansionary fiscal policy (a decrease in direct taxes, which increases disposable income and consumption) with contractionary monetary policy (an increase in the rate of interest, which discourages borrowing for consumption and investment). These policies have conflicting effects on aggregate demand and would likely work against each other, making them less effective than a coordinated expansionary approach.\n\n**B: a decrease in government expenditure and an increase in the rate of interest**\nThis option combines two contractionary policies. A decrease in government expenditure (contractionary fiscal policy) and an increase in the rate of interest (contractionary monetary policy) would both reduce aggregate demand. This would worsen the recession, leading to even lower real GDP growth and higher unemployment, which is the opposite of the stated goal.\n\n**C: an increase in direct taxes and a decrease in the rate of interest**\nThis option combines contractionary fiscal policy (an increase in direct taxes, which reduces disposable income and consumption) with expansionary monetary policy (a decrease in the rate of interest). As with option A, these policies have conflicting objectives.

The data indicates such a shift. Between year 1 and year 2, employment in manufacturing fell by 2 million (from 4 million to 2 million), while employment in the services sector grew by 3 million (from 13 million to 16 million). This decline of a traditional sector (manufacturing) and the rise of another (services) is a classic cause of structural unemployment. The workers laid off from manufacturing may not have the appropriate skills for the new jobs in the service industry. This is further supported by the rise in long-term unemployment from 1 million to 2 million, which is characteristic of structural unemployment as it takes time for workers to retrain or relocate.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Cyclical:**\nCyclical unemployment is associated with the downturns of the business cycle (recessions). It increases when overall economic activity slows down and decreases during economic expansion. The table shows that total employment increased from 25 million to 28 million, and total unemployment decreased (from 5 million to 2 million). This suggests the economy is in a period of growth, not a recession. Therefore, cyclical unemployment would likely be falling, not be the most prominent type of unemployment.\n\n**B) Frictional:**\nFrictional unemployment is the short-term unemployment experienced by individuals who are in the process of moving between jobs. It is a natural part of a dynamic labour market. However, the data shows that the number of long-term unemployed workers doubled from 1 million to 2 million. In year 2, the total number of unemployed people is 2 million, all of whom are long-term unemployed. This contradicts the short-term nature of frictional unemployment.\n\n**C) Seasonal:**\nSeasonal unemployment occurs when the demand for labour changes according to the season, such as in agriculture or tourism.

The lowest 20% of households in the US receive 5.1% of the US GDP, while the lowest 20% in Mexico receive 5.4% of Mexico's GDP. To compare their actual incomes, the total GDP of each country must be considered. As the US has a significantly larger total GDP than Mexico, 5.1% of the US GDP is a much larger absolute amount than 5.4% of Mexico's GDP.

This policy promotes social mobility and a more equitable distribution of income over time.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A. a contractionary fiscal policy**\nA contractionary fiscal policy involves decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes. This is designed to reduce aggregate demand and slow down the economy. Such a policy is likely to increase poverty, not decrease it. Reductions in government spending often lead to cuts in welfare benefits, subsidies, and public services that low-income households rely on. Higher taxes can reduce the disposable income of the poor.

A decrease in the national minimum wage would allow employers to pay these workers less.

Consequently, this would lead to an increase, not a decrease, in relative poverty.\n\n**D. an increase in barriers to entry for multinational companies**\nBarriers to entry, such as tariffs or restrictive regulations, discourage multinational companies (MNCs) from investing in a country. MNCs often bring significant capital investment, create jobs, and introduce new technologies.

The 'working-age population' constitutes the pool of individuals in an economy who are potentially available for work. Therefore, a large increase in the working-age population directly and significantly increases the quantity of the labour factor of production. This demographic shift is a primary driver of potential economic growth as it expands the productive capacity of a nation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: enterprise**\nEnterprise is the factor of production that involves organising land, labour, and capital, and taking the financial risks associated with a business venture. While a larger population might lead to a higher absolute number of entrepreneurs, an increase in the working-age population primarily expands the general workforce. It does not automatically guarantee a proportional or significant rise in the specialised skills of innovation, management, and risk-taking that define enterprise.\n\n**C: capital**\nCapital consists of man-made goods, such as machinery, equipment, and factories, that are used to produce other goods and services.

This lowers the average cost of production. In a competitive market, these cost savings are often passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices for goods and services.\n*   **Better Quality:** When workers and firms focus on producing a specific product, they develop greater expertise, skills, and advanced production techniques.

When an MNC enters a host country's market, it can produce goods and services more efficiently and at a lower cost than local firms. This heightened competition can put immense pressure on domestic industries. Local firms may struggle to compete, leading to reduced market share, lower profits, and in some cases, business failure and job losses in the domestic sector. Therefore, while competition can benefit consumers through lower prices, it represents a significant cost to the survival and growth of local businesses.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. increased access to modern technology**\n\nThis is a benefit, not a cost, to the host country. MNCs typically bring with them advanced production techniques, machinery, and management practices. This can lead to technology transfer, where local workers and firms learn and adopt these modern methods. This spillover effect can increase the overall productivity and efficiency of the host country's economy, making it an advantage of foreign direct investment.\n\n**C. increased employment for workers**\n\nThe establishment of a new factory directly creates jobs for the local population, which is a significant benefit to the host country. This leads to a reduction in unemployment, an increase in household incomes, and a potential rise in the standard of living. This effect stimulates economic activity and is one of the primary reasons host governments encourage investment from MNCs.\n\n**D. increased tax revenue for the government**\n\nThis is a benefit, not a cost. The MNC will be required to pay corporation tax on the profits it generates within the host country. Furthermore, the workers employed by the new factory will pay income tax on their wages. This combined increase in tax receipts provides the government with more revenue to fund public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, thereby benefiting the entire country."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_359.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "29 the diagram shows the change in the exchange rate market for country x\u2019s $.\nss\nexchange\nrate\nd\nbb, \u201c2\no\nquantity of $\nwhich change in country x would have caused this?\na afall in its international competitiveness\nb a fall in its level of interest rates\nc arise in its exports of services\nd arise in its imports of goods", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA rise in the exports of services from country X means that foreigners are purchasing more of its services (such as tourism, banking, or insurance).

This forces every society to make choices about how to allocate its scarce resources. These choices are traditionally summarised by three fundamental economic questions. The question \"When will we produce?\" is not considered one of these fundamental questions. While the timing of production is a relevant business and logistical decision, it is secondary to the core allocative questions forced by scarcity itself. The fundamental questions address the allocation of resources, not the schedule of their use.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. For whom will we produce?**\nThis is one of the three fundamental economic questions arising from scarcity. Because the quantity of goods and services produced is limited, a society must have a way to decide how this output is distributed among its population. This question addresses the issue of allocation and income distribution \u2013 who gets to consume the products that have been made with scarce resources.\n\n**B. How will we produce?**\nThis is one of the three fundamental economic questions arising from scarcity. Since resources like labour, capital, and land are limited, societies must decide on the methods of production. This involves choosing the most efficient combination of resources to produce goods and services, for example, deciding between labour-intensive or capital-intensive production techniques.\n\n**C. What will we produce?**\nThis is one of the three fundamental economic questions arising from scarcity. As it is impossible to produce everything that people want, a society must choose which goods and services to produce and in what quantities. This decision involves opportunity costs, as choosing to produce one good means forgoing the production of another."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_362.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 what is opportunity cost?\na the allocation of resources in an economy\nb _ the cost to the individual when they consume a good\nc the lack of goods and services available to satisfy unlimited wants\nd_ the next best alternative forgone when making an economic decision", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nOpportunity cost is a fundamental concept in economics that represents the value of the next-best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. Because resources (such as time, money, and materials) are scarce, individuals, firms, and governments must make decisions about how to allocate them. Every choice involves a trade-off. The opportunity cost is not the value of all possible alternatives forgone, but specifically the value of the single most desirable alternative that was not chosen. For example, if a government decides to spend money on building a new hospital, the opportunity cost is the value of the next best project it could have funded with that money, such as building new schools or improving the road network.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. the allocation of resources in an economy**\nThis describes the process of distributing and assigning an economy's factors of production (land, labour, capital, and enterprise) to produce different goods and services. While opportunity cost is a key consideration in the process of resource allocation, it is not the process itself. Resource allocation is about *what* is done with the resources, whereas opportunity cost is about *what is given up* as a consequence of that allocation decision.\n\n**B. the cost to the individual when they consume a good**\nThis typically refers to the monetary price paid by a consumer for a good or service. While the price is a component of the cost, opportunity cost is a broader concept. The true opportunity cost of consuming a good includes the value of the next best thing that could have been purchased with that same amount of money. For instance, the opportunity cost of buying a video game for \u00a350 is not just the \u00a350, but the enjoyment or utility you would have received from buying a pair of shoes, which was your second choice.\n\n**C. the lack of goods and services available to satisfy unlimited wants**\nThis is the definition of the fundamental economic problem, also known as scarcity. Scarcity is the condition where human wants for goods, services, and resources exceed what is available. It is because of scarcity that choices must be made, and it is the act of making a choice that gives rise to an opportunity cost. Therefore, scarcity is the underlying reason for opportunity cost, but it is not the definition of opportunity cost itself."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_363.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "3 the diagram shows a production possibility curve (ppc) for an economy that produces two goods,\nxand y.\nwhich point shows the greatest opportunity cost of producing one more unit of good x?\na\ngood y\nb\ncc\no good x", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good is the amount of the other good that must be foregone. On a Production Possibility Curve (PPC), this is represented by the slope of the curve. A steeper slope indicates a higher opportunity cost of producing the good on the horizontal axis (good X).\n\nThe PPC is bowed outwards (concave to the origin), which illustrates the principle of increasing opportunity cost. This means that as an economy produces more of one good, it must give up increasingly larger amounts of the other.\n\nAt point C, the economy is already producing a high quantity of good X and a low quantity of good Y. The resources still used to produce good Y are likely the most specialized and efficient for that task. To produce one more unit of good X, these highly efficient resources must be reallocated from Y-production, resulting in a large reduction in the output of good Y. The slope of the PPC is steepest at point C, indicating the highest opportunity cost for producing an additional unit of X.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **A:** At point A, the economy is producing a large amount of good Y and very little of good X. The slope of the PPC is relatively flat at this point. This means that to produce one more unit of good X, the economy only needs to give up a small amount of good Y. The resources being reallocated are likely not very efficient at producing good Y but are well-suited for producing good X. Therefore, point A represents the lowest opportunity cost of producing more X, not the greatest.\n\n*   **B:** Point B represents a combination of production somewhere between A and C. The slope of the curve at point B is steeper than at point A but flatter than at point C. This signifies that the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of good X at point B is higher than at point A but lower than at point C.\n\n*   **D:** Point D lies inside the PPC. This indicates that the economy is operating inefficiently, meaning resources are either unemployed or not used to their full potential. At point D, it is possible to increase the production of good X without decreasing the production of good Y (or even increasing both) by simply utilising resources more efficiently. Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of X when moving from point D towards the curve can be zero.

This means that at any given price, less rice is available for sale. In a supply and demand model, this is illustrated by a leftward shift of the supply curve. Assuming the demand for rice remains unchanged, this decrease in supply will lead to a new market equilibrium. At this new equilibrium, the quantity of rice exchanged is lower, and the price is higher. The reduction in the available quantity of rice is described as a shortage. Therefore, the effect on the market for rice is a shortage and a consequent rise in its price.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a shortage of rice and a fall in its price**\nWhile a crop failure does lead to a shortage (a lower quantity of rice available), it does not cause the price to fall. According to the law of supply, a decrease in the quantity supplied, with demand held constant, leads to an increase in the equilibrium price as consumers compete for the limited available goods. A fall in price would occur if supply increased or demand decreased, neither of which is the case here.\n\n**C: a surplus of rice and a fall in its price**\nThis option is incorrect on both points. A surplus occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. A crop failure causes a reduction in supply, leading to a shortage, not a surplus. Furthermore, a decrease in supply leads to a price rise, not a price fall. A surplus would put downward pressure on prices, but a crop failure creates the opposite market conditions.\n\n**D: a surplus of rice and a rise in its price**\nThis option incorrectly identifies a surplus. A failure of the rice crop reduces the amount of rice available, creating a shortage, not a surplus (an excess). While the price does rise, this price rise is a result of the shortage.

In economic theory, a change in the quantity supplied that results solely from a change in the product's own price is represented as a **movement along** the supply curve.

A **contraction** of supply occurs when the quantity supplied decreases, which happens when the price falls. In this scenario, the price has risen, leading to an increase in the quantity supplied. A movement **down** along the supply curve also corresponds to a decrease in price and quantity supplied.\n\n#### B: Supply will contract by 200 units and there will be an inward shift of the supply curve.\nThis is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the quantity supplied has increased, not contracted. Secondly, a **shift** of the supply curve (inward or outward) is caused by a change in a non-price determinant of supply, such as production costs, technology, or government subsidies.

The absolute value of -2 is 2. Since 2 is greater than 1, demand is price elastic. This means that the quantity demanded is highly responsive to changes in price; a 1% change in price leads to a greater than 1% change in quantity demanded.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: unitary**\nUnitary elasticity occurs when the absolute value of PED is exactly 1. This would mean that the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal in magnitude to the percentage change in price. In this case, the 50% decrease in quantity demanded is not equal to the 25% increase in price, so demand is not unitary.\n\n**C: less than 1**\nDemand is price inelastic when the absolute value of PED is less than 1. This happens when the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price. Here, the 50% decrease in demand is significantly larger than the 25% increase in price, indicating that demand is elastic, not inelastic.\n\n**D: zero**\nA PED of zero indicates perfectly inelastic demand. This would mean that a change in price has no effect on the quantity demanded (i.e., the percentage change in quantity demanded is 0%).

A food-ordering website is not a supplier of inputs; it is involved in the distribution of the final product.\n\n**B) conglomerate**\nA conglomerate merger is the joining of two or more firms that operate in completely different and unrelated industries.

In a low-income economy, capital is typically scarce and expensive, while labour is abundant and cheap, favouring labour-intensive methods. Grants from foreign aid programmes are non-repayable funds that can be used to purchase capital equipment. These grants effectively lower the cost of capital for firms, making investment in machinery and technology more affordable and financially viable. By reducing the primary barrier\u2014high cost\u2014foreign aid grants directly incentivise and enable firms to adopt capital-intensive production methods.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. expensive capital equipment costs:**\nHigh costs for capital equipment act as a disincentive, not an encouragement, for its use. Firms choose production methods based on the relative costs of factors of production (capital and labour). If capital equipment is expensive, firms will be more likely to choose the relatively cheaper alternative, which in a low-income economy is typically labour. Therefore, expensive capital would encourage labour-intensive, not capital-intensive, production.\n\n**C. supplies of local low-cost labour:**\nAn abundant supply of low-cost labour makes labour-intensive production methods more attractive and cost-effective for firms. When labour is cheap relative to capital, firms have a strong incentive to use more workers and less machinery to minimise their production costs. This situation discourages the adoption of capital-intensive techniques.\n\n**D. a shortage of highly trained supervisors:**\nCapital-intensive production often requires a skilled workforce, including highly trained supervisors, to operate, maintain, and manage complex machinery. A shortage of such skilled personnel creates a significant barrier to adopting these methods. Firms would be hesitant to invest in expensive technology if they lack the qualified staff to use it effectively and efficiently.

It is calculated as Total Revenue (TR) divided by Quantity (Q). A fundamental relationship in economics is that average revenue is always equal to the price (P) of the product (AR = TR/Q = (P \u00d7 Q)/Q = P). Given that the firm's average revenue is $20, the price of the product must also be $20.\n\n2.  **Total Revenue:** Total revenue (TR) is the total income a firm generates from selling its goods or services. It is calculated by multiplying the price per unit by the quantity of units sold (TR = P \u00d7 Q). Using the price we just determined ($20) and the given quantity (1000 units), the total revenue is:\n    TR = $20 \u00d7 1000 = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the firm's total revenue is $20,000 and the price of the product is $20.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option incorrectly states that total revenue is $20. While the price of $20 is correct (as Price = Average Revenue), the total revenue is calculated by multiplying this price by the quantity sold (1000 units). The total revenue is therefore $20,000, not $20.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect on both counts. It incorrectly identifies the price as $50, whereas the price must equal the average revenue of $20. It also incorrectly states the total revenue is $1000. Total revenue is calculated as Price \u00d7 Quantity, which would be $20 \u00d7 1000 = $20,000. The value of $1000 represents the quantity sold, not the total revenue.\n\n**D:** This option correctly calculates the total revenue as $20,000 ($20 \u00d7 1000).

Economies of scale are the cost advantages that a business obtains due to its scale of operation, resulting in a lower average cost per unit of output. By producing for the entire market, the monopolist can utilise mass production techniques, bulk-buy raw materials at a discount, and employ specialised capital and labour more efficiently than smaller competitive firms could. If these substantial cost savings are passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, it represents a potential advantage. While a monopolist has the power to raise prices, the ability to produce at a lower cost is a key characteristic, and in some cases (such as a natural monopoly), this can lead to lower prices for consumers than would be possible with multiple competing firms.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: consumer choice may increase**\nThis is incorrect. A defining characteristic of a monopoly is that there is only one producer or seller in the market. In contrast, a competitive industry consists of multiple firms competing against each other. When a competitive industry becomes a monopoly, the number of firms decreases, typically to one. This consolidation eliminates competition and reduces the variety of producers, brands, and product variations available to consumers, thereby leading to a decrease, not an increase, in consumer choice.\n\n**C: more goods may be produced**\nThis is incorrect. A key objective for a profit-maximising monopolist is to control supply to set a higher price. Compared to a perfectly competitive market, a monopolist typically restricts output to a level where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This results in a lower quantity of goods being supplied to the market at a higher price than would exist under competitive conditions. Therefore, the transition to a monopoly is associated with a reduction, not an increase, in the total quantity of goods produced.\n\n**D: prices may be set by market forces**\nThis is incorrect. Prices are set by market forces (the interaction of supply and demand) in a competitive market, where individual firms are \"price takers.\" A monopoly, however, is a \"price maker.\" As the sole supplier, the monopolist has significant market power and can influence or set the price by controlling the quantity of the good supplied.

It reflects the change in the actual volume of goods and services produced. The relationship between nominal GDP, real GDP, and inflation can be approximated as:\n\n*   **Growth Rate of Real GDP \u2248 Growth Rate of Nominal GDP - Inflation Rate**\n\nFor real GDP to rise, its growth rate must be positive. This occurs when the growth rate of nominal GDP (the value of output at current prices) is greater than the rate of inflation (the rate at which the general price level is rising). If nominal GDP increases faster than prices, it signifies a genuine increase in the quantity of goods and services produced, leading to a rise in real GDP.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. nominal GDP rising at a faster rate than employment**\nThis statement is incorrect because the relationship between nominal GDP and employment does not directly determine the change in real GDP. Real GDP is determined by adjusting nominal GDP for inflation, not for changes in employment. For instance, nominal GDP could increase by 5% while employment increases by 2%. However, if the inflation rate is 6%, real GDP would fall (5% - 6% = -1%), even though nominal GDP grew faster than employment.\n\n**C. nominal GDP rising faster than the population**\nThis condition relates to GDP per capita, not total real GDP. Real GDP per capita is a measure of the average economic output per person and is used to indicate average living standards. For *real GDP per capita* to rise, real GDP must grow faster than the population. However, the question asks what causes *real GDP* to rise. It is possible for nominal GDP to rise faster than the population, but if inflation is higher still, total real GDP will fall.\n\n**D. nominal GDP rising**\nA rise in nominal GDP alone is insufficient to guarantee a rise in real GDP. Nominal GDP can increase simply because of rising prices (inflation), even if the actual quantity of goods and services produced remains the same or decreases. For example, if nominal GDP rises by 3% but the inflation rate is 5%, real GDP has actually fallen by approximately 2%.

These policies, which include measures like deregulation, privatisation, investment in education and training, and tax incentives for businesses, improve the efficiency and quantity of the factors of production. By increasing the economy's potential output, supply-side policies can lead to sustainable economic growth (a higher real GDP). Crucially, this growth is achieved without the inflationary pressures associated with demand-side policies. In fact, an increase in aggregate supply can put downward pressure on the general price level, thus helping to achieve price stability. Therefore, supply-side policy is the most likely tool to achieve both economic growth and price stability simultaneously.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) fiscal policy**\n\nFiscal policy involves the use of government spending and taxation to manage aggregate demand (AD). To stimulate economic growth, a government would typically implement an expansionary fiscal policy (increasing spending or cutting taxes). While this shifts the AD curve to the right and increases real GDP, it also tends to increase the general price level, causing inflation and undermining price stability. Conversely, to achieve price stability, a government would use contractionary fiscal policy (decreasing spending or raising taxes), which would reduce AD and slow down economic growth. This demonstrates a clear trade-off between the two objectives when using fiscal policy.\n\n**B) import barriers**\n\nImport barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, are protectionist policies that restrict the flow of goods into a country. These policies typically lead to higher prices for consumers, as imported goods become more expensive and domestic producers face less competition. Furthermore, if the imported goods are raw materials or components used by domestic firms, these barriers increase production costs. This can lead to cost-push inflation and a decrease in the economy's aggregate supply, resulting in lower economic growth (or even economic contraction) and higher prices (inflation). Therefore, import barriers are counterproductive to achieving the twin goals of economic growth and price stability.\n\n**C) monetary policy**\n\nMonetary policy, conducted by a central bank, uses tools like interest rates to manage aggregate demand (AD). To encourage economic growth, the central bank would implement an expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates. This stimulates borrowing for consumption and investment, shifting the AD curve to the right. However, this increase in demand typically leads to demand-pull inflation, conflicting with the goal of price stability. To maintain price stability, the central bank would use a contractionary policy (raising interest rates), which dampens aggregate demand and slows economic growth.

It is an increase in the general level of prices over time.**\nThis statement describes inflation, not economic growth. Inflation is a macroeconomic concept that refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling.

It is an increase in the level of total demand over time.**\nThis statement describes an increase in aggregate demand. Aggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time.

Economic growth, in its fundamental sense, refers to the expansion of the economy's supply-side capacity (long-run aggregate supply).\n\n**D. It is an increase in wages, interest, profits and rent over time.**\nThis statement describes an increase in national income. Wages, interest, profits, and rent are the factor payments made to labour, capital, enterprise, and land, respectively. The sum of these factor incomes is one way to calculate national income. While national income typically rises as a result of economic growth, this is a measure of the monetary value generated, not the fundamental definition of growth, which is centred on the real volume of output.

During a recession, which is a temporary downturn in economic activity, the overall demand for goods and services in the economy (aggregate demand) falls. Since the demand for labour by firms is a derived demand\u2014meaning it depends on the demand for the products they sell\u2014a fall in aggregate demand leads to a corresponding decrease in the demand for labour. Firms reduce production and lay off workers to cut costs. Because recessions are a temporary phase of the business cycle, this decrease in the demand for labour is also temporary. When the economy enters a recovery phase, demand for labour increases again, and cyclical unemployment falls.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: a permanent decrease in the demand for labour**\nA permanent decrease in the demand for labour is associated with structural unemployment, not cyclical unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from long-term changes in the economy, such as technological advancements that make certain skills obsolete or the permanent decline of an entire industry. This creates a mismatch between the skills of the available workforce and the skills required by employers. Unlike cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment persists even when the economy is not in a recession.\n\n**B: a permanent decrease in the supply of labour**\nA decrease in the supply of labour means there are fewer people able and willing to work. A permanent decrease could be caused by demographic shifts, such as an aging population and a rising retirement rate. This would not cause unemployment. In fact, a reduced supply of labour, all other things being equal, would likely lead to lower unemployment and upward pressure on wages, as firms compete for a smaller pool of workers. This is the opposite of the situation in a recession.\n\n**D: a temporary decrease in the supply of labour**\nA temporary decrease in the supply of labour would mean fewer people are seeking work for a short period. This does not cause unemployment. Cyclical unemployment occurs because there are not enough jobs available for the people who want to work (a lack of demand), not because there is a shortage of workers (a lack of supply).

Cyclical unemployment rises during an economic downturn or recession. This affects the government's budget in two key ways, known as the operation of automatic stabilisers:\n\n1.  **Increased Government Expenditure:** As more people become unemployed, government spending on unemployment benefits and other welfare payments automatically increases. The data shows government expenditure rising from $500bn to $700bn, which is consistent with this effect.\n2.  **Decreased Tax Revenue:** Higher unemployment means fewer people are earning incomes, leading to a fall in revenue from income taxes. Furthermore, an economic downturn reduces corporate profits (lowering corporation tax revenue) and overall consumer spending (lowering revenue from indirect taxes like VAT or sales tax). The data shows tax revenue falling from $500bn to $300bn, which aligns with this outcome.\n\nThe combined effect is a move from a balanced budget (Year 1) to a growing budget deficit (Years 2 and 3), as shown in the table.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) a fall in the dependency ratio**\n\nA fall in the dependency ratio means there are fewer non-working people (e.g., children and retirees) relative to the working-age population.

A larger workforce would generate more income tax revenue, while fewer dependents would reduce government expenditure on state pensions, child benefits, and related services. This is the opposite of the trend shown, where tax revenue falls and expenditure rises.\n\n**B) a fall in the exchange rate**\n\nA fall in the exchange rate (depreciation) makes a country's exports cheaper for foreigners and its imports more expensive for domestic consumers. This could potentially boost net exports, leading to an increase in aggregate demand and economic growth. Economic growth would typically increase tax revenues and reduce unemployment-related expenditure, improving the budget balance. While a lower exchange rate could increase the cost of government imports or foreign debt repayments, its overall effect is unlikely to cause both a sharp rise in total expenditure and a sharp fall in tax revenue as depicted.\n\n**D) an increase in real GDP**\n\nAn increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) signifies economic growth. During a period of economic growth, unemployment typically falls, and household incomes and corporate profits rise.

Countries with high average wages, such as Switzerland, typically have a workforce that is, on average, more productive due to factors like higher levels of education and skills (human capital), greater access to advanced technology, and more capital investment per worker. This increased productivity is a primary driver of higher earnings.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. A greater percentage of workers in Switzerland work part-time than in Mexico.**\n\nThis is unlikely to be the cause of higher average earnings. Part-time workers, by definition, work fewer hours than full-time workers. All else being equal, this would lead to lower total annual earnings compared to full-time employees. If a larger proportion of the workforce is part-time, it would tend to *lower* the national average earnings, not raise them. Therefore, this factor would work in the opposite direction of the stated observation.\n\n**C. The average worker in Switzerland pays more income tax than the average worker in Mexico.**\n\nThis statement confuses cause and effect. Income tax is a deduction from earnings; it does not determine the level of those earnings. The amount of income tax paid is a *consequence* of the wage earned, not a cause of it. A worker in Switzerland earns a high wage first, and as a result, pays a higher amount of income tax. High taxes are not a reason for high pre-tax wages.\n\n**D. The unemployment rate is higher in Switzerland than in Mexico.**\n\nA higher unemployment rate would likely lead to lower, not higher, average wages. High unemployment indicates an excess supply of labour relative to the demand for it. This increases competition among workers for available jobs, which reduces the bargaining power of labour and puts downward pressure on wage rates. Conversely, a low unemployment rate (a 'tight' labour market) tends to push wages up as firms must compete to attract a smaller pool of available workers."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_385.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 the table contains details on birth rate, death rate and net migration for several countries in a year.\nmigration\n\naustralia 13 7 850000\nbrazil 14 6 30000\nnigeria 39 12 \u2014300 000\nus 12 8 4500000\n\nwhat can be concluded from the table?\n\na_ only one country, nigeria, had a decreasing population.\n\nb_ the country with the lowest birth rate had the lowest death rate.\n\nc_ the country with the lowest death rate had the highest birth rate.\n\nd_ the country with the lowest natural rate of increase in population was the us.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe **natural rate of increase** in population is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate (Natural Rate of Increase = Birth Rate - Death Rate).

Therefore, this conclusion is supported by the data in the table.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Only one country, Nigeria, had a decreasing population.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The overall population change is determined by both the natural increase and net migration. All four countries have a positive natural rate of increase (births exceed deaths). While Nigeria has negative net migration (more people leaving than arriving), its natural rate of increase is very high (27 per 1000). This high rate of natural increase almost certainly outweighs the loss from emigration, leading to an overall population increase. The other three countries have both a positive natural increase and positive net migration, meaning their populations are definitely increasing. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that any country, let alone only Nigeria, had a decreasing population.\n\n**B: The country with the lowest birth rate had the lowest death rate.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The country with the lowest birth rate is the US (12 per 1000). However, the country with the lowest death rate is Brazil (6 per 1000).

This is reflected in several key indicators:\n\n*   **High GDP per head (US$)**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head is a primary measure of a country's economic wealth divided by its population. A high value indicates a high average income and a high level of production of goods and services per person.\n*   **High Human Development Index (HDI) value**: The HDI is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education (mean and expected years of schooling), and per capita income indicators. A high HDI value signifies that the country has a long and healthy life, is well-educated, and has a high standard of living. High-income countries typically invest heavily in healthcare and education, leading to high HDI scores.\n*   **High percentage of the labour force in the tertiary sector**: As an economy develops, it undergoes structural change. It moves from a reliance on the primary sector (agriculture and extraction) to the secondary sector (manufacturing), and finally to the tertiary sector (services). High-income economies are service-based, with a large proportion of the workforce employed in areas such as finance, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.\n\nTherefore, the combination of high GDP per head, high HDI, and a high percentage of the labour force in the tertiary sector accurately describes a high-income economy.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because it states that a high-income economy has a low percentage of its labour force in the tertiary sector. In reality, a dominant tertiary (service) sector is a defining feature of a high-income, developed economy. A low percentage of employment in the tertiary sector is more characteristic of a developing or middle-income economy, where the secondary (manufacturing) or primary (agricultural) sector is more prominent.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because it describes a high-income economy as having a low GDP per head and a low Human Development Index (HDI) value. These are characteristics of a low-income, less-developed economy, not a high-income one. While it correctly identifies that a high-income economy has a high percentage of its labour force in the tertiary sector, the other two indicators are incorrect.\n\n**D:** This option describes the characteristics of a low-income, less-developed economy, which is the opposite of a high-income economy. A low GDP per head, a low HDI value, and a low percentage of the labour force in the tertiary sector (implying a dominance of the primary or secondary sectors) are all classic indicators of a country with a low level of economic development and a lower standard of living."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_387.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "27 what might encourage international specialisation between countries?\na free trade\nb _ inefficiencies in production\nc labour immobility\nd tariffs", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nInternational specialisation occurs when countries focus on producing the goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage\u2014meaning they can produce them at a lower opportunity cost than other nations. Free trade, which is the absence of trade barriers like tariffs and quotas, is a key driver of this process. It allows countries to sell their specialised products on the global market and, in turn, import goods that other countries produce more efficiently. This exchange enables all participating countries to benefit from lower prices and a greater variety of goods, providing a powerful incentive to specialise.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. inefficiencies in production**\nSpecialisation is based on the principle of comparative advantage, which arises from relative *efficiency* in production, not inefficiency. A country specialises in producing goods where it is most efficient relative to other countries. General inefficiencies in production would make a country's goods more expensive and less competitive, thereby discouraging, rather than encouraging, its ability to specialise and export successfully.\n\n**C. labour immobility**\nLabour immobility, the difficulty workers face in moving between different jobs, industries, or geographical locations, is a barrier to specialisation. For a country to specialise, it must be able to shift its factors of production, including labour, from declining industries to expanding ones. If workers cannot easily acquire new skills or move to where the jobs are, it hinders the country's ability to adapt and restructure its economy towards its areas of comparative advantage.\n\n**D. tariffs**\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They are a form of protectionism designed to shield domestic industries from foreign competition by making imports more expensive. This directly discourages international specialisation because it reduces the incentive to import goods from countries that can produce them more cheaply. By creating barriers to trade, tariffs prevent countries from fully exploiting the benefits of specialising and trading based on comparative advantage."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_388.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "28 a government wishes to stop the dumping of a specific imported good at a very low price.\nwhich method of protection would be most effective?\na apply an embargo to this good\nb_ devalue the currency\nc increase interest rates\nd provide subsidies to home producers of this good", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAn embargo is a government order that restricts commerce or exchange with a specified country or on specific goods. By applying an embargo to the specific good being dumped, the government would completely ban its importation. This is the most direct and absolute method to \"stop\" the dumping, as it reduces the quantity of the imported good to zero, thereby eliminating the problem entirely for the domestic market.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B) devalue the currency**\nDevaluing the currency is a macroeconomic policy that makes all imports more expensive and all exports cheaper. While this would increase the price of the dumped good, it is not a targeted solution. It affects trade in all goods and services, which can lead to widespread inflation and disrupt other sectors of the economy. Furthermore, if the foreign firm is dumping at a price significantly below its production cost, the effect of the devaluation may not be sufficient to make the domestic product competitive. Therefore, it is not the most effective or appropriate tool for a problem concerning a single, specific good.\n\n**C) increase interest rates**\nIncreasing interest rates is a monetary policy tool typically used to control inflation or manage capital flows. Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign financial investment, which increases the demand for the domestic currency and causes it to appreciate. A stronger (appreciated) currency makes imports cheaper. This would actually make the dumped good even more affordable in the domestic market, worsening the problem for home producers, not solving it.\n\n**D) provide subsidies to home producers of this good**\nA subsidy is a payment from the government to domestic producers. This lowers their cost of production, allowing them to sell their goods at a lower price and compete more effectively against the dumped imports. However, this method does not stop the dumping itself; the cheap imported goods are still entering the country. It only mitigates the impact on domestic firms. This approach also incurs a direct cost to the government and taxpayers and may not be as definitive as a complete ban."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_389.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "29 the price of the us dollar in terms of other currencies is set by the forces of demand and supply.\nto what does this statement refer?\na analternative method of trade protection\nb__ the determination of the exchange rate in a fixed exchange rate system\nc__ the determination of the exchange rate in a floating exchange rate system\nd _ the increasing globalisation of international trade", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA **floating exchange rate system** is one in which a currency's value is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The \"price\" of a currency, known as its exchange rate, is not set by government intervention but is allowed to fluctuate freely. For example, if the demand for US dollars increases (perhaps due to higher foreign demand for US exports or assets), the price of the dollar will rise (appreciate). Conversely, if the supply of US dollars on the market increases (perhaps because US citizens are buying more imports), its price will fall (depreciate). The statement in the question directly describes this market-based mechanism.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Trade protection refers to government policies, such as tariffs or quotas, that are designed to restrict international trade and protect domestic industries from foreign competition. While a country might manipulate its exchange rate as a form of protectionism, the fundamental mechanism of letting demand and supply determine the exchange rate is a feature of a country's monetary system, not a method of trade protection itself.\n\n**B:** In a **fixed exchange rate system**, the government or central bank sets a specific target value for its currency, often \"pegging\" it to another currency or a commodity like gold. The central bank must actively intervene in the foreign exchange market, buying or selling its currency, to maintain this fixed rate. This is the opposite of the situation described, where the rate is determined by market forces of demand and supply without such intervention.\n\n**D:** Globalisation refers to the increasing interconnectedness of economies through the growth of international trade, investment, and capital flows. While increasing globalisation is a major driver of the demand for and supply of currencies, it is a broad economic trend, not the specific system for determining exchange rates.

Gold is a prime example of a scarce resource. It is a naturally occurring precious metal, and the total amount available on Earth is finite. It must be discovered, mined, and refined, all of which are costly and time-consuming processes. Because the supply of gold is limited, while the demand for it (for use in jewelry, as an investment, and in industry) is extensive, choices must be made about how it is allocated and used. This scarcity is the root cause of the economic problem in the market for gold.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A: Consumer wants for gold are limited.**\nThis statement is contrary to a basic principle of economics, which assumes that human wants are generally unlimited. While an individual's desire for gold might be satisfied at a certain point, the collective wants of society for gold are vast and effectively insatiable. Gold has been a symbol of wealth, status, and beauty for millennia, and it also has important industrial and technological applications. Therefore, overall consumer and industrial wants for gold are not considered limited.\n\n**C: Only governments can sell gold.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The global gold market is comprised of a wide range of participants. While central banks (which are government institutions) are major holders and traders of gold, the market also includes mining companies, refineries, financial institutions, jewelers, industrial corporations, and private individuals. All of these entities can and do buy and sell gold, making the market accessible to many different parties, not just governments.\n\n**D: There is an unlimited supply of gold.**\nThis statement is the opposite of reality. Gold is a finite natural resource. The total quantity of gold that can be mined from the Earth's crust is limited. If the supply of gold were unlimited, it would not be scarce, and therefore would not be a precious or valuable commodity.

To eliminate this shortage, the market must move towards equilibrium, where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

A fall in the quantity demanded directly reduces the excess demand, closing the gap between what consumers wish to buy and what producers are willing to sell, thereby helping to eliminate the shortage.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n*   **B:** A fall in price would exacerbate, not eliminate, a market shortage. According to the law of demand, a lower price increases the quantity demanded. According to the law of supply, a lower price decreases the quantity supplied. Therefore, a fall in price would widen the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied, making the shortage more severe. The natural market adjustment to a shortage is for the price to rise, not fall.\n\n*   **C:** A fall in the quantity supplied would worsen a market shortage.

The price elasticity of supply (PES) for a perfectly inelastic good is zero (PES = 0), indicating that there is no responsiveness in quantity supplied to a change in price.\n\nThis situation is represented graphically by a vertical supply curve. The line is parallel to the price axis. As can be seen with line B, the quantity is fixed at a certain level. Any increase or decrease in price (moving up or down the vertical axis) will not result in a change in the quantity supplied (the position on the horizontal axis does not change).

This means that as the price of a good falls, the quantity increases, and vice versa. This relationship represents a demand curve, which shows the behaviour of consumers, not producers. A supply curve shows the relationship between price and the quantity producers are willing to sell, which is typically a positive (or zero, in the case of perfectly inelastic supply) relationship. Therefore, line A represents a demand curve, not a supply curve.\n\n**C) Incorrect**\n\nAn upward-sloping line, such as line C, shows a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied. This means that as the price increases, producers are willing and able to supply more of the good. This represents a typical supply curve where supply is responsive to price changes. Depending on the steepness of the line, it could represent relatively elastic supply (PES > 1) or relatively inelastic supply (0 < PES < 1), but it is not perfectly inelastic because the quantity supplied does change as the price changes.\n\n**D) Incorrect**\n\nA horizontal line on a price-quantity diagram represents perfectly elastic supply (PES = \u221e). This indicates that producers are willing to supply any quantity of the good at a specific price, but they will supply nothing at a lower price. The responsiveness of quantity supplied to a price change is infinite.

This occurs when interest rates are high, the inflation rate is low, and the unemployment rate is low.\n\n*   **High Interest Rate:** A high interest rate increases the reward for saving. Banks and financial institutions offer a greater return on deposits, making saving more attractive than current consumption. The opportunity cost of spending money increases, thus incentivising households to save more to benefit from the higher returns.\n\n*   **Low Inflation Rate:** A low inflation rate ensures that the real value (purchasing power) of saved money is preserved. When inflation is high, the prices of goods and services rise rapidly, eroding the value of money over time. If the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate, the real return on savings becomes negative, discouraging people from saving. Conversely, low inflation provides confidence that savings will retain their value, making it a more secure and rational choice.\n\n*   **Low Unemployment Rate:** A low unemployment rate signifies a strong economy where a large proportion of the workforce is employed. This leads to higher and more stable household incomes, which increases the *capacity* to save. When people feel secure in their jobs and have sufficient disposable income, they are better able to set money aside for the future.\n\n**Analysis of Other Scenarios:**\n\n*   A **high inflation rate** would discourage saving, as it erodes the future purchasing power of money, even if interest rates are high. The real return on savings could be low or even negative.\n*   A **high unemployment rate** would reduce the overall ability of households to save. With fewer people earning an income and widespread job insecurity, aggregate household income falls, leaving less money available for saving, regardless of the interest rate.\n*   A **low interest rate** provides little incentive to save.

Improving the working conditions of nurses is a non-monetary incentive that makes the profession more attractive. Better conditions, such as more manageable working hours, a safer environment, better staff-to-patient ratios, and greater professional support, increase job satisfaction. This not only encourages more people to enter the profession but also improves the retention rate of existing nurses, reducing the number who leave for other jobs or due to burnout. Consequently, improving working conditions is an effective method for increasing the overall supply of nurses.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. extending the training period for nurses**\nThis action would likely decrease, not increase, the supply of nurses. A longer training period increases the opportunity cost of becoming a nurse, as individuals must spend more time in education and out of the full-time workforce. This delay in earning a full salary, combined with the extended period of study, would act as a disincentive, discouraging potential candidates from choosing nursing as a career.\n\n**C. increasing the national minimum wage**\nAn increase in the national minimum wage is unlikely to affect the supply of nurses. The national minimum wage sets a legal price floor for the lowest-paid workers in an economy. Nurses are skilled professionals whose wages are typically set well above this minimum level. Therefore, a change in the minimum wage would not directly impact their earnings or the financial attractiveness of the profession.\n\n**D. reducing grants for trainee nurses**\nThis policy would decrease the supply of nurses. Grants are a form of financial assistance that reduces the cost of training. By reducing these grants, the financial burden on aspiring nurses would increase. This would make it more difficult for individuals to afford the necessary education, acting as a significant barrier to entry and discouraging people from joining the profession, thereby reducing the future supply."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_403.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "13 employers based in large cities often pay employees special allowances above standard pay rates.\nwhat is the most likely reason for this?\na job security and promotion prospects tend to be restricted.\nb living costs and transport costs tend to be high.\nc_ there are few alternative job opportunities available.\nd_ trade unions negotiate nationwide wage levels.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nLiving costs, particularly for housing, and transport costs are significantly higher in large cities compared to smaller towns or rural areas. This is due to greater demand for limited space and resources. To attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, firms must offer higher nominal wages. These special allowances, often called cost-of-living adjustments or city weighting, are necessary to ensure that the real wage (the purchasing power of the wage) is competitive with what employees could earn elsewhere. Without these allowances, the higher cost of living would erode the value of an employee's salary, making it difficult for them to afford a reasonable standard of life and making jobs in other, cheaper locations more attractive.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Job security and promotion prospects tend to be restricted.**\nThis statement is generally incorrect. Large cities are major economic centres with a high concentration and diversity of firms. This typically creates a dynamic labour market with more, not fewer, job opportunities and a wider range of career paths. The abundance of potential employers often leads to greater promotion prospects (both within a firm and by moving to another) and can even enhance a worker's sense of job security, as finding alternative employment is often easier than in areas with fewer employers.\n\n**C. There are few alternative job opportunities available.**\nThis is the opposite of the economic reality in most large cities. Large urban areas are defined by the density and variety of their industries, which creates a large and competitive labour market with numerous alternative job opportunities. If there were few alternatives, employers would have more market power over workers (a situation known as monopsony power), which would tend to depress wages rather than increase them, as workers would have less bargaining power.\n\n**D. Trade unions negotiate nationwide wage levels.**\nIf trade unions negotiated a single, uniform wage level for the entire nation, this would lead to wage standardisation across all geographical areas. This would work against the practice of paying special allowances in large cities. In reality, while some trade unions do negotiate on a national scale, these agreements often specifically include provisions for regional pay variations, such as \"London weighting\" in the UK, precisely to account for the higher cost of living in major cities. Therefore, a simple nationwide wage level would explain wage equality, not the regional differences mentioned in the question."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_404.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "14 workers in a country have been concerned about their wages not keeping pace with inflation.\nhow can trade unions assist workers in getting a pay rise?\na advise the workers to ask individually for a pay rise\nb negotiate on behalf of their members to secure a pay rise\nc offer to contribute financially to a pay rise\nd request improved working conditions", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "***\n### Correct Answer: B\n\nA primary function of a trade union is to engage in collective bargaining. This is the process where the union, representing its members as a single entity, negotiates with employers over wages, working hours, and other conditions of employment. By bargaining collectively, the union wields significantly more power than an individual worker would. This increased bargaining power enables the union to effectively negotiate for a pay rise on behalf of its members, helping their wages to keep pace with or exceed the rate of inflation.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. advise the workers to ask individually for a pay rise**\nThis is incorrect because the fundamental purpose of a trade union is to leverage collective strength. Advising workers to negotiate individually would negate the union's primary advantage. Individual workers typically have much less bargaining power than their employer, making it difficult for them to secure significant pay rises alone. The union's role is to bargain for the group, not to delegate this crucial task back to individuals.\n\n**C. offer to contribute financially to a pay rise**\nThis is incorrect as it misunderstands the financial role of a trade union and the nature of wage negotiations. Trade unions are funded by their members' subscriptions. These funds are used for administrative costs, legal support, and to provide financial support to members during industrial action (e.g., strike pay). A union's goal is to compel the employer to increase wages from the firm's revenues, not to subsidise the employer's wage bill with the members' own money.\n\n**D. request improved working conditions**\nWhile negotiating for improved working conditions (such as better health and safety or more reasonable hours) is an important function of a trade union, it does not directly address the specific issue of wages failing to keep pace with inflation. The question explicitly asks how a union can help workers get a *pay rise*. Although pay and conditions are often negotiated together, a request for improved working conditions is a separate goal from securing a wage increase."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_405.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "15 howis total revenue calculated?\na price divided by the total output\nb total output divided by the price\nc total output multiplied by the price\nd total output multiplied by total costs", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nTotal revenue is the entire amount of income a firm generates from the sale of its goods or services.

Therefore, multiplying the total output by the price per unit gives the firm's total income from its sales.

This causes a decrease in the overall market supply of snacks and drinks.\n\n*   **Effect on Prices:** According to the laws of supply and demand, a decrease in supply, with demand remaining constant, leads to a shortage at the original price. This puts upward pressure on prices. The remaining caf\u00e9s face less competition and can therefore charge higher prices for their products. This leads to a new, higher equilibrium price in the market.\n\n*   **Effect on Profits:** The remaining caf\u00e9s benefit from two factors. Firstly, they can sell their goods at a higher price. Secondly, they will likely serve a larger number of customers, as the patrons of the closed caf\u00e9s seek alternatives.

This increase in revenue is highly likely to exceed any associated increase in total costs, resulting in higher profits for the remaining caf\u00e9s.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Prices decrease, Profits decrease**\nThis is incorrect. A reduction in the number of suppliers (less competition) leads to an increase in prices, not a decrease. Consequently, with higher prices and a larger share of the market, the profits of the remaining firms are likely to increase, not decrease.\n\n**B: Prices decrease, Profits increase**\nThis is incorrect because prices are expected to rise, not fall. A decrease in market supply and competition allows the remaining firms to increase their prices. While profits are likely to increase, it is a result of higher prices, not lower ones.\n\n**C: Prices increase, Profits decrease**\nWhile the effect on prices is correct, the effect on profits is incorrect. An increase in price, coupled with an increase in the number of customers captured from the closed competitors, will almost certainly lead to higher total revenue.

Macroeconomics deals with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. Governments aim to maintain a low and stable rate of inflation because high or volatile inflation can have several negative consequences. It can erode the real value of savings and incomes, create uncertainty for businesses and consumers, discourage investment, and reduce the international competitiveness of a country's exports. Therefore, controlling inflation is a key focus of both fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: equilibrium prices in markets**\nThis is a concept from microeconomics, not a macroeconomic aim of the government. Microeconomics focuses on individual markets and the behaviour of individual economic agents (firms and households). While free markets tend to move towards equilibrium prices through the interaction of supply and demand, and this is generally considered efficient, it is not a direct, overarching policy goal for the government at the macroeconomic level. In fact, governments sometimes intervene in specific markets to set prices above or below equilibrium (e.g., minimum wages or price ceilings on essential goods) to achieve other social or economic objectives.\n\n**B: high wages**\nWhile a government desires a high standard of living for its citizens, which includes rising wages, \"high wages\" as a standalone objective is not a primary macroeconomic aim. This is because wage increases that are not supported by corresponding increases in productivity can lead to negative macroeconomic consequences, such as cost-push inflation and unemployment, as firms' costs rise. A more accurate macroeconomic objective is achieving full employment and sustainable economic growth, which, in turn, typically leads to higher real wages over time.\n\n**D: profit maximisation**\nProfit maximisation is the primary objective of private sector firms, not the government. Firms operate to generate profits for their owners or shareholders. The government, on the other hand, is a public sector institution with broader objectives focused on social welfare. These aims include providing public services (like defence and healthcare), redistributing income, correcting market failures, and managing the overall economy to achieve goals like low inflation, low unemployment, and economic growth."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_408.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "18 the table shows earnings and total income tax paid per year.\ntotal income tax paid $\n\n5000 1000\n8000 2000\n9000 3000\n\nwhich type of tax system does this illustrate?\n\na _ indirect\n\nb progressive\n\nc proportional\n\nd_ regressive", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nA progressive tax system is one in which the average tax rate increases as the taxpayer's income increases.

The resulting figure would be artificially inflated and would not accurately represent the average economic output available to each person in the society.\n\n**B. the dependent population**\nThe dependent population consists of individuals who are not in the workforce and rely on others for economic support, primarily children and retired persons. Dividing the total GDP by this specific, non-working segment of the population would produce an economically meaningless and disproportionately high figure. This calculation does not serve the purpose of measuring the average standard of living or output for the nation as a whole.\n\n**D. the working population**\nDividing GDP by the working population calculates a different, though also important, economic indicator: labour productivity (or GDP per worker). This metric measures the average output produced by each employed person and is used to assess the efficiency of a country's workforce. However, it is not the same as GDP per head, which is intended to be a broader measure of the average standard of living for the entire population, including those who are not employed (the unemployed and dependents)."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_411.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "21 what is the consequence of economic growth for individuals and for the economy?\nse\na increase in absolute poverty increase in inflation\nb increase in average incomes increase in government tax revenue\nc | increase in the variety of goods and services reduction in exports\nd increase in unemployment reduction in the standard of living", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nEconomic growth, defined as an increase in a country's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has significant positive consequences for both individuals and the wider economy. For individuals, growth in national output translates into higher national income. This generally leads to an increase in average incomes, allowing people greater purchasing power and the ability to afford more goods and services, thus improving their material standard of living. For the economy, this expansion of economic activity\u2014higher incomes, increased corporate profits, and greater consumer spending\u2014broadens the government's tax base. Consequently, government tax revenue from sources such as income tax, corporation tax, and value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax will increase, enabling more public spending on services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. A primary benefit of economic growth is the reduction, not the increase, of absolute poverty. As the economy expands, more jobs are created and incomes rise, lifting people above the absolute poverty line. While rapid economic growth can sometimes lead to demand-pull inflation, the claim that it increases absolute poverty is contrary to historical evidence and economic principles.\n\n**C:** While economic growth can lead to an \"increase in the variety of goods and services\" due to innovation and investment, the second part of this statement, \"reduction in exports,\" is generally incorrect. Economic growth typically enhances a country's productive capacity, potentially making its industries more efficient and competitive on the global stage. This often leads to an increase, not a reduction, in the volume of exports.\n\n**D:** This option describes outcomes that are the opposite of the goals and typical results of economic growth. Economic growth leads to higher demand for labour as businesses expand production, which causes a decrease, not an increase, in unemployment. Similarly, by increasing the average income and the availability of goods and services, economic growth leads to a rise, not a reduction, in the average standard of living."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_412.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "22 what does the labour force survey (lfs) measure?\na __ the number of workers on the national minimum wage\nb _ the proportion of women in the labour force\nc_ the unemployed population\nd trade union membership", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a major household survey used by governments and economists to measure the state of the labour market. Its primary function is to classify the working-age population into three categories: employed, unemployed, or economically inactive. It uses the internationally agreed-upon definition from the International Labour Organization (ILO) to define unemployment. An individual is counted as unemployed if they are currently without work, have been actively seeking work, and are available to start a job. Consequently, the LFS is the main tool for measuring the unemployed population and calculating the official unemployment rate for a country.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. the number of workers on the national minimum wage**\nWhile the LFS often collects data on earnings, its primary purpose is not to specifically identify and count the number of individuals earning the national minimum wage. This information is typically a by-product of the survey rather than its main objective. More direct administrative data, such as payroll or tax records, are often used to track compliance with and the impact of the minimum wage.\n\n**B. the proportion of women in the labour force**\nThe LFS does collect demographic data, including gender. This allows for the calculation of various statistics, such as the proportion of women who are employed or unemployed. However, this is a form of secondary analysis of the data. The fundamental purpose of the survey is to measure the overall employment and unemployment figures for the entire population, not just a specific demographic segment, making option C a more accurate description of what the survey measures at its core.\n\n**D. trade union membership**\nSome versions of the Labour Force Survey may include questions about trade union membership to gather broader information about the labour market. However, this is not the survey's central focus. The core mission of the LFS is to provide the headline figures on employment and unemployment, which are critical for economic policy-making. Data on trade union membership is an ancillary topic, not the primary measure."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_413.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 the table shows the weights allocated to the three items in a consumer prices index (cpi) for two\nyears.\n-\nitem\nfood 30 35\nclothing 20 15\nhousing 50 50\nwhat can be concluded from this data?\na_ clothing prices have fallen.\nb living standards remain unchanged.\nc_ the average price level is unchanged.\nd_ the proportion of income spent on food has risen.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nThe weights in a Consumer Prices Index (CPI) represent the proportion of average household expenditure allocated to a specific category of goods or services. The table shows that the weight for food increased from 30 in year 1 to 35 in year 2. This directly signifies that, on average, households are now spending a larger percentage of their total expenditure on food.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) Clothing prices have fallen.**\nThis conclusion is not supported by the data. The table shows that the *weight* for clothing has fallen from 20 to 15, which means the *proportion of expenditure* on clothing has decreased. However, expenditure is determined by both price and the quantity purchased. A lower proportion of spending on clothing could be due to lower prices, but it could also be due to consumers buying fewer clothes, perhaps because of a change in tastes or a rise in the price of other essential goods like food. Without information on prices or quantities, one cannot conclude that clothing prices have fallen.\n\n**B) Living standards remain unchanged.**\nThe data is insufficient to make any judgement about living standards. Living standards relate to the level of wealth, comfort, material goods, and necessities available to a certain socioeconomic class or a certain geographic area. To assess changes in living standards, one would need information on factors such as real income (income adjusted for inflation), the overall price level, and the quantity and quality of goods and services consumed. The table only shows the changing composition of consumer spending, not the purchasing power or overall well-being of consumers.\n\n**C) The average price level is unchanged.**\nThe data in the table (the weights) is only one component used to calculate the CPI, which measures the change in the average price level. To calculate the CPI, these weights must be applied to the price changes of the individual items in the basket. The table provides no information about the prices of food, clothing, or housing in either year. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the average price level has risen, fallen, or remained unchanged."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_414.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "24 a government increases the rate of progressive income tax and its spending on hospitals.\nwhat is likely to happen to the distribution of income and to living standards?\n| | distribution of income living standards\na becomes less even fall\nb becomes less even rise\ncc becomes more even fall\nd becomes more even rise", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nAn increase in the rate of progressive income tax means that higher-income earners will pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. This reduces the gap in disposable income between high-income and low-income individuals. This policy is a key tool for governments to redistribute income, leading to a **more even** (or more equal) distribution of income.\n\nSimultaneously, increasing government spending on hospitals improves the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. Better healthcare, including shorter waiting times, improved treatments, and greater availability of medical staff and equipment, leads to better health outcomes for the population (e.g., higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality). Health is a critical non-material component of the standard of living. Therefore, an increase in spending on hospitals will cause **living standards to rise**.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: becomes less even, fall**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in the rate of progressive taxation is designed to make the distribution of income *more* even, not less even. Furthermore, increased expenditure on healthcare is a direct improvement to a key component of living standards, causing them to *rise*, not fall.\n\n**B: becomes less even, rise**\nThis is incorrect because while increased hospital spending does cause living standards to rise, an increase in the rate of progressive income tax makes the distribution of income *more* even, not less even. It narrows the gap between the disposable incomes of the rich and the poor.\n\n**C: becomes more even, fall**\nThis is incorrect because while an increased rate of progressive tax does make the income distribution more even, an increase in spending on hospitals will cause living standards to *rise*. While higher taxes reduce disposable income (a material aspect of living standards), the significant improvement in healthcare (a non-material aspect) is considered a net increase in the overall standard of living."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_415.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "25 the population pyramids for country 1 and country 2 in a given year are shown.\ncountry 1 country 2\n100+ 100+\nmale 95-99 female male 95-99 female\n90-94 90-94\n85-89 85-89\n80-84 80-84\n15-19 15-79\n70-74 70-74\n65-69 65-69\n60-64 60-64\n55-59 55-59\n50-54 50-54\n45-49 45-49\n40-44 40-44\n35-39 35-39\n30-34 30-34\n25-29 25-29\n20-24 20-24\n15-19 15-19\n10-14 10-14\n5-9 5-9\n0-4 0-4\n10 8 6 4 2 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 108 6 4 2 0 0 2 4 6 8 10\npercentage percentage\nwhat can be deduced from these population pyramids?\na country 1 has a greater population size than country 2.\nb country 1 has a higher life expectancy than country 2.\nc country 2 has a lower death rate than country 1.\nd country 2 spends more money on childcare than country 1.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nA population pyramid for a country with high life expectancy will show a significant percentage of the population in the older age groups. In the pyramid for Country 1, the bars for the age groups from 60 upwards are relatively large, indicating that a substantial proportion of the population survives into old age. Conversely, the pyramid for Country 2 narrows very quickly, with a very small percentage of the population in the older age groups. This indicates that people in Country 2, on average, do not live as long as people in Country 1. Therefore, it can be deduced that Country 1 has a higher life expectancy.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **A: Country 1 has a greater population size than country 2.**\n    This is incorrect. Population pyramids illustrate the age and gender structure of a population as a *percentage* of the total, not in absolute numbers. It is impossible to determine the total population size of either country from this data. Country 2 could have a much larger total population than Country 1, even though its pyramid shows a smaller percentage of older people.\n\n*   **C: Country 2 has a lower death rate than country 1.**\n    This is incorrect. A high death rate is represented by a pyramid that narrows rapidly with increasing age, as a large proportion of each age group does not survive to the next. The pyramid for Country 2 has a classic expansive shape with a wide base and very narrow top, which is characteristic of a high death rate and high birth rate. Country 1's pyramid is more rectangular, indicating a low death rate, as a larger proportion of people survive into older age. Therefore, Country 2 has a higher death rate than Country 1.\n\n*   **D: Country 2 spends more money on childcare than country 1.**\n    This is incorrect. While Country 2 has a larger proportion of young people (a wider base on the pyramid), which suggests a greater need for childcare, the pyramids provide no information about economic factors like public or private spending.

GDP per capita provides a measure of the average economic output or income per person in a country and is a more accurate indicator of living standards than total GDP. It is calculated by dividing the total GDP by the population.\n\nFor Country B:\n- GDP = $700 million\n- Population = 2 million\n- GDP per capita = $700,000,000 / 2,000,000 = $350\n\nThis figure is the highest among all four countries. A higher GDP per capita suggests a higher average standard of living, greater access to goods and services, and therefore a more developed economy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:**\nCountry A's GDP per capita is calculated as $600 million divided by 3 million people, which equals $200. This is significantly lower than Country B's GDP per capita of $350. A lower GDP per capita indicates a lower average income and standard of living, making it less developed than Country B.\n\n**C:**\nWhile Country C has a very large total GDP of $12,000 million, it also has a large population of 40 million. Its GDP per capita is $12,000 million divided by 40 million, which equals $300.

For this strategy to be beneficial, countries must be able to trade the goods they specialise in for the goods that other countries produce more efficiently.\n\nFree trade, which is the absence of trade barriers like tariffs and quotas, facilitates this exchange. It creates a global market where specialised producers can sell their output and consumers can access a wider variety of goods at lower prices. The ability to trade freely provides the essential incentive and mechanism for countries to specialise, as it ensures they can obtain the products they no longer produce themselves. Therefore, free trade is a primary driver that encourages international specialisation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. a foreign exchange shortage**\nA shortage of foreign exchange means a country lacks the necessary foreign currency (e.g., US dollars, Euros) to pay for its imports. This situation severely restricts a country's ability to trade internationally. Consequently, a country facing such a shortage would likely be forced to reduce its reliance on foreign goods and attempt to produce more for itself, a policy known as import substitution. This is the opposite of international specialisation, which relies on robust international trade.\n\n**B. diseconomies of scale**\nDiseconomies of scale occur when a firm or industry expands production to a point where long-run average costs begin to increase. This is often due to issues with management, coordination, and communication in very large organisations. The prospect of achieving *economies* of scale (falling average costs) can encourage specialisation and large-scale production. However, diseconomies of scale represent a negative outcome and a potential limit to the benefits of specialisation. They act as a disincentive, not an encouragement, to further specialise and increase output.\n\n**D. quotas**\nA quota is a government-imposed quantitative limit on the amount of a good that can be imported. Quotas are a form of trade protectionism designed to shield domestic industries from foreign competition by restricting the supply of imported goods. By limiting trade, quotas prevent countries from fully capitalising on their comparative advantages. They discourage specialisation because they interfere with the free flow of goods that makes specialisation mutually beneficial."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_418.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "28 a country wants to limit the number of imported cars to a maximum of 100000 in a year.\nwhich measure is most likely to achieve this objective?\na anembargo\nb  animport quota\nc_animport tariff\nda subsidy", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "### **Correct Answer: B**\n\nAn **import quota** is a government-imposed limit on the physical quantity of a specific good that can be imported into a country during a particular period. By setting an import quota at 100,000 cars per year, the government can directly ensure that the number of imported cars does not exceed this specific amount. This is a form of quantitative restriction, making it the most direct and effective tool for achieving a precise numerical limit on imports.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A: an embargo**\nAn embargo is a complete ban on trade with a particular country or on a specific product. If a country were to place an embargo on imported cars, it would mean that zero cars could be imported. This measure is far more restrictive than the stated objective, which is to allow a maximum of 100,000 cars, not to prohibit them entirely.\n\n**C: an import tariff**\nAn import tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. While a tariff increases the price of imported cars and would therefore reduce the quantity demanded, it does not guarantee a specific quantitative limit. The actual number of cars imported would depend on factors like the price elasticity of demand. The government can only estimate the effect of a certain tariff level on the quantity of imports; it cannot use it to set a firm and precise ceiling of 100,000 units.\n\n**D: a subsidy**\nA subsidy is a form of financial assistance paid by the government to a business or economic sector. If the government provided a subsidy to its domestic car manufacturers, it would lower their production costs, allowing them to sell their cars at a lower price. This would make domestic cars more competitive against imported cars, thereby reducing the demand for imports. However, like a tariff, this is an indirect measure. It does not place a direct limit on the number of imports and cannot guarantee that the number of imported cars will be exactly at or below the 100,000 target."}, {"questionName": "IG_eco_p1_419.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0455_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "29 the diagram shows a change in the exchange rate for the indian rupee against the us$.\nprice of ss,\nindian\nrupee __\\ s\ninusg pt .\npyprseommmnnt oy\ni; d\no qi q\nquantity of\nindian rupees\nwhat could cause the change in the exchange rate?\na adecrease in the rate of inflation in india\nb_anincrease in demand for imports by people in india\nc greater foreign direct investment into india\nd greater purchases of its own currency by the indian central bank", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "economics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: B**\n\nAn increase in the demand for imports by people in India means that Indian consumers and firms wish to buy more goods and services from other countries, such as the US. To pay for these imports, they must first purchase the foreign currency (e.g., US dollars). In the foreign exchange market, this is achieved by supplying their own currency, the Indian rupee, in exchange for the US dollar. This action increases the supply of Indian rupees on the market, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. With demand remaining constant, an increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price for the currency, resulting in a depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar.\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A:** A decrease in the rate of inflation in India, relative to its trading partners like the US, would make Indian exports cheaper and more competitive internationally. This would lead to an increase in foreign demand for Indian goods and, consequently, an increase in the demand for Indian rupees to pay for them. This increased demand would cause the rupee to appreciate (its price would rise), not depreciate.\n\n**C:** Greater foreign direct investment (FDI) into India involves foreign firms and investors buying Indian assets or setting up businesses in India. To make these investments, they must first convert their foreign currency into Indian rupees. This increases the demand for the Indian rupee on the foreign exchange market, which would cause its value to appreciate (rise), not depreciate.\n\n**D:** When the Indian central bank purchases its own currency in the foreign exchange market, it uses its reserves of foreign currencies (like the US dollar) to do so. This action directly increases the demand for the Indian rupee. Central banks typically undertake such an intervention to support their currency's value and prevent it from falling. Therefore, this would lead to an appreciation (a rise in price) of the rupee, which is the opposite of a depreciation."}]
