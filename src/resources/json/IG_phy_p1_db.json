Between these major markings, there are four smaller graduations, creating five intervals. Therefore, each small graduation represents an increment of 25 cm\u00b3 \u00f7 5 = 5 cm\u00b3. The initial reading shows the water level (meniscus) is exactly on the line marked 125 cm\u00b3. So, the initial volume is 125 cm\u00b3.\n\n2.  **Determine the final volume:** After pouring some water out, the final reading shows the meniscus on the first graduation below the 75 cm\u00b3 mark. This corresponds to a volume of 75 cm\u00b3 - 5 cm\u00b3 = 70 cm\u00b3. So, the final volume is 70 cm\u00b3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the difference:** The volume of water poured out is the initial volume minus the final volume.\n    Volume poured = 125 cm\u00b3 - 70 cm\u00b3 = 55 cm\u00b3.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 51 cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. The initial volume is 125 cm\u00b3. If 51 cm\u00b3 of water were poured out, the final volume would be 125 cm\u00b3 - 51 cm\u00b3 = 74 cm\u00b3. The scale shows the final volume is exactly on the 70 cm\u00b3 mark, not at 74 cm\u00b3, which would be just below the 75 cm\u00b3 line.\n\n**B: 52 cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. The initial volume is 125 cm\u00b3. If 52 cm\u00b3 of water were poured out, the final volume would be 125 cm\u00b3 - 52 cm\u00b3 = 73 cm\u00b3. The diagram shows the final water level on a specific graduation mark (70 cm\u00b3), not between marks as 73 cm\u00b3 would be.\n\n**D: 63 cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. The initial volume is 125 cm\u00b3. If 63 cm\u00b3 of water were poured out, the final volume would be 125 cm\u00b3 - 63 cm\u00b3 = 62 cm\u00b3. The final volume reading is 70 cm\u00b3. A volume of 62 cm\u00b3 would be slightly above the 60 cm\u00b3 graduation, which does not match the diagram."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_2.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 the diagram shows the speed-\u2014time graph for a car.\nspeed y\nx\n0\n0 time\n\nwhich row describes the motion of the car at point x and at point y?\npat int\n\na at rest moving with constant speed\n\nb moving with constant speed at rest\n\ncc moving with changing speed at rest\n\nd moving with changing speed moving with constant speed", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nA speed-time graph illustrates an object's speed as a function of time. The gradient (or slope) of the line at any point represents the object's acceleration, which is the rate of change of speed.\n\n*   **At point X:** The graph is a straight, sloped line. A non-zero gradient indicates that there is acceleration. Since acceleration is a change in speed per unit time, the car's speed is changing at this point. Specifically, the positive gradient shows that the car is speeding up (accelerating).\n\n*   **At point Y:** The graph is a horizontal line. A horizontal line has a gradient of zero, which signifies zero acceleration. Zero acceleration means the speed is no longer changing. Since the line is above the time axis (speed > 0), the car is moving at a constant speed.\n\nTherefore, the car is moving with a changing speed at point X and moving with a constant speed at point Y.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect because at point X, the car is not at rest. For the car to be at rest, its speed would have to be zero, which would be represented by a point on the horizontal time axis. At point X, the speed is clearly greater than zero.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for both points. At point X, the speed is changing due to acceleration, as shown by the sloped line. Constant speed is represented by a horizontal line. At point Y, the car is not at rest; it is moving at a constant, non-zero speed, as indicated by the horizontal line being above the time axis.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because at point Y, the car is not at rest. A state of rest implies a speed of zero. The horizontal line at point Y corresponds to a constant, positive speed, meaning the car is in motion.

This is because the change in height (in this case, from 4.0 m down to 1.0 m) is insignificant when compared to the total radius of the planet (Mars has a radius of about 3,390 km). The strength of the gravitational field does not change noticeably over such a small distance.\n\nThe problem states that the acceleration of the ball at a height of 2.0 m is 3.8 m/s\u00b2. Since the acceleration due to gravity is constant near the surface, the acceleration will be the same at any point during its short fall. Therefore, the acceleration at a height of 1.0 m is also 3.8 m/s\u00b2. The information that the ball is in a vacuum confirms that air resistance can be ignored, so the only acceleration acting on the ball is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 1.9 m/s\u00b2**\nThis option incorrectly assumes that gravitational acceleration is directly proportional to the height above the surface. Halving the height from 2.0 m to 1.0 m does not halve the acceleration. Gravitational acceleration is nearly uniform for objects close to a planet's surface.\n\n**C: 5.7 m/s\u00b2**\nThis value does not follow from any correct physical principle. It appears to be an arbitrary distractor. The acceleration of a freely falling object near a planet's surface remains constant, it does not increase by a factor of 1.5 over a distance of one metre.\n\n**D: 7.6 m/s\u00b2**\nThis option incorrectly suggests that the acceleration doubles. This may confuse the concepts of velocity and acceleration. While the velocity of the ball increases as it falls, the acceleration due to gravity remains constant. The gravitational force, and thus the acceleration, does not double over this small change in height."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_4.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "4 two objects are placed on a balance, one on each side, as shown.\nwhich properties of the objects can be compared using the balance?\na_ weight, mass and volume\nb_ weight and mass only\nc_ volume and density\nd_ density only", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the correct answer: B\n\nA balance operates on the principle of moments. It compares the turning effect (torque) produced by the force of gravity (weight) on an object on one side of a pivot (fulcrum) with that of another object on the other side. When the beam is horizontal and stationary, it indicates that the clockwise and anticlockwise moments are equal. As the pans are at equal distances from the fulcrum, this means the weights of the two objects must be equal.\n\nWeight (W) is directly proportional to mass (m) through the equation W = mg, where g is the constant gravitational field strength. Since the gravitational field strength is the same for both objects on the balance, if their weights are equal, their masses must also be equal. Therefore, a balance is a device used to compare both the weights and the masses of objects.\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n**A: weight, mass and volume**\nWhile a balance is used to compare weight and mass, it provides no information about an object's volume. Volume is the amount of three-dimensional space an object occupies. Two objects with the same mass, and therefore the same weight, can have vastly different volumes. For instance, a kilogram of lead has a much smaller volume than a kilogram of wood. As the balance cannot measure or compare the space the objects occupy, it cannot be used to compare their volumes.\n\n**C: volume and density**\nA balance cannot be used to compare either volume or density. Volume is the measure of the space an object occupies, which a balance does not measure. Density is a derived physical property defined as mass per unit volume (\u03c1 = m/V). Although a balance can be used to compare mass, it gives no information about volume. Since a comparison of density requires information about both mass and volume, a balance alone is insufficient for this purpose.\n\n**D: density only**\nA balance is fundamentally designed to compare mass by balancing weights, not to compare density. Density is an intrinsic property of a substance, defined as its mass per unit volume. To compare the densities of two objects, one would need to know both their masses and their volumes. A balance only provides a comparison of their masses (and weights). Without any information about the objects' volumes, it is impossible to make a comparison of their densities."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_5.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5  arectangular swimming pool is 50m long and 25 m wide.\nit contains water at a depth of 2m.\nthe density of the water is 1000kg/m*.\nwhat is the mass of the water in the pool?\na 2.5kg b  2500kg c 77000kg d 2500000kg", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "***\n\n### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\nThe mass of an object is related to its density and volume by the formula:\n**Mass = Density \u00d7 Volume**\n\nFirst, the volume of the water in the rectangular swimming pool must be calculated.

The correct relationship is Mass = Density \u00d7 Volume. This error arises from a misunderstanding or incorrect rearrangement of the density formula.\n\n**B: 2500 kg**\nThis value is numerically equal to the volume of the water (2500 m\u00b3). This error occurs if the volume is calculated correctly, but the final step of multiplying by the density of water (1000 kg/m\u00b3) is omitted. It incorrectly equates volume in cubic metres with mass in kilograms.\n\n**C: 77 000 kg**\nThis result is obtained by incorrectly calculating the volume. Instead of multiplying the dimensions, they are added together (50 + 25 + 2 = 77), and this sum is then multiplied by the density (77 \u00d7 1000 kg/m\u00b3 = 77,000 kg).

This state is known as dynamic equilibrium. For the forces to be in equilibrium, the total upward force must be equal in magnitude to the total downward force.\n\n1.  **Direction of Forces:**\n    *   The weight (W) of an object always acts vertically downwards.\n    *   The upward force (U), or upthrust, acts vertically upwards.\n    *   The drag force (D) is a form of fluid resistance that always opposes the direction of motion. Since the object is rising, the drag force must act vertically downwards.\n\n2.  **Magnitude of Forces:**\n    *   For the net force to be zero, the sum of the upward forces must equal the sum of the downward forces.\n    *   Total Upward Force = U\n    *   Total Downward Force = W + D\n    *   Therefore, for equilibrium: **U = W + D**\n\nIn diagram D, the forces are correctly represented: U is upward, while W and D are downward. Checking the magnitudes:\n*   U = 3.0 N\n*   W + D = 2.0 N + 1.0 N = 3.0 N\nSince the total upward force (3.0 N) equals the total downward force (3.0 N), the net force is zero, which is consistent with the object rising at a constant speed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because the direction of the drag force (D) is wrong. The drag force is a resistive force that opposes motion. Since the object is rising (moving upwards), the drag force must act in the opposite direction, which is downwards. In this diagram, the drag force is shown acting upwards, which is physically incorrect for a rising object. Although the magnitudes of the forces shown would result in equilibrium (Upward forces = D + U = 1.0 N + 2.0 N = 3.0 N; Downward force = W = 3.0 N), the incorrect direction for the drag force makes this option invalid.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect for two reasons:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Direction of Drag Force:** The drag force (D) opposes motion. As the object is rising, the drag force must act downwards. This diagram incorrectly shows the drag force acting upwards.\n2.  **Unbalanced Forces:** For an object to move at a constant speed, the net force must be zero (Newton's First Law). In this diagram, the total upward force is U + D = 3.0 N + 2.0 N = 5.0 N, while the downward force is W = 1.0 N. The upward force is greater than the downward force, resulting in a net upward force of 4.0 N. A net force would cause the object to accelerate, which contradicts the condition of moving at a constant speed.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile the directions of all the forces in this diagram are physically correct (upward force U is up; weight W and drag force D are down), the magnitudes of the forces do not result in equilibrium. According to Newton's First Law, an object moving at a constant speed must have a zero net force.\n\nIn this case:\n*   Total Upward Force = U = 2.0 N\n*   Total Downward Force = W + D = 3.0 N + 1.0 N = 4.0 N\n\nThe total downward force (4.0 N) is greater than the total upward force (2.0 N). This would result in a net downward force of 2.0 N, causing the object to decelerate while rising. This contradicts the information that the object is moving at a constant speed."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_7.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "7 which force produces heating during contact with a moving object?\na weight\nb friction\nc_ electrostatic force\nd magnetic force", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nFriction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. When an object moves while in contact with another surface, work must be done to overcome this frictional force. According to the law of conservation of energy, this work is converted into other forms of energy, predominantly thermal energy (heat). This transfer of energy increases the internal energy of the molecules at the surfaces of the objects, which is observed as a rise in temperature. A common example is the warming sensation felt when rubbing your hands together; the work done against friction is converted into heat.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. weight**\nWeight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. It is a non-contact force that acts on the object's mass, pulling it towards the center of a larger body like the Earth. While an object's weight can affect the magnitude of the frictional force when it is in contact with a surface (as friction is often proportional to the normal force), weight itself does not directly produce heat during motion. The generation of heat is a direct consequence of the work done against the frictional force, not the gravitational force of weight.\n\n**C. electrostatic force**\nThe electrostatic force is the force of attraction or repulsion between stationary objects that have an electric charge. It is a non-contact, or field, force. While electrostatic forces can cause objects to move, the force itself is not what produces heat during the mechanical rubbing or sliding of surfaces. Heating related to electricity, such as Joule heating, occurs when an electric current flows through a resistor, which is a different physical process from the one described.\n\n**D. magnetic force**\nThe magnetic force is a non-contact force exerted between magnets, or between a magnet and a moving electric charge or current. Like the electrostatic force, it can cause motion but is not the direct cause of heating during the physical contact of a moving object. Although changing magnetic fields can induce currents that cause heating (eddy currents), this is a distinct phenomenon from the heat generated by mechanical friction between two surfaces."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_8.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "8 a metre rule is balanced at its midpoint.\nit remains balanced when a 3.0n load is hung from the 40cm mark and a second load is hung\nfrom the 80cm mark.\nwhat is the weight of the second load?\na 1.0n b 1.5n c 3.0n d 9.0n", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: A\n\nThe principle of moments states that for an object to be in rotational equilibrium (i.e., balanced), the sum of the clockwise moments about a pivot must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot. A moment is the product of a force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force (Moment = Force \u00d7 Distance).\n\n1.  **Identify the pivot:** A metre rule is 100 cm long. It is balanced at its midpoint, so the pivot (or fulcrum) is at the 50 cm mark.\n\n2.  **Calculate the anticlockwise moment:** A load of 3.0 N is hung at the 40 cm mark. This position is to the left of the pivot and creates an anticlockwise turning effect.\n    *   The perpendicular distance from the pivot is: 50 cm \u2013 40 cm = 10 cm.\n    *   The anticlockwise moment is: 3.0 N \u00d7 10 cm = 30 N\u00b7cm.\n\n3.  **Calculate the clockwise moment:** A second, unknown load (let's call its weight *W*) is hung at the 80 cm mark.

If the second load were 1.5 N, the clockwise moment it creates would be 1.5 N \u00d7 (80 cm \u2013 50 cm) = 1.5 N \u00d7 30 cm = 45 N\u00b7cm. This is not equal to the anticlockwise moment of 30 N\u00b7cm. With a greater clockwise moment, the metre rule would tilt downwards on the right side.\n\n**C. 3.0 N**\nThis option is incorrect. It mistakenly assumes that the forces must be equal for the system to be balanced. However, the principle of moments requires the *moments* (Force \u00d7 Distance) to be equal, not the forces themselves. If the second load were 3.0 N, the clockwise moment would be 3.0 N \u00d7 30 cm = 90 N\u00b7cm, which is much larger than the anticlockwise moment of 30 N\u00b7cm.

This is significantly larger than the anticlockwise moment of 30 N\u00b7cm, and the rule would not be balanced.

The volume of the block is 4.0 cm \u00d7 5.0 cm \u00d7 9.0 cm = 180 cm\u00b3. Dividing the weight by the volume gives 16 N / 180 cm\u00b3 \u2248 0.089 N/cm\u00b3.

The problem states that a fixed mass of gas is trapped inside the cylinder, meaning the mass (m) of the gas remains constant. When the piston is moved towards the open end, the volume (V) occupied by the gas increases. Since the constant mass is now spread out over a larger volume, the density of the gas decreases.\n\n*   **Pressure:** The pressure of a gas is caused by the collisions of its particles with the walls of the container. The problem states that the temperature remains constant, which means the average kinetic energy and speed of the gas particles do not change. According to Boyle's Law, for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume (P \u221d 1/V). As the piston moves outwards, the volume of the gas increases. This increased volume means the particles are more spread out and will collide with the container walls less frequently, leading to a decrease in pressure.\n\nTherefore, both the density and the pressure of the gas decrease.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: decreases, unchanged**\nWhile it is correct that the density decreases (as the constant mass of gas occupies a larger volume), it is incorrect that the pressure remains unchanged. For a fixed mass of gas, pressure and volume are intrinsically linked. According to Boyle's Law, at a constant temperature, if the volume changes, the pressure must also change in inverse proportion. An increase in volume causes a decrease in pressure.\n\n**C: increases, decreases**\nWhile it is correct that the pressure decreases, it is incorrect that the density increases. Density is mass divided by volume. Moving the piston outwards increases the volume available to the constant mass of gas. An increase in volume results in a decrease, not an increase, in density.\n\n**D: increases, unchanged**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts.

According to the kinetic theory of matter, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the constituent particles. When air is heated, it absorbs thermal energy, which is converted into kinetic energy of the air particles (molecules). As the kinetic energy of the particles increases, their average speed also increases. Therefore, the particles move more quickly in random directions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. The particles move more slowly.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Moving more slowly corresponds to a decrease in the kinetic energy of the particles. This would happen if the air were cooled, meaning thermal energy was removed from it, resulting in a lower temperature. Heating has the opposite effect.\n\n**C. The particles move closer together.**\nThis statement is incorrect. When air particles gain kinetic energy and move more quickly, they collide with each other and the walls of their container more frequently and with greater force. This increased motion causes the particles to spread further apart, a phenomenon known as thermal expansion. Consequently, the volume occupied by the gas increases (at constant pressure), and the density decreases. Particles move closer together during cooling and compression.\n\n**D.

The mass of the liquid increases, making the liquid less dense.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the mass of the liquid does not change with temperature. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance. Heating a liquid increases the kinetic energy of its particles but does not add more particles, so the mass remains constant. The liquid does become less dense, but this is a result of its volume increasing, not its mass.\n\n**B.

The process begins when a part of the fluid is heated, causing its particles to gain kinetic energy and move further apart. This expansion leads to a decrease in the fluid's density. Due to buoyancy, this less dense, warmer fluid rises, while the cooler, denser fluid from above sinks to take its place. This cooler fluid is then heated, and the cycle repeats, creating a continuous circulation known as a convection current. This movement of the fluid itself transfers thermal energy from one region to another. Since this mechanism relies on the free movement of particles, it can only occur in states of matter where particles are not fixed in position, namely liquids and gases.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**A. in gases, liquids and solids**\nThis option is incorrect because convection cannot occur in solids. In a solid, particles are held in fixed positions within a rigid lattice structure. They can only vibrate about these fixed points and are not free to move from place to place. The bulk movement of matter, which is essential for creating convection currents, is therefore impossible in solids. Thermal energy transfer in solids primarily occurs through conduction.\n\n**C. in gases and solids only**\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes liquids and incorrectly includes solids. While convection does occur in gases, it also occurs in liquids as they are also fluids with freely moving particles. As explained previously, convection does not occur in solids because their particles are locked into a fixed structure and cannot create the bulk flow required for a convection current.\n\n**D. in liquids only**\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes gases. Gases are also fluids, and the mechanism of convection applies to them just as it does to liquids. When a gas is heated, it expands, becomes less dense, and rises, allowing cooler, denser gas to sink. This creates convection currents that transfer heat, such as the circulation of air in a room heated by a radiator.

Using an average value of 336 m/s (which is within this range) for calculation with the given wavelength of 0.024 m:\n\n**f = 336 m/s / 0.024 m = 14,000 Hz**\n\nNext, we must determine if this frequency is audible to humans. The typical range of human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since 14,000 Hz falls within this range, the sound is audible.\n\nTherefore, the frequency is 14,000 Hz and it is audible to humans.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (A)\n\nThis option is incorrect because the stated frequency is wrong. The frequency (f) is calculated by dividing the speed of sound (v) by the wavelength (\u03bb). Using a typical value for the speed of sound in air (e.g., 336 m/s):\n\n**f = 336 m/s / 0.024 m = 14,000 Hz**\n\nThe value of 140 Hz is significantly lower than the correctly calculated frequency. A frequency of 140 Hz would correspond to a much longer wavelength of 2.4 m.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (B)\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the frequency of 140 Hz is incorrect. As calculated using the wave equation (f = v / \u03bb), the frequency for a sound wave with a wavelength of 0.024 m is 14,000 Hz, not 140 Hz.\n\nSecondly, the statement about audibility is inconsistent. The normal range for human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A frequency of 140 Hz is within this range and would be audible, contrary to the claim that it is not.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer (D)\n\nThis option correctly identifies the frequency but incorrectly assesses its audibility. The calculation using the wave speed equation (f = v / \u03bb) gives a frequency of 14,000 Hz for a sound wave with a wavelength of 0.024 m.\n\nHowever, the statement that this sound is not audible is incorrect. The accepted range for human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A frequency of 14,000 Hz is well within this range and is therefore audible to a person with normal hearing. Sound that is not audible to humans is either infrasound (below 20 Hz) or ultrasound (above 20,000 Hz)."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_24.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "24 the diagram shows a bar magnet at rest on a smooth horizontal surface. a length of soft-iron\nwire is held parallel to the magnet.\nn\n| comer wire\nmagnet\nss\nthe wire is released.\nwhat happens?\na_ the wire moves away from the magnet.\nb_ the wire moves towards the magnet.\nc_ the wire\u2019s centre stays in its present position and the wire rotates through 90\u00b0 in a clockwise\ndirection.\nd_ the wire\u2019s centre stays in its present position and the wire rotates through 90\u00b0 in an\nanticlockwise direction.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the correct answer: B\n\nA soft-iron wire is a ferromagnetic material, which means it can be easily magnetised. When the soft-iron wire is placed in the magnetic field of the permanent bar magnet, it becomes an induced magnet. The end of the wire nearer the North pole of the bar magnet will have a South pole induced on it, and the end nearer the South pole of the bar magnet will have a North pole induced.\n\nAccording to the law of magnetic poles, unlike poles attract. Therefore, the induced South pole on the wire is attracted to the magnet's North pole, and the induced North pole on the wire is attracted to the magnet's South pole. This results in a net attractive force acting on the entire wire, pulling it directly towards the magnet. Consequently, when released, the wire will accelerate and move towards the magnet.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n*   **A. The wire moves away from the magnet.**\n    This is incorrect. Magnetic induction in a ferromagnetic material like soft iron always results in a net attractive force. Repulsion only occurs between two like poles (e.g., North-North or South-South). Since the wire is initially unmagnetised, it will always be attracted to the magnet, not repelled by it.\n\n*   **C. The wire's centre stays in its present position and the wire rotates through 90\u00b0 in a clockwise direction.**\n    This is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, there is a net attractive force pulling the entire wire towards the magnet, so its centre will not remain stationary. Secondly, for the wire to rotate, a net torque (turning force) must act on it. Due to the symmetrical parallel arrangement, the attractive forces are distributed evenly along the length of the wire. These forces are directed towards the magnet and do not create a turning effect. Therefore, there is no net torque to cause rotation.\n\n*   **D. The wire's centre stays in its present position and the wire rotates through 90\u00b0 in an anticlockwise direction.**\n    This is incorrect for the same reasons as option C. A net attractive force will cause the wire's centre to move towards the magnet. Furthermore, the symmetrical nature of the forces means there is no net torque to cause rotation in any direction, including anticlockwise. The wire will only experience translation (movement towards the magnet), not rotation."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_25.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "25 aman walks across a carpet. he becomes negatively charged by friction with the carpet.\nwhat happens as he touches a metal object connected to the earth?\na the man gains electrons.\nb_ the man loses electrons.\nc_ the man gains protons.\nd_ the man loses protons.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: B\n\nAn object becomes negatively charged when it gains an excess of electrons. In this scenario, the friction between the man's shoes and the carpet causes electrons to transfer from the carpet to the man, resulting in the man having a net negative charge.\n\nThe Earth is a vast electrical conductor that can be considered an infinite reservoir for electrons, effectively having zero electrical potential. When the negatively charged man touches a metal object connected to the Earth, he provides a conducting path for the excess electrons to flow.\n\nSince like charges repel, the excess electrons on the man are repelled by each other. They will move from an area of high electron concentration (the man) to an area of low electron concentration (the Earth) until the charge is neutralized. This flow of charge is what is sometimes felt as a small electric shock. Therefore, the man loses electrons to the Earth to become electrically neutral.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options:\n\n*   **A: The man gains electrons.** This is incorrect.

This relationship is described by the formula R = \u03c1L/A, where R is resistance, \u03c1 (rho) is the resistivity of the material, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\n1.  **Effect of Length:** Resistance (R) is directly proportional to the length (L) of the wire. This means that a shorter wire will have less resistance, while a longer wire will have more resistance. To achieve a resistance less than the standard wire, a shorter length is required.\n2.  **Effect of Diameter/Area:** Resistance (R) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire. A larger cross-sectional area provides more pathways for the electric current, thus reducing resistance. Since the cross-sectional area is proportional to the square of the diameter (A \u221d d\u00b2), a wire with a larger diameter will have a larger area and consequently, a lower resistance.\n\nTo guarantee that a wire has a resistance less than the standard wire, both factors must contribute to decreasing the resistance.

This combination ensures the resistance is definitively lower.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. longer wire length, larger wire diameter**\nA longer wire increases resistance, while a larger diameter decreases resistance. Because these two factors have opposing effects, the overall change in resistance is not certain.

Therefore, this wire does not *definitely* have a lower resistance.\n\n**B. longer wire length, smaller wire diameter**\nA longer wire increases resistance. A smaller diameter (and thus smaller cross-sectional area) also increases resistance.

The power source shown is a direct current (DC) supply, indicated by the fixed positive (+) and negative (-) terminals.

The circuit contains a thermistor connected in series with a bulb. A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance is dependent on temperature. For the type of thermistor commonly used (NTC or Negative Temperature Coefficient), its resistance decreases as the temperature increases.\n\n1.  **Effect on Thermistor:** When the temperature of the thermistor increases, its electrical resistance decreases.\n2.  **Effect on Total Resistance:** Since the thermistor and the bulb are in series, the total resistance of the circuit is the sum of their individual resistances. A decrease in the thermistor's resistance leads to a decrease in the total circuit resistance.\n3.  **Effect on Current:** According to Ohm's Law (Current = Voltage / Resistance), a decrease in the total resistance of the circuit, with the voltage from the power supply remaining constant, will cause the current flowing through the circuit to increase.\n4.  **Effect on Bulb Brightness:** The brightness of the bulb depends on the electrical power it dissipates, which is given by the formula P = I\u00b2R, where I is the current and R is the bulb's resistance.

A thermistor's resistance changes with temperature, while an LDR's resistance changes with light intensity. Therefore, changing the light intensity will have no effect on the thermistor's resistance or the current in the circuit, and thus will not change the brightness of the bulb.\n\n**B: a decrease in temperature**\n\nThis option is incorrect. A decrease in the temperature of a standard (NTC) thermistor causes its resistance to increase. This increase in the thermistor's resistance will increase the total resistance of the series circuit. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), an increase in total resistance will cause the current flowing through the circuit to decrease.

Therefore, a current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field that forms concentric circles around the wire.

Consequently, the force on the compass needle will be in the opposite direction, causing it to deflect in the opposite direction from its initial deflection.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The deflection of the compass is caused by the magnetic field that exists in the space *around* the wire, not just *inside* it. While there is a magnetic field inside the conductor, it is the external field that interacts with the compass.

This effect describes the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor (the coil) when placed in a magnetic field. The magnitude of this turning force, or torque, determines the rotational speed of the motor.\n\nThe torque is directly proportional to three main factors:\n1.  The strength of the magnetic field (produced by the magnets).\n2.  The magnitude of the current flowing through the coil.\n3.  The number of turns of wire on the coil.\n\nThe problem states that the strength of the magnets has decreased. This reduction in magnetic field strength will lead to a smaller turning force, causing the motor to slow down. To compensate for this and maintain the original speed, the turning force must be restored to its original value. This can be achieved by increasing one or both of the other factors.\n\n-   **Increasing the current in the coil:** A larger current results in a stronger magnetic interaction, thereby increasing the turning force on the coil.\n-   **Increasing the number of turns on the coil:** More turns of wire mean that a greater length of the conductor is interacting with the magnetic field, which multiplies the force and increases the overall torque.\n\nTherefore, increasing both the current and the number of turns on the coil are effective ways to counteract the weaker magnets and keep the motor running at its original speed.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. decrease current, decrease number of turns**\nTo compensate for the weaker magnets, the turning force on the motor's coil must be increased.

Combining these two actions would significantly decrease the motor's speed, which is the opposite of the desired outcome.\n\n**B. decrease current, increase number of turns**\nThe goal is to increase the turning force to counteract the effect of the weaker magnets. While increasing the number of turns on the coil does increase the turning force, decreasing the current has the opposite effect. This action would reduce the turning force.

An ion is an atom that has gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge.\n\nThe problem states that lithium exists as positive ions. A positive ion, also known as a cation, is formed when a neutral atom loses one or more of its electrons.

A negative ion is formed when a neutral atom gains one or more electrons. The excess of electrons over protons gives the ion a net negative charge. Since lithium forms a positive ion, it must lose, not gain, electrons.\n\n**C: The nucleus of the ion has less charge.**\nThe charge of the nucleus is determined by the number of protons it contains. The process of forming an ion, called ionization, involves the loss or gain of electrons from the electron shells, which are outside the nucleus.

The nucleus of a lithium ion has the same positive charge as the nucleus of a lithium atom.\n\n**D: The nucleus of the ion is more positively charged.**\nSimilar to option C, this statement is incorrect because the charge of the nucleus is constant.

The time for the Moon to cycle through its phases (e.g., from new moon to new moon) is slightly longer, about 29.5 days (the synodic period), because the Earth is also moving in its orbit around the Sun.

By mass, the Sun is approximately 75% hydrogen. Hydrogen serves as the primary fuel for the nuclear fusion reactions that occur in the Sun's core. In this process, known as the proton-proton chain, hydrogen nuclei are fused together under immense temperature and pressure to form helium nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy as light and heat. Because hydrogen is the fuel for these reactions and the most abundant element, it accounts for the vast majority of the Sun's mass.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: carbon**\nWhile carbon is an essential element for life on Earth and is present in the Sun, it makes up a very small fraction of the Sun's mass (approximately 0.3%). In astronomy, elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are referred to as \"metals.\" Carbon is produced through nuclear fusion in stars, but this process occurs in stars that are more massive than the Sun or during later stages of a star's life cycle. Therefore, carbon does not account for most of the Sun's mass.\n\n**C: oxygen**\nSimilar to carbon, oxygen is present in the Sun but in small quantities, constituting about 0.8% of its mass. It is one of the most abundant \"metals\" in the Sun, but its mass is insignificant when compared to the mass of hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen and helium together make up about 99% of the Sun's mass, leaving very little for all other elements combined.\n\n**D: uranium**\nUranium is a very heavy element. Elements heavier than iron, including uranium, are not produced by nuclear fusion within stars like the Sun. Instead, they are formed during much more energetic cosmic events, such as supernova explosions or the merging of neutron stars.

Measure the time it takes to swing from P to Q to P 10 times and divide that time by 10.**\n\nThis method is the standard and most accurate procedure for determining the period of a pendulum for two key reasons:\n\n1.  **Correct Definition of a Period:** The period of oscillation (T) is defined as the time taken for one complete cycle of motion. For a pendulum starting at its extreme position P, a complete oscillation involves the bob swinging to the other extreme position Q and then returning to the starting point P. This path (P \u2192 Q \u2192 P) constitutes one full oscillation.\n\n2.  **Minimisation of Random Errors:** Measuring the time for a single, short event like one oscillation is highly susceptible to random errors, particularly human reaction time in starting and stopping the stopwatch. By measuring the total time (t) for a larger number of oscillations (n, in this case, 10), the uncertainty from the reaction time becomes a much smaller fraction of the total measured time. Calculating the average period by dividing the total time by the number of oscillations (T = t/n) significantly reduces the impact of these errors, leading to a more accurate and reliable result.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Measure the time it takes to swing from P to Q.**\n\nThis method is incorrect because the movement from one extreme position (P) to the other (Q) represents only half of a complete oscillation. The time measured would be half the period (T/2), not the full period. Furthermore, measuring the time for just a single half-swing is prone to significant inaccuracies due to reaction time error.\n\n**C. Measure the time it takes to swing from P to Q to P 10 times and multiply that time by 10.**\n\nThis method correctly identifies a complete oscillation (P to Q to P) and the good practice of timing multiple oscillations to improve accuracy. However, the final mathematical step is incorrect. To find the average time for one oscillation (the period), the total time measured for 10 oscillations must be divided by 10, not multiplied. Multiplying would result in a value 100 times larger than the actual period.\n\n**D. Measure the time it takes to swing from Q to P.**\n\nSimilar to option A, this method is incorrect because the movement from one extreme position (Q) to the other (P) is only half of a complete oscillation.

Average speed (`v`) is a scalar quantity defined as the total distance traveled (`s`) divided by the total time elapsed (`t`). This relationship shows that speed is directly proportional to the distance covered and inversely proportional to the time taken. The standard units for speed, such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h), are derived from this formula (distance/time).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. `v = s \u00d7 t`**\n\nThis equation is incorrect because it suggests that speed is the product of distance and time. This contradicts the physical concept of speed. For example, if an object takes a longer time (`t`) to travel a fixed distance (`s`), its speed (`v`) must decrease, not increase as this formula implies. Furthermore, a dimensional analysis shows this formula is invalid; multiplying distance (unit: meters, m) by time (unit: seconds, s) gives units of m\u00b7s, which is not a unit of speed.\n\n**C. `v = t / s`**\n\nThis equation represents the reciprocal of speed, not speed itself. It calculates the time taken to travel a unit of distance (with units like s/m), which is a measure of slowness. The correct definition of speed is the distance covered per unit of time. According to this incorrect formula, traveling a greater distance (`s`) in the same amount of time (`t`) would result in a lower speed (`v`), which is contrary to the physical definition of speed.\n\n**D. `v = s \u00d7 t\u00b2`**\n\nThis equation is dimensionally and conceptually incorrect for calculating average speed. Terms involving time squared (`t\u00b2`) are found in the equations of motion for objects undergoing constant acceleration (for example, in the displacement formula `s = ut + \u00bdat\u00b2`), but they do not define average speed.

Thus, the air resistance is 20 000 N downwards.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B: 20 000 N upwards**\nThis option has the correct magnitude but the incorrect direction. Air resistance is a type of drag force that always acts in the opposite direction to the object's motion. As the rocket is travelling upwards, the air resistance must act downwards. If the air resistance were acting upwards, it would add to the thrust, resulting in a large net upward force. This would cause the rocket to accelerate upwards, contradicting the condition that it is travelling at a constant speed.\n\n**C: 180 000 N downwards**\nThis option has the incorrect magnitude. The value of 180 000 N is obtained by adding the thrust and the weight (100 000 N + 80 000 N). This is incorrect because thrust and weight are forces that act in opposite directions. For the rocket to travel at a constant speed, the upward and downward forces must be equal. The correct approach is to equate the total upward force (thrust) to the total downward force (weight + air resistance) and solve for the air resistance.\n\n**D: 180 000 N upwards**\nThis option is incorrect in both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of 180 000 N is the sum of thrust and weight, which is not the correct way to calculate the air resistance in this scenario. Furthermore, the direction is incorrect.

When the object is at rest, the net torque (or turning moment) about the pivot point, O, must be zero.\n\nIf the centre of gravity is vertically below the pivot point O, the line of action of the weight passes directly through the pivot.

This configuration corresponds to the lowest gravitational potential energy and is therefore the stable equilibrium position that the object will naturally settle into after swinging.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A & B: horizontally to the left of O / horizontally to the right of O**\nIf the centre of gravity were located horizontally to the left or right of the pivot point O, the force of gravity (weight) would act downwards at a horizontal distance from the pivot. This would create a non-zero torque (moment) about the pivot, causing the object to rotate. The object would continue to swing until its centre of gravity is positioned vertically below the pivot, where the torque becomes zero. Therefore, the object cannot be at rest in these positions.\n\n**C: vertically above O**\nWhile having the centre of gravity vertically above the pivot point O is a position of equilibrium (the torque is zero because the line of action of the weight passes through the pivot), it is an *unstable* equilibrium. Any slight displacement from this position would lower the centre of gravity, creating a torque that would cause the object to swing away from this position and not return. The object would eventually settle in the stable equilibrium position with its centre of gravity vertically below the pivot. Since the problem states the object comes to rest after swinging, it must be in its stable equilibrium state."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_46.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "6 three situations are listed.\n1 someone blowing air into a party balloon\n2 acrane lifting a block of concrete\n3 apile of books at rest on a shelf\nin which situations is work being done?\na 1,2and3 b jiand2only c_  1only d 2and 3 only", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**B. 1 and 2 only**\n\nIn physics, work is done when a force causes an object to undergo a displacement in the direction of the force. The formula for work done is *Work = Force \u00d7 distance*. For work to be done, two conditions must be met: a force must be applied, and there must be movement (displacement).\n\n1.  **Someone blowing air into a party balloon:** When a person blows air into a balloon, their lungs exert a force to push the air. This force, acting as pressure inside the balloon, pushes against the inner surface of the balloon, causing the elastic material to stretch and expand. This expansion is a displacement. Since a force is causing a displacement, work is being done.\n\n2.  **A crane lifting a block of concrete:** The crane exerts an upward force on the block of concrete to overcome the force of gravity. As the crane lifts the block, the block moves upward. This upward movement is a displacement in the same direction as the applied force. Therefore, the crane is doing work on the block of concrete.\n\n3.  **A pile of books at rest on a shelf:** The shelf exerts an upward force on the books, which balances the downward force of gravity (the weight of the books). However, the books are described as being \"at rest,\" which means their displacement is zero. Since the distance moved is zero, no work is done on the books, even though forces are acting on them.\n\nBased on this analysis, work is being done in situations 1 and 2, but not in situation 3.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 1, 2 and 3**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes situation 3. In situation 3, a pile of books is at rest on a shelf. According to the definition of work in physics (*Work = Force \u00d7 distance*), work is only done if there is a displacement. Although the shelf exerts an upward force on the books, the books are stationary and do not move. With zero displacement, no work is done.\n\n**C. 1 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes situation 2, in which work is clearly being done. When a crane lifts a block of concrete, it applies an upward force that causes the block to move upward. Since there is both a force and a displacement in the direction of the force, work is being done by the crane on the block.\n\n**D. 2 and 3 only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes situation 1 and includes situation 3. In situation 1, blowing into a balloon causes it to expand, which is a displacement caused by a force, so work is done. In situation 3, the books on the shelf are at rest, meaning they have zero displacement.

This increases their kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and further apart from one another. The increased average separation between the particles results in the liquid occupying a larger space. This phenomenon is known as thermal expansion. Consequently, the **volume** of the liquid mercury **increases**.\n\nMass is a fundamental property of matter, representing the amount of substance present. The law of conservation of mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in any physical or chemical change.

An increase in the store of internal energy occurs when energy is transferred to the substance, either increasing its temperature (raising the average kinetic energy of its particles) or changing its state to one with higher potential energy (e.g., melting or boiling).\n\nHeating water from 25\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C directly increases its temperature. A higher temperature signifies that the average kinetic energy of the water molecules has increased. As a result, the total internal energy of the water increases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: water at 0\u00b0C freezing to form ice\nFreezing is a phase change from liquid to solid. During this process, the substance must release energy to its surroundings in the form of latent heat of fusion. As the water molecules arrange themselves into a more ordered crystal structure (ice), their potential energy decreases. Since the temperature remains constant at 0\u00b0C during freezing, the kinetic energy of the molecules does not change, but the decrease in potential energy results in an overall decrease in the store of internal energy.\n\n#### C: steam condensing on a window\nCondensation is a phase change from gas to liquid. For steam (gaseous water) to condense into liquid water, it must release a significant amount of energy, known as the latent heat of vaporization, to the cooler surface of the window. This release of energy corresponds to a decrease in the potential energy of the water molecules as they form closer bonds in the liquid state. Therefore, the internal energy of the water decreases during condensation.\n\n#### D: water in a puddle on a breezy day\nThis situation describes evaporation, a process where liquid water turns into water vapour. For evaporation to occur, the most energetic molecules at the water's surface must gain enough energy to escape the liquid phase. This energy is taken from the remaining liquid water, which causes the temperature of the puddle to decrease. A decrease in temperature means a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the remaining water molecules, leading to a decrease in the internal energy of the water in the puddle.

Within a liquid, particles are in constant, random motion and possess a range of kinetic energies.

These energetic particles then escape from the surface, transitioning into a gas. This process is why evaporation is known as a surface phenomenon.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. Particles become fixed in position.**\nThis statement describes the process of freezing or solidification, where a liquid turns into a solid. In the solid state, particles are arranged in a fixed, often crystalline, structure and can only vibrate about their fixed positions. Evaporation is a transition from liquid to gas, which involves an increase in particle energy and freedom of movement, not a decrease.\n\n**C. Particles move much closer together.**\nThis statement describes the process of condensation (gas to liquid) or freezing (liquid to solid).

In evaporation, the opposite occurs: particles gain enough energy to overcome these forces and move much farther apart as they transition into the gaseous state.\n\n**D. Particles start to move around at random.**\nThis statement is incorrect because particles in a liquid are already moving around at random, constantly sliding past one another.

The Sun heats the Earth's surface, which in turn warms the air directly above it. This heated air expands, becomes less dense than the surrounding cooler air, and consequently rises. This upward movement of warm air is known as a thermal up-draught or a convection current. Cooler, denser air sinks to take its place, creating a continuous cycle that transfers heat through the atmosphere.\n\n**C. flames and smoke rising from a fire**\nThis phenomenon is driven by **convection**. The fire heats the surrounding air and the particles of smoke. These hot gases and smoke particles are much less dense than the cooler ambient air. Due to this density difference, the hot, buoyant mixture rises, carrying thermal energy upward. This movement of a heated fluid (the mixture of hot air and smoke) is a form of convection.\n\n**D. warming up water in a kettle on a gas ring**\nHeating water in a kettle is a primary example of **convection**. The heat source at the bottom of the kettle warms the water in direct contact with it. This water expands, its density decreases, and it rises.

The observation that the hand near side Y feels warmer indicates that it is receiving thermal energy at a higher rate. Since the hands are at an equal distance from the cube, this difference in heat felt must be due to a difference in the rate of thermal radiation emitted from the surfaces.\n\nBecause side Y is radiating heat more effectively, it must be the better emitter. Therefore, side Y is the black surface, and the rate of thermal emission from side Y is greater than that from side X, which must be the white surface.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect. If side X were the black side, it would be a better emitter of thermal radiation than the white side Y. Consequently, the hand held near side X would feel warmer, which contradicts the experimental observation.\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, the observation implies that side Y, not side X, is the black side. Secondly, the rate of emission of thermal radiation is dependent on the surface colour.

For this to happen, two specific conditions must be met:\n\n1.  **The light must be travelling from a more optically dense medium to a less optically dense medium.** Glass has a higher refractive index than air, meaning it is more optically dense. Therefore, light must travel from glass to air, not the other way around.\n2.  **The angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle.** The critical angle is the specific angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. If the angle of incidence exceeds this value, the light ray cannot refract into the less dense medium and is instead completely reflected internally.\n\nThis statement correctly identifies both of these necessary conditions.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. Total internal reflection occurs when light is incident on a glass to air boundary at an angle of incidence less than the critical angle.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes the condition for refraction, not total internal reflection. When light travels from a more optically dense medium (glass) to a less optically dense medium (air) at an angle of incidence *less than* the critical angle, the light will pass through the boundary and refract (bend) away from the normal into the air. Some partial reflection occurs, but it is not total internal reflection.\n\n**C. Total internal reflection occurs when light is incident on an air to glass boundary at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it violates the first condition for total internal reflection. Light is described as travelling from a less optically dense medium (air) to a more optically dense medium (glass). In this situation, the light ray always refracts *towards* the normal. The angle of refraction will always be smaller than the angle of incidence, so it can never reach 90 degrees. Therefore, total internal reflection is impossible when light travels from air to glass, regardless of the angle of incidence.\n\n**D. Total internal reflection occurs when light is incident on an air to glass boundary at an angle of incidence less than the critical angle.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for the same reason as C. Total internal reflection cannot occur when light travels from a less optically dense medium (air) to a more optically dense medium (glass).

This occurs because the refractive index of the medium (in this case, glass) is dependent on the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe visible spectrum of light, in order of increasing wavelength, is Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red (VIBGYOR). A useful mnemonic is ROYGBIV, which lists the colours in order of decreasing wavelength.\n\nA key principle of refraction and dispersion is that light with a **shorter wavelength refracts (bends) more**, while light with a **longer wavelength refracts less**. Therefore, the order of colours from least refracted to most refracted is Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\n\n*   **Refracts more than green:** Following the order of refraction, colours that bend more than green are Blue, Indigo, and Violet.

Due to their very short wavelength and high frequency, they are highly penetrating and ionising. This ionising ability means they can knock electrons out of atoms and molecules. When gamma rays pass through biological material, such as the bacteria and viruses on medical equipment, they cause significant damage to essential cellular components, particularly DNA. This damage disrupts the microorganisms' ability to reproduce and carry out vital functions, leading to their death and thus sterilising the equipment. This method, known as gamma irradiation, is particularly useful for sterilising heat-sensitive items like plastic syringes and catheters after they have been sealed in their packaging.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. microwaves:**\nMicrowaves are a form of non-ionising radiation. Their primary effect on materials is thermal; they cause water and other polar molecules to vibrate, which generates heat. While the heat produced by microwaves can kill microorganisms, this method is not typically used for sterilising medical equipment because the heating can be uneven, potentially leaving some areas unsterilised. Furthermore, microwaves cannot be used on metal instruments, as they would cause electrical arcing and damage the equipment.\n\n**C. radio waves:**\nRadio waves have the longest wavelengths and the lowest energy in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are non-ionising and do not have sufficient energy to damage the DNA of microorganisms or to generate the heat required for sterilisation. Their primary applications are in broadcasting and communications, and they are not used for sterilisation purposes.\n\n**D. visible light:**\nVisible light is also a form of non-ionising radiation. Its energy is too low to cause the molecular damage necessary to kill microorganisms effectively. While a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet (UV) light, can be used for surface sterilisation, visible light itself does not have significant germicidal properties. Additionally, its low penetrating power means it cannot sterilise objects that are packaged or have complex shapes with areas not directly exposed to the light."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_61.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "21 which process causes a sound wave to produce an echo?\na diffraction\nb_ dispersion\nc_ reflection\nd refraction", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nAn echo is a sound that is heard after the original sound has ceased, caused by the reflection of sound waves from a hard surface. Reflection is the process where a wave bounces off a boundary between two media, returning into the medium from which it originated. When a sound wave travels and strikes a distant, large, and hard surface, such as a cliff, building, or wall, it is reflected. If the distance to the surface is great enough, the reflected sound wave will return to the listener with a perceptible delay after the original sound was heard. This delayed, reflected sound is what we perceive as an echo.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. diffraction:**\nDiffraction is the phenomenon where waves bend or spread out as they pass through an aperture (an opening) or around an obstacle. This process explains why it is possible to hear a sound even when the source is not in the direct line of sight, for example, hearing someone talking from around a corner. Diffraction involves the bending of a wave's path, not its bouncing back from a surface. Therefore, it does not produce an echo.\n\n**B. dispersion:**\nDispersion is the process by which a wave is separated into its constituent frequencies. This is most commonly observed with light, where a prism separates white light into a spectrum of colours because the refractive index of the glass is different for each frequency (colour) of light. While sound is composed of various frequencies, dispersion of sound in air is generally negligible and is not the mechanism that creates an echo. An echo is a reflection of the entire sound wave, not its separation into different frequencies.\n\n**D. refraction:**\nRefraction is the change in the direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another, or through a medium where the speed of the wave changes. This bending occurs because the wave's speed is different in the new medium or region. For sound, refraction can happen when it travels through air layers of different temperatures, which can cause the sound to bend upwards or downwards. Refraction describes the bending of a wave as it continues to propagate, not its bouncing back towards the source, and therefore is not the cause of an echo."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_62.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_m24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "22 astudent stands 75m from a wall and makes a short, loud sound by tapping two pieces of wood\ntogether.\nwhat is the approximate time between making the sound and the student hearing the echo\nproduced?\na 0.2s b 05s c 2s d 5s", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nAn echo is the reflection of a sound wave that is heard after the original sound.

The time for the sound to travel just one way to the wall is approximately 75 m / 340 m/s \u2248 0.22 s. For the echo to be heard, the sound must complete a round trip. A time of 0.2 s is not even sufficient for the sound to reach the wall, let alone return.\n\n**C) 2 s:** This time is too long. For the sound to take 2 seconds to travel the 150 m round trip, its speed would have to be: Speed = 150 m / 2 s = 75 m/s. This is far too slow for the speed of sound in air, which is approximately 340 m/s.\n\n**D) 5 s:** This time is significantly too long. For the sound to take 5 seconds to travel the 150 m round trip, its speed would have to be: Speed = 150 m / 5 s = 30 m/s. This speed is incorrect for sound travelling through air.

A magnetic material attracts another magnetic material if one of them is magnetised.**\n\nThis statement is always true due to the principle of magnetic induction. A **magnetic material** (such as iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt) is a substance that can be magnetised. When a permanent magnet (a magnetised magnetic material) is brought close to an unmagnetised piece of magnetic material, the magnet induces magnetism in the unmagnetised material.\n\nThe pole induced in the part of the material closer to the magnet is always of the opposite polarity. For example, if the north pole of a magnet is brought near an iron nail, the end of the nail closer to the magnet becomes a south pole. Since opposite poles attract, there will always be a force of attraction between the magnet and the unmagnetised magnetic material. This interaction is always attractive, regardless of which pole of the magnet is used.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. A magnetic material attracts a non-magnetic material.**\n\nThis statement is false. A magnetic material that is magnetised (i.e., a magnet) only exerts a significant force of attraction on other magnetic materials. **Non-magnetic materials**, such as wood, plastic, glass, or copper, are not affected by a magnetic field and are not attracted to a magnet.\n\n**B. A magnetic material repels another magnetic material.**\n\nThis statement is not always true. Repulsion only occurs under a specific condition: when two magnetised materials (two magnets) are brought together with their like poles facing each other (North-North or South-South). However, if unlike poles are brought together (North-South), they will attract. Furthermore, a magnetised material will always attract an unmagnetised magnetic material. Since attraction is also a possible outcome, it is incorrect to state that repulsion always occurs. In fact, repulsion is the only definitive test to prove that two objects are both magnets.\n\n**D. A non-magnetic material repels another non-magnetic material.**\n\nThis statement is false. Non-magnetic materials do not possess the properties required to create a magnetic field.

The rod gains electrons.**\n\nAn object's overall electric charge is determined by the balance between its protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge). In a neutral object, the number of protons and electrons is equal. Charging by friction involves the transfer of electrons between two materials when they are rubbed together. For an object to become negatively charged, it must have an excess of electrons. Therefore, when the polythene rod is rubbed, it gains electrons from the other material (e.g., a woolen cloth). This results in the rod having more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. The rod loses electrons.**\n\nIf the rod were to lose electrons, it would be left with more protons than electrons. Since protons are positively charged, a deficit of electrons would result in the rod having a net positive charge. This contradicts the information given in the question, which states that the rod becomes negatively charged.\n\n**C. The rod gains protons.**\n\nProtons are located in the nucleus of an atom and are tightly bound. They are not transferred between materials during the process of charging by friction. Charging of insulators is solely due to the transfer of mobile outer-shell electrons. Furthermore, if an object were to gain protons, which are positively charged particles, it would become positively charged, not negatively charged.\n\n**D. The rod loses protons.**\n\nSimilar to the reasoning for option C, protons are fixed within the atomic nucleus and cannot be removed by simple friction. The energy required to remove protons from a nucleus is immense and only occurs in nuclear reactions, not in electrostatic charging.

This is given as 0.30 A. Ammeter 3 is also placed in the main part of the circuit, after the parallel branches have recombined.

However, the value for the current in ammeter 3 (0.00 A) is incorrect. Ammeter 3 measures the total current returning to the battery. A reading of 0.00 A would imply an open circuit or that no charge is returning to the source, which violates the principle of a complete electrical circuit.

It consists of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core, which forms an electromagnet. When a small current flows through this coil, it generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field attracts a movable iron armature, causing it to pivot and operate a set of switch contacts in a separate, often high-power, circuit. By using a small current to create a magnetic force, a relay can safely control a much larger current. This is a direct and practical application of the magnetic effect of an electric current.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. heater**\nAn electric heater operates on the **heating effect** of an electric current, not the magnetic effect. When current passes through a conductor with high resistance, such as the heating element in a heater, electrical energy is converted into thermal energy due to collisions between the moving electrons and the atoms of the conductor.

The primary purpose and principle of a heater is to generate heat, which is a thermal effect, not a magnetic one.\n\n**B. lamp**\nA conventional incandescent lamp works primarily on the **heating effect** of an electric current. A current is passed through a thin, high-resistance filament (usually made of tungsten). This heats the filament to a very high temperature, causing it to glow and produce light (incandescence). While a current in the filament does produce a very weak magnetic field, this field is an incidental byproduct and is not used in the lamp's operation to produce light. Therefore, the functioning of a lamp is based on the heating effect, not the magnetic effect.\n\n**D. thermistor**\nA thermistor is a resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature.

This is not the specified output voltage of 60 V.\n\n**D: 800**\nThis value is incorrect and results from a common conceptual error. This answer is obtained by incorrectly inverting the voltage ratio in the transformer equation, i.e., calculating N\u209b = N\u209a \u00d7 (V\u209a / V\u209b) = 200 \u00d7 (240 V / 60 V) = 200 \u00d7 4 = 800. The transformer described is a step-down transformer because the output voltage (60 V) is less than the input voltage (240 V). A step-down transformer must have fewer turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil (N\u209b < N\u209a).

An atom has positive charge because there are only positive charges in the nucleus.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, an atom is electrically neutral, not positively charged. An atom that has lost electrons and has a net positive charge is called a positive ion or cation. Secondly, the nucleus contains both positively charged protons and uncharged (neutral) neutrons. Therefore, it is not composed of *only* positive charges.\n\n**B. An atom has negative charge because there are only negative charges in the nucleus.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. An atom is electrically neutral. Furthermore, the nucleus of an atom is positively charged due to the presence of protons.

A 'source' in this context is a specific sample of radioactive material used for experiments. Including a source would result in measuring the combined radiation from the source and the background, not the background radiation alone.

The counter is a recording device that tallies electrical pulses. It cannot directly detect ionising radiation. The detector is the essential component that interacts with the radiation and sends a signal to the counter.

Gamma radiation is the emission of a high-energy photon from an excited nucleus. This process releases excess energy but does not alter the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus. Therefore, the element remains the same after gamma emission.\n\n*   **C: beta or neutron**\n    While beta decay does change the element, neutron emission does not. Neutron emission is the ejection of a neutron from the nucleus. This decreases the mass number but does not change the number of protons (the atomic number). The resulting nucleus is an isotope of the original element, not a different element.\n\n*   **D: gamma or neutron**\n    Neither gamma decay nor neutron emission changes the atomic number of a nucleus.

It reduces the amount of radiation that can escape from the box.**\n\nRadioactive sources emit ionising radiation (such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays), which can be harmful to living organisms. To handle and store these sources safely, they must be kept in containers that can block or significantly reduce this radiation. This practice is known as shielding. Lead is a very dense material with a high atomic number, which makes it highly effective at absorbing radiation, particularly the highly penetrating gamma rays. The lead lining acts as a shield, absorbing the energy of the radiation and preventing most of it from passing through the walls of the box. This protects people and the environment from exposure.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It helps the source to stay radioactive for longer.**\n\nThe rate at which a radioactive source decays is an intrinsic property of the specific radioactive isotope, determined by its half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the unstable nuclei in a sample to decay. This rate is not affected by external physical or chemical conditions, such as the material of its container. Therefore, a lead lining does not alter the decay rate or make the source remain radioactive for a longer or shorter period.\n\n**B. It makes the box heavier.**\n\nWhile it is true that lining the box with lead makes it heavier due to lead's high density, this is a consequence of using lead, not the primary reason for its use in this application. The primary purpose of the lead lining is for radiation safety. The added weight is an incidental, and sometimes inconvenient, side effect of using a dense material for shielding.\n\n**C. It makes the radioactive source more stable.**\n\nThe stability of a radioactive nucleus is an inherent characteristic. An unstable nucleus will decay spontaneously to become more stable. Making a source \"more stable\" would imply slowing down its rate of decay. The lead lining is external to the radioactive source and does not interact with the nuclei in a way that would alter their fundamental stability or their rate of decay.

The time interval must be the time elapsed *between* points X and Y (20 s), not the total time from the start of the motion.\n\n**C. 0.40 m/s**\nThis answer is incorrect. It represents the average speed for the entire journey from the start (0 s, 0 m) to point Y (30 s, 12 m). The calculation is: Total distance / Total time = 12 m / 30 s = 0.40 m/s.

This value only describes the motion during the first 10 seconds, not the motion between 10 s and 30 s.

Since the rocket's mass (m) is constant, and the value of g is smaller on the Moon, the resulting weight of the rocket on the Moon will be less than its weight on the Earth.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: mass on the Moon (less than on the Earth), weight on the Moon (same as on the Earth)**\n\nThis option is incorrect because both statements contradict fundamental physics principles. The mass of an object is constant and does not depend on its location. The weight of an object is dependent on the local gravitational field strength; since gravity is weaker on the Moon, the weight cannot be the same as on Earth.\n\n**B: mass on the Moon (less than on the Earth), weight on the Moon (more than on the Earth)**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The mass of the rocket is an unchangeable property, so it cannot be less on the Moon.

The force it measures in this context is the gravitational force acting on the mass in the dish, which is the definition of weight. The reading on the spring balance is directly proportional to the total weight hanging from its hook. Since the same dish is used for both the rice and the pasta, the weight of the dish is a constant factor in both measurements. For the final reading on the balance to be the same in both cases, the weight of the rice must be equal to the weight of the pasta.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. density**\n\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume (\u03c1 = m/V). Rice and pasta are different substances with different compositions and structures, so they are very unlikely to have the same density. Since the spring balance shows they have the same weight, they must also have the same mass (as weight = mass \u00d7 gravitational field strength). If two different substances have the same mass, they will only have the same density if they also have the same volume, which is not a necessary condition. The quantity that is directly measured and found to be equal is weight, not density.\n\n**B. temperature**\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. A spring balance does not measure temperature; it measures force (weight). The weight of an object is independent of its temperature (within normal conditions). The rice and the pasta could be at different temperatures and still have the same weight. Therefore, their temperatures do not have to be the same.\n\n**C. volume**\n\nVolume is the amount of space an object occupies. Since the rice and pasta have the same weight, they also have the same mass. However, because rice and pasta are different materials with different densities, equal masses of each will almost certainly occupy different volumes. For example, pasta is generally less dense than rice, so a given mass of pasta would occupy a larger volume than the same mass of rice.

Constant velocity means that both the speed and the direction of motion are constant. Moving at a constant speed in a straight line perfectly describes motion at a constant velocity. Since the velocity is not changing, the acceleration is zero.

Deceleration is a form of acceleration (a change in velocity). According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), a non-zero acceleration requires a non-zero resultant force. In this case, the resultant force acts in the opposite direction to the object's motion, causing it to slow down.\n\n**B. the object moving at an increasing speed**\n\nAn object with an increasing speed is accelerating. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), if an object is accelerating, there must be a non-zero resultant force acting on it. This resultant force acts in the same direction as the object's motion, causing it to speed up.\n\n**C. the object moving at a constant speed in a circle**\n\nVelocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (speed) and direction. For an object moving in a circle, even at a constant speed, its direction is continuously changing. A change in direction is a change in velocity, which means the object is accelerating. This is known as centripetal acceleration. According to Newton's Second Law (F = ma), this acceleration requires a resultant force, called the centripetal force, which acts towards the center of the circle.

This is because for the object to be in rotational equilibrium, the net torque must be zero. The two main forces acting on the plate are the upward tension at the pivot point (P) and the downward force of gravity (weight) acting through the centre of gravity. If the centre of gravity were not vertically below the pivot, the force of gravity would create a turning moment (torque) that would cause the object to rotate until the centre of gravity is positioned as low as possible, which is directly beneath the pivot.\n\nIn this setup, we know that the centre of gravity lies somewhere along the vertical line that passes through P and Q. However, this single suspension is not enough to pinpoint the exact location of the centre of gravity on that line. To find the precise position, one must suspend the plate from a second, different point. A new vertical line would be drawn from this second pivot point. The centre of gravity is the unique point where these two lines intersect. Since only one suspension is shown, further investigation is necessary.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is at P.**\nThis is incorrect. The point P is the pivot point from which the plate is suspended. For the plate to be in stable equilibrium, its centre of gravity must be at the lowest possible position, which is vertically below the pivot point. If the centre of gravity were at the pivot point P, the object would be in neutral equilibrium, but this is not the stable state an object settles into, and it is not the general case for an irregular lamina.\n\n**B. It is at Q.**\nThis is incorrect. Point Q is simply a point on the edge of the plate that happens to be vertically below the pivot point P. While the centre of gravity does lie on the vertical line that passes through both P and Q, there is no physical principle that dictates it must be located at the edge of the plate. The position of the centre of gravity depends on the distribution of mass throughout the entire plate, and it is typically located within the body of the object, not on its boundary.\n\n**C. It is halfway between P and Q.**\nThis is incorrect. The position of the centre of gravity depends on the specific shape and mass distribution of the plate. For a uniformly dense, regular shape like a rectangle suspended from a corner, the centre of gravity would be at its geometric centre, which is not necessarily halfway along the vertical line from the suspension point. For an irregularly shaped plate, there is no reason to assume that the mass is distributed so symmetrically that the centre of gravity would be exactly at the midpoint of the line segment PQ.

Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object stores due to its vertical position in a gravitational field. The formula for GPE is GPE = mgh, where 'm' is the mass, 'g' is the gravitational field strength, and 'h' is the vertical height. When water is pumped up to a higher altitude, its height 'h' increases. Consequently, its gravitational potential energy store must also increase. This principle is used in pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations to store energy.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. water pumped up to a high-altitude dam | kinetic energy of water | decreases**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. While the water is moving as it is being pumped, the primary energy change associated with raising its position is in its gravitational potential energy. The main purpose of pumping water to a high-altitude dam is to store potential energy, not to change its kinetic energy. In fact, if the water starts at rest in a lower reservoir and ends at rest in the upper reservoir, the net change in its kinetic energy is zero. The energy from the pump is converted into GPE. Therefore, focusing on kinetic energy and stating it decreases is an incorrect description of the principal energy transformation.\n\n**C. air passes through a wind turbine | gravitational potential energy of air | increases**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Wind turbines are designed to extract energy from the motion of the air (wind), which is a store of kinetic energy. Gravitational potential energy relates to the height of the air. As air passes more or less horizontally through the blades of a wind turbine, its height does not significantly change. Therefore, gravitational potential energy is not the relevant energy store in this process.\n\n**D. air passes through a wind turbine | kinetic energy of air | increases**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A wind turbine works by converting the kinetic energy of the moving air into the rotational energy of the blades, which then drives a generator. For energy to be transferred from the air to the turbine, the air must do work on the blades. As a result of doing this work, the air loses energy. This loss of energy manifests as a decrease in the air's speed after it passes through the turbine. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the speed (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2), a decrease in speed means the kinetic energy of the air decreases."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_91.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "11. arock of weight 50n falls a vertical distance of 7.0m from rest.\nwhat is the change in the gravitational potential energy store of the rock?\na decrease of 7.1j\nb_ decrease of 350 j\nc_ increase of 7.1j\nd_ increase of 350j", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe change in the gravitational potential energy (GPE) store is calculated using the formula:\n\u0394E_p = mgh\nwhere \u0394E_p is the change in potential energy, m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the change in vertical height.\n\nThe weight (W) of an object is given by the formula W = mg.

Gravitational potential energy is directly proportional to the height of an object above a reference point. As the height decreases, the gravitational potential energy must also decrease. This energy is converted into kinetic energy as the rock gains speed.\n\nTherefore, the change in the gravitational potential energy store of the rock is a decrease of 350 J.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: decrease of 7.1 J**\nThis value is incorrect. The magnitude of the change in gravitational potential energy is found by multiplying the weight by the vertical distance fallen (50 N \u00d7 7.0 m), not by dividing or using another incorrect operation. The correct calculation yields 350 J.\n\n**C: increase of 7.1 J**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the magnitude of the energy change is calculated incorrectly; it should be 350 J. Secondly, the direction of the change is wrong. As an object falls, its height decreases, causing its gravitational potential energy to decrease, not increase.\n\n**D: increase of 350 J**\nWhile the magnitude of the energy change (350 J) is calculated correctly, the direction of change is incorrect. Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored due to an object's position in a gravitational field.

This means that to achieve the greatest power, the work must be completed in the shortest amount of time. Of the times given, 10 s is the shortest, and therefore corresponds to the greatest useful power output.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B) 20 s**\nFor a constant amount of work done, power is inversely proportional to the time taken. A time of 20 s is longer than 10 s. A longer time to perform the same amount of work (climbing the stairs) results in a lower rate of energy transfer, and thus a smaller power output compared to the run completed in 10 s.\n\n**C) 30 s**\nPower and time are inversely proportional when the work done is constant. A time of 30 s is longer than both 10 s and 20 s. This means the work is being done at an even slower rate. Therefore, the power generated during the 30 s run would be less than the power generated during the shorter runs, and it would not be the greatest.\n\n**D) 40 s**\nThe relationship Power = Work Done / Time indicates that for a fixed amount of work, the longest time will result in the smallest power. The time of 40 s is the longest of all the options. This corresponds to the slowest rate of doing work and therefore the lowest useful power output, not the greatest."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_93.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13. a woman has a weight of 600n. she stands on a horizontal floor. the area of her feet in contact\nwith the floor is 0.050 m?.\nwhat is the pressure she exerts on the floor?\na 1.2 10\u00b0n/m?\nb 2.4 10\u00b0n/m?\nc 1.2x10*n/m?\nd 2.4x 10*n/m?", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nPressure is defined as the force applied perpendicular to a surface per unit area over which the force is distributed.

As a result, they move rapidly and randomly, spreading out to fill any container they occupy. This leads to large average distances between individual particles, so they are described as being **far apart**.\n*   **Liquids:** Particles have less kinetic energy than in gases. The intermolecular forces are strong enough to hold the particles in close proximity, but not in fixed positions. The particles can slide past one another, allowing the liquid to flow. Because they are in contact, they are described as being **close together**.\n*   **Solids:** Particles have the lowest kinetic energy and are held in fixed positions by very strong intermolecular forces, typically in a regular arrangement called a lattice. They vibrate about these fixed points but cannot move freely. This tight packing means the particles are **close together**.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is: gas particles are far apart, while liquid and solid particles are close together.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n*   **Option A is incorrect** because it inaccurately describes particles in liquids and solids as being \"far apart\". Both liquids and solids are condensed states of matter where particles are held in close proximity by significant intermolecular forces. This close packing is why they have much higher densities than gases and are nearly incompressible.\n\n*   **Option B is incorrect** because it inaccurately describes particles in a liquid as being \"far apart\".

The particles in a liquid are close together, not widely separated as they are in a gas.\n\n*   **Option D is incorrect** because it reverses the descriptions for gases and solids.

The temperature of a liquid is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. During evaporation, it is the particles with the highest kinetic energy (the \"hottest\" particles) that have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction and escape from the surface of the liquid. When these high-energy particles leave, the average kinetic energy of the particles remaining in the liquid decreases. A lower average kinetic energy corresponds to a lower temperature, so the remaining liquid cools down. This phenomenon is known as evaporative cooling.\n\n2.  **\"During evaporation, the more energetic particles escape from the surface of the liquid.\"** This statement is **correct**. As explained above, evaporation is a process where individual particles transition from a liquid to a gaseous state.

Firstly, white surfaces are inherently poor absorbers of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared. They reflect most of the radiation that strikes them. Secondly, shiny or polished surfaces are very effective at reflecting radiation. The combination of a white colour and a shiny texture results in a surface that reflects the maximum amount of incident infrared radiation, and consequently absorbs the minimum amount.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A. dull black\nA dull black surface is the **best** absorber of infrared radiation, not the worst. Black surfaces are excellent absorbers of radiation, as they absorb energy across most wavelengths. Furthermore, a dull or matte texture, which is rough on a microscopic level, traps incident radiation, further increasing absorption. Therefore, a dull black surface has the highest absorptivity among the choices.\n\n#### B. dull white\nA dull white surface is a poor absorber of infrared radiation but not the worst. While the white colour makes it a good reflector, its dull texture reduces its ability to reflect radiation compared to a shiny surface. The rough, matte finish increases its surface area and traps some of the incident radiation, making it a better absorber than a shiny white surface.\n\n#### C. shiny black\nA shiny black surface is a relatively good absorber of infrared radiation, and certainly not the worst. The black colour makes the surface a good absorber of thermal energy. However, its shiny texture makes it a good reflector. These two properties are in opposition.

When white light enters the prism, it undergoes refraction. Because the refractive index of glass varies with the wavelength of light (a property called dispersion), each color within the white light is refracted by a slightly different amount.\n\n1.  **Dispersion at the First Surface:** As white light enters the prism, it splits into its constituent colors. Violet light, having the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum, has a higher refractive index in glass and is therefore refracted (bent) the most. Red light, with the longest wavelength, has a lower refractive index and is refracted the least. The diagram correctly shows this initial separation.\n2.  **Dispersion at the Second Surface:** As the separated colors exit the prism, they are refracted again. This second refraction increases the angular separation between the colors.\n3.  **Correct Order of Colors:** The diagram accurately shows that red light is deviated the least from its original path, while violet light is deviated the most. This results in red light appearing at the top and violet light at the bottom of the emergent spectrum.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** This diagram is incorrect because it fails to show dispersion at the first surface of the prism. Dispersion begins as soon as the white light enters the glass, not just when it exits. While it correctly shows that red light is deviated less than violet light at the second surface, the absence of initial dispersion makes the overall representation inaccurate.\n\n**C:** This diagram is incorrect because it shows the reverse of what happens during dispersion. It depicts red light being refracted more than violet light. In reality, violet light has a shorter wavelength and experiences a greater change in speed when entering glass, causing it to bend more than red light, which has a longer wavelength.\n\n**D:** This diagram contains two fundamental errors. Firstly, similar to diagram A, it incorrectly shows no dispersion occurring at the first surface where the white light enters the prism. Secondly, similar to diagram C, it incorrectly shows red light being deviated more than violet light upon exiting the prism.

Most common household remote controllers, such as those for televisions or air conditioners, use infrared (IR) radiation to transmit signals. Inside the remote, a light-emitting diode (LED) produces invisible pulses of IR light. These pulses are arranged in a specific binary pattern that represents a command, such as 'volume up' or 'power off'. A sensor on the receiving appliance detects these light pulses, decodes the pattern, and executes the corresponding function. Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic wave, with a wavelength slightly longer than that of visible red light. It is used because it is inexpensive to produce, reliable for short-range, line-of-sight communication, and harmless to humans.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: A remote controller emits microwave radiation.**\nMicrowave radiation is a type of electromagnetic wave used in applications like microwave ovens, radar, and wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. While some advanced \"smart\" remotes may use Bluetooth (which operates in the microwave frequency band) to communicate with devices, standard remote controllers do not use microwaves. The technology in a typical line-of-sight remote is based on the simpler and more cost-effective method of transmitting signals via infrared radiation.\n\n**C: A remote controller emits ultrasound.**\nUltrasound consists of sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper limit of human hearing (above 20 kHz). Unlike infrared radiation, which is an electromagnetic wave, ultrasound is a mechanical wave and requires a medium (like air) to travel. While some very early remote controls from the mid-20th century did use ultrasound, this technology was largely abandoned because it was unreliable and could be accidentally triggered by other high-frequency sounds, such as jingling keys. Modern remote controllers use infrared radiation, which is not susceptible to this type of interference.\n\n**D: A remote controller emits ultraviolet radiation.**\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible violet light. It has more energy per photon than visible light or infrared radiation. This higher energy makes UV radiation potentially harmful to human tissues, capable of causing damage to the skin and eyes with sufficient exposure.

The time it takes for the light from the smoke to travel 100 m is negligible. The problem statement confirms this by saying Student Y \"sees the smoke the instant it is produced.\" Therefore, the time to see the smoke can be taken as t_light \u2248 0 s.\n\n2.  **Time for Sound to Travel:** The sound travels at a much slower speed of 340 m/s.

A time delay of 0.59 s would be calculated if the distance were approximately 200 m (since 200 m / 340 m/s \u2248 0.59 s) or if the speed of sound were half the given value (100 m / 170 m/s \u2248 0.59 s). Neither of these conditions matches the information provided in the problem. This answer may result from a simple calculation error.\n\n**C: 1.7 s**\nThis value is incorrect.

For instance, dividing the speed of sound by the distance (340/100 = 3.4) and then halving the result gives 1.7. This is not the correct procedure. The correct formula is `Time = Distance / Speed`. Applying this formula correctly yields a result of approximately 0.29 s, not 1.7 s.\n\n**D: 3.4 s**\nThis answer is incorrect.

As the cloth loses negatively charged electrons, it is left with an excess of positive charges (protons) and therefore acquires a net positive charge.\n\nDiagram B correctly illustrates this process:\n1.  **Electron Movement:** The arrow shows electrons moving from the cloth to the rod. This transfer of electrons causes the rod to become negatively charged.\n2.  **Final Charge on the Cloth:** The cloth is shown with positive (+) signs, indicating it has become positively charged due to the loss of electrons.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** This diagram is incorrect because it shows electrons moving from the rod to the cloth. This would cause the rod to lose electrons and become positively charged, which contradicts the given information.\n\n**C:** This diagram is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it shows electrons moving from the rod to the cloth, which would make the rod positive. Secondly, it shows the cloth becoming negatively charged. When two neutral objects are charged by friction, they acquire opposite charges. If the rod became positive, the cloth would have to become negative (by gaining electrons), but the initial premise is that the rod becomes negative.\n\n**D:** This diagram correctly shows the direction of electron movement (from the cloth to the rod) that would make the rod negatively charged. However, it incorrectly shows the final charge on the cloth as negative.

In solid metallic conductors, such as a copper wire, the charge carriers are delocalised electrons.\n\nCopper atoms are arranged in a regular, fixed structure called a metallic lattice. In this structure, the outermost electrons of each copper atom are not tightly bound to their individual atoms. Instead, they become delocalised and form a 'sea' of free electrons that can move throughout the entire lattice. The copper atoms, having lost these electrons, become positive ions.\n\nWhen a potential difference (voltage) is applied across the ends of the copper wire, it creates an electric field. This field exerts a force on the free electrons, causing them to drift in a uniform direction towards the positive terminal. This directed movement of a vast number of free electrons constitutes the electric current in the wire.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: copper atoms**\nIn a solid metal like copper, the copper atoms (or more accurately, the positive copper ions) are held in fixed positions within the crystal lattice. While they vibrate about these fixed positions, they do not move through the wire to carry charge. The flow of entire atoms is characteristic of fluids (liquids or gases), not solid conductors.\n\n**C: protons from the copper nuclei**\nProtons are subatomic particles located within the nucleus of an atom. They are positively charged, but they are bound tightly within the nucleus by the strong nuclear force and are not free to move. The nuclei themselves are part of the fixed metallic lattice. Therefore, protons do not move through the wire and cannot contribute to the electric current.\n\n**D: neutrons from the copper nuclei**\nNeutrons, like protons, are located within the atomic nucleus and are not mobile. More importantly, neutrons have no electric charge (they are neutral). Since electric current is the flow of charge, the movement of uncharged particles like neutrons would not constitute an electric current."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_106.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "26 four students draw a circuit diagram of the apparatus used to measure the resistance of\nresistor r.\nwhich circuit is correct?\na b\nt+} h-|\nr r\ncc d\nr r", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Option\n\n**D is the correct circuit.** To measure the resistance of a component (R), it is necessary to measure the current (I) flowing through it and the potential difference (V) across it.\n*   An **ammeter**, which measures current, must be connected in **series** with the component.

An electric heater is a device specifically designed to convert electrical energy into thermal energy. This process is based on the principle of Joule heating, where the passage of an electric current through a resistor generates heat. The symbol itself is a modified version of the standard resistor symbol, often used to explicitly denote a component whose primary function is to produce heat.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A:** This symbol represents a **fixed resistor**. A fixed resistor is an electrical component with a specific, unchangeable electrical resistance. Its primary function in a circuit is to impede the flow of current, reduce voltage levels, or divide voltages. While any resistor generates heat when current flows through it, the main purpose of a component represented by this symbol is its defined resistance value, not the intentional generation of useful heat.\n\n**B:** This symbol represents a **fuse**. A fuse is a safety device containing a wire with a low melting point.

This requires closing all switches in that specific path. The path for the bell includes the main switch 1 and the switch in its branch, switch 3. Therefore, both switch 1 and switch 3 must be closed.\n\nFor the lamp *not* to light, the circuit path through it must be incomplete or broken. The path for the lamp includes the main switch 1 and the switch in its branch, switch 2. To prevent the lamp from lighting, switch 2 must remain open.\n\nAdditionally, switch 4 creates a path that bypasses both the bell and the lamp. If switch 4 were closed, it would create a short circuit \u2013 a path of very low resistance. The majority of the current would follow this path of least resistance, flowing through switch 4 and bypassing the bell. This would prevent the bell from ringing even if its path (through switch 3) were complete. Therefore, switch 4 must also remain open.\n\nConsequently, to make the bell ring without lighting the lamp, only switches 1 and 3 must be closed.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. 1 and 2 only:** Closing switches 1 and 2 completes the circuit through the lamp, causing it to light up. This violates the condition that the lamp should not be lit. Furthermore, with switch 3 open, the circuit through the bell is incomplete, so the bell will not ring.\n\n**C. 1, 3 and 4:** While closing switches 1 and 3 provides a path for the bell, also closing switch 4 creates a short circuit. A short circuit is a low-resistance path parallel to other components. Electric current preferentially flows through the path of least resistance. As a result, almost all the current from the battery would flow through switch 4, bypassing the bell. Insufficient current would flow through the bell to make it ring.\n\n**D. 2, 3 and 4:** Switch 1 is in series with the entire parallel arrangement of components. It acts as a master switch. If switch 1 is open, the entire circuit is broken at the source. No current can flow from the battery to any part of the circuit, regardless of the positions of the other switches.

Less energy is wasted.**\n\nThe primary purpose of transmitting electricity at a very high voltage is to increase efficiency by minimizing energy loss. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current (P = V \u00d7 I). Therefore, to transmit a certain amount of power, if the voltage is increased, the current required is proportionally decreased.\n\nAll transmission cables have some electrical resistance (R). As current (I) flows through these cables, energy is converted into heat and lost to the surroundings. The rate of this energy loss (power loss) is given by the formula P = I\u00b2R.\n\nSince the power loss is proportional to the square of the current, even a small reduction in current leads to a significant reduction in wasted energy. By stepping up the voltage to very high levels (e.g., hundreds of kilovolts) for long-distance transmission, the current is made very small. This drastically reduces the I\u00b2R heat loss in the cables, ensuring that most of the electrical energy generated at the power station reaches the consumers.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is faster.**\n\nThe speed of electrical energy transmission is determined by the speed of the electromagnetic waves that propagate along the transmission wires. This speed is approximately the speed of light and is not dependent on the voltage or current. Therefore, transmitting electricity at a high voltage does not make it travel any faster.\n\n**B. It is safer.**\n\nHigh voltage is extremely dangerous. A high potential difference can cause a large, lethal current to flow through any conducting path, including the human body. For this reason, high-voltage transmission lines are suspended high above the ground on pylons and are heavily insulated. The voltage must be significantly reduced (stepped down) by transformers at local substations before it can be safely distributed to homes and businesses. Therefore, high-voltage transmission is inherently less safe, not more so.\n\n**D. Less equipment is needed.**\n\nTransmitting electricity at high voltage requires more, not less, equipment. Power stations must use large step-up transformers to increase the voltage for transmission. Then, a network of substations with step-down transformers is required to decrease the voltage in stages to safe, usable levels for consumers.

This fits the definition of an isotope.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer: A\n\nIn the standard nuclide notation \u1d2cZX, the bottom number represents the atomic number (Z), which defines the element. The original element X has an atomic number Z = 26. The notation for option A is \u00b2\u2076\u2085\u2086X. In this notation, the atomic number Z is 56.

Radioactive decay is a random process, meaning it is impossible to predict which specific nucleus will decay next. However, the probability that any individual nucleus will decay in a set period (like ten minutes) is a fixed value, determined by the isotope's decay constant. All uranium-238 nuclei in the sample are identical and therefore share this same, constant probability of decay.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** The mode of decay is a specific characteristic of a radioactive isotope. Uranium-238 primarily undergoes alpha decay. The probability of it undergoing beta decay is effectively zero. Therefore, the probabilities of emitting an alpha particle, a beta particle, or a gamma ray are not equal. Each decay process has its own distinct probability.\n\n**B:** This statement is incorrect. While the overall activity (the total number of decays per second) of the sample decreases over time because there are fewer undecayed nuclei, the probability of decay for any *single, individual nucleus* remains constant. This constant probability is an intrinsic property of the uranium-238 isotope and does not change with time.\n\n**D:** This statement is incorrect for the same reason as option B. The probability of decay for an individual nucleus does not depend on its age. A uranium-238 nucleus that has existed for a billion years has the exact same probability of decaying in the next minute as a newly formed one.

From the table, the initial count rate at time t = 0 minutes is 480 counts/second.\n2.  To find the half-life, we need to determine the time at which the count rate becomes half of this initial value. Half of 480 is 480 / 2 = 240 counts/second.\n3.  Looking at the table, the count rate is 240 counts/second at a time of t = 60 minutes.\n4.  Therefore, the half-life of the isotope is 60 minutes.\n\nWe can verify this using another interval. At t = 20 minutes, the count rate is 380 counts/second. After one half-life (60 minutes), at t = 20 + 60 = 80 minutes, the count rate should be halved to 380 / 2 = 190 counts/second.

However, the data shows a count rate of 380 counts/second at 20 minutes. This is inconsistent, so this option is incorrect.\n\n**B) 40 minutes**\nIf the half-life were 40 minutes, the count rate should be halved after 40 minutes. The initial count rate is 480 counts/second, so the count rate at 40 minutes should be 480 / 2 = 240 counts/second. The table shows the count rate at 40 minutes is 300 counts/second. Since the measured value does not match the expected value, this option is incorrect.\n\n**D) 80 minutes**\nIf the half-life were 80 minutes, the count rate at 80 minutes should be half of the initial count rate.

The value '2' represents the acceleration of the car, not the distance travelled.

Mass is a force.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object and a measure of its inertia (its resistance to acceleration). It is a scalar quantity, and its SI unit is the kilogram (kg). A force, on the other hand, is a push or a pull that can cause an object with mass to accelerate. Force is a vector quantity, and its SI unit is the Newton (N). Mass and force are two distinct physical quantities.\n\n---\n### **A. Masses can be compared using a balance.**\nThis statement is correct. A beam balance operates by comparing the weights of two objects. When the balance is level, the gravitational force (weight) acting on the object on one pan is equal to the gravitational force acting on the known masses on the other pan. Since weight is directly proportional to mass (Weight = mass \u00d7 gravitational field strength, W = mg), if the weights are equal in the same location (where the gravitational field strength 'g' is constant), their masses must also be equal. Therefore, a balance is a standard instrument for comparing masses.\n\n### **C. Weights can be compared using a balance.**\nThis statement is correct. A balance, such as a beam balance, directly compares the gravitational forces, or weights, acting on the objects in its pans. The balance achieves equilibrium when the moment created by the weight on one side is equal to the moment created by the weight on the other side. This means the two weights are equal. Thus, a balance is an instrument used to compare weights.\n\n### **D. Weight is a force.**\nThis statement is correct. Weight is specifically defined as the force of gravity acting on an object's mass. It is calculated using the formula W = mg, where 'm' is mass and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity or gravitational field strength. Because it is a force, weight is a vector quantity (it has a direction, always pointing towards the centre of the massive object like a planet) and is measured in Newtons (N)."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_125.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 which two quantities must be known to determine the density of a material?\na mass and area\nb- mass and volume\nc_ weight and area\nd_ weight and volume", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nDensity is a fundamental physical property of a substance, defined as its mass per unit volume. The formula for density (\u03c1) is:\n\n\u03c1 = m / V\n\nwhere 'm' is the mass of the substance and 'V' is the volume it occupies. To calculate the density, one must know both of these quantities. Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object (typically measured in kilograms or grams), and volume is the amount of three-dimensional space the object occupies (typically measured in cubic metres or cubic centimetres). Therefore, knowing the mass and volume of a material is essential to determine its density.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. mass and area:**\nArea is a measure of a two-dimensional surface, not the three-dimensional space an object occupies. Density relates the amount of matter (mass) to the space it fills (volume). Dividing mass by area would calculate a quantity known as surface density or areal density, which is conceptually different from the standard (volume) density.\n\n**C. weight and area:**\nThis option involves two incorrect quantities for determining density. Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object (Weight = mass \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity), not its mass. Area is a two-dimensional measurement. The quantity calculated by dividing weight (a force) by area is pressure (Pressure = Force / Area), which is a completely different physical property from density.\n\n**D. weight and volume:**\nWhile weight is related to mass, they are distinct physical quantities. Weight is a force that depends on the local gravitational field, whereas mass is an intrinsic property of an object. The definition of density specifically requires mass, not weight. Although one could calculate mass from weight if the acceleration due to gravity (g) is known (mass = weight / g), this would require knowledge of a third quantity (g).

The formula is: **Moment = Force \u00d7 Perpendicular Distance**. In the context of a boy on a see-saw, the force causing the turning effect is the boy's weight, which acts downwards. The distance is the horizontal distance from the pivot to the point where the boy is sitting. Therefore, the moment created by each boy depends on two factors: his weight (the force) and his distance from the pivot.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A) his distance from the pivot only**\nThis statement is incorrect because a moment is the turning effect of a force. While the distance from the pivot is a critical component, there can be no moment without a force being applied. According to the formula (Moment = Force \u00d7 Distance), both a force and a distance are necessary to produce a moment. Distance alone does not create a turning effect.\n\n**B) his height above the ground and his weight**\nThis statement is incorrect because the height of the see-saw above the ground is not relevant to the calculation of the moment about the pivot. The moment depends on the perpendicular distance from the pivot *to the line of action of the force*. For a horizontal see-saw, this is the distance along the beam, not the vertical height from the ground. While weight is the correct force, the height above ground is an irrelevant quantity for this calculation.\n\n**C) his weight only**\nThis statement is incorrect because the turning effect of a force depends not only on its magnitude (the weight) but also on where it is applied relative to the pivot. A force applied far from the pivot has a greater turning effect (a larger moment) than the same force applied closer to the pivot. If a force is applied directly at the pivot (distance = 0), it produces no moment at all, regardless of its magnitude.

It may arise from neglecting both the weight of the beam and the principle of leverage, for instance, by incorrectly assuming the balancing force *F* must be equal to the load force of 8.0 N. In a lever system, the magnitude of the forces depends on their distances from the pivot.\n\n**B) 18 N**\nThis answer is incorrect. It is likely the result of a calculation error where the moment due to the beam's weight was subtracted from the moment due to the load, instead of being added to it. Both the 8.0 N load and the 4.0 N weight are on the same side of the pivot and act in the same direction, so their moments are additive. The calculation would have looked like this: (8.0 N \u00d7 50 cm) - (4.0 N \u00d7 10 cm) = 360 N cm, leading to *F* = 360 N cm / 20 cm = 18 N. This is conceptually wrong as both forces cause an anticlockwise turning effect.\n\n**D) 44 N**\nThis answer is incorrect. This value might be obtained by correctly calculating the total anticlockwise moment (440 N cm) but then making an error when calculating *F*. For example, incorrectly dividing the total anticlockwise moment by the distance of the beam's weight from the pivot (10 cm) instead of the distance of force *F* from the pivot (20 cm): 440 N cm / 10 cm = 44 N.

An object is in stable equilibrium if, when slightly displaced, it returns to its original position. This occurs when the object has the lowest possible centre of gravity. A lower centre of gravity means that more work must be done against gravity to tilt the object to the point where it topples.\n\n*   **Most Stable Toy:** Comparing the three toys, toy X has its centre of gravity at the lowest point, very close to its base of support. This configuration makes it the most stable. A large tilting angle is required before the vertical line through its centre of gravity falls outside its base, making it difficult to topple.\n\n*   **Least Stable Toy:** Conversely, an object is least stable when its centre of gravity is as high as possible. A higher centre of gravity means that only a small amount of tilting is needed to move the centre of gravity outside the base of support, causing it to topple easily. Toy Z has its centre of gravity in the highest position.

When the phone is operating, chemical reactions within the battery release this energy, causing an electric current to flow through the phone's internal circuits. The transfer of energy by an electric current is defined as electrical work being done. This electrical energy is then converted by the phone's components into other forms, such as the internal energy of the components (leading to heating) and the kinetic energy of the vibrating speaker diaphragm (leading to sound).

While a mobile phone does produce mechanical effects, such as the vibration of its speaker (a form of kinetic energy), this is a result of an electrical process. The initial transfer of energy from the battery's chemical store to the phone's circuits is not achieved by a mechanical force. Instead, electrical energy is supplied to the speaker, which then performs mechanical work to create vibrations.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nElectromagnetic waves, such as light from the screen and radio waves for communication, are indeed energy transfers associated with a mobile phone. However, these are typically outputs from the phone. The fundamental process of getting energy from the chemical store in the battery to power the components that produce these waves is not via electromagnetic radiation. That initial transfer is electrical.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nSound waves are a mechanism for transferring energy away from a source through a medium. In a mobile phone, sound is an output generated by the speaker. The speaker converts electrical energy into kinetic energy (vibrations), which then produces sound waves. The transfer of energy from the battery's chemical store to the speaker is electrical, not via sound waves.

In this problem, the force is the constant weight of the marble block, which is 125,000 N. The pressure exerted on the ground changes when the orientation of the block changes, as this alters the area of contact.\n\n1.  **Pressure in the first orientation (Diagram 1):** The block rests on its long side.

Therefore, the change is an increase of 100,000 N/m\u00b2.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. a decrease of 25 000 N/m\u00b2**\n\nThis is incorrect. The pressure *increases* when the block is moved from the first orientation to the second. This is because the area of contact with the ground decreases (from 5 m\u00b2 to 1 m\u00b2), and since pressure is inversely proportional to area, a smaller area results in a larger pressure. The value of 25,000 N/m\u00b2 is the initial pressure in the first orientation, not the change in pressure.\n\n**C. an increase of 125 000 N/m\u00b2**\n\nThis is incorrect. While the pressure does increase, the value of 125,000 N/m\u00b2 represents the final pressure exerted by the block in the second orientation. The question asks for the *change* in pressure, which is the difference between the final pressure (125,000 N/m\u00b2) and the initial pressure (25,000 N/m\u00b2), not just the final pressure value itself.\n\n**D. no change**\n\nThis is incorrect. The pressure exerted by an object on a surface depends on both the force (its weight) and the area of contact. While the weight of the block remains constant, the area of contact changes significantly when its orientation is changed. Because the area changes, the pressure must also change.

It is the point at which the particles of a substance have their minimum possible thermal energy. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system. As a substance is cooled, the kinetic energy of its constituent particles decreases. At absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15 \u00b0C), the particles theoretically have zero kinetic energy, meaning all classical motion ceases. Since it is not possible to remove any more thermal energy from the system, no lower temperature can be reached.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer B\n\nAccording to the particle model, particles in a solid are in a constant state of vibration about fixed positions. The amplitude of these vibrations is related to the temperature of the solid. At absolute zero, this vibrational motion is at its absolute minimum (and is considered to have stopped in the classical model). Particles would only *start* vibrating if their temperature were increased *from* absolute zero. Therefore, this statement describes what happens when a substance is heated from 0 K, not the state at 0 K itself.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nWeight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, calculated as the product of its mass and the gravitational field strength (W = mg). The particles that constitute matter (atoms and molecules) have mass. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles and is unrelated to their mass. Therefore, particles possess mass, and consequently weight, regardless of their temperature. Reaching absolute zero does not cause particles to lose their mass or weight.\n\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nGravitational potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position within a gravitational field. It depends on the object's mass, height, and the strength of the gravitational field. Absolute zero relates to the *internal energy* of a substance, specifically the kinetic energy of its particles. A substance at absolute zero has the minimum possible internal thermal energy, but its gravitational potential energy is determined by its macroscopic location (e.g., its height above the ground) and is independent of its temperature."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_135.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "15 at the surface of a liquid, the more energetic molecules can escape from the liquid into the\natmosphere.\nwhich name is given to this process?\na boiling\nb_ condensation\nc_ evaporation\nd_ melting", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C. evaporation\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n**Evaporation** is the process by which a substance in a liquid state changes to a gaseous state. This process occurs at the surface of the liquid and can happen at any temperature below the boiling point. Within the liquid, molecules possess a range of kinetic energies.

The description given in the question\u2014more energetic molecules escaping from the surface of a liquid\u2014is the precise definition of evaporation. This process leads to a cooling effect in the remaining liquid because the average kinetic energy of the molecules left behind decreases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. boiling:** Boiling is a type of vaporisation that occurs throughout the entire volume of a liquid, not just at the surface.

Water is a bad conductor.**\n\nThis conclusion is correct. **Conduction** is the process of heat transfer through a substance without any movement of the substance itself. In this experiment, heat is applied to the top layer of water. For the heat to reach the bottom of the test tube, it would need to be conducted from molecule to molecule through the stationary water column. The observation that the top of the water can be boiling while the bottom remains cold demonstrates that heat energy is not transferred effectively through the water. Substances that transfer heat poorly are known as bad conductors or insulators. Therefore, this experiment shows that water is a bad conductor of heat.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. Water is a bad convector.**\n\nThis conclusion is incorrect. **Convection** is heat transfer through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). It occurs when a part of the fluid is heated, becomes less dense, and rises, while cooler, denser fluid sinks to take its place, creating a convection current. In this experiment, the water is heated from the top. The heated water at the top is already less dense than the cold water below it, so it remains at the top. The denser, cold water stays at the bottom. This setup actively prevents convection currents from forming. Therefore, the experiment does not provide evidence to conclude whether water is a good or bad convector; it simply demonstrates a situation where convection does not occur.\n\n**C. Water is a good conductor.**\n\nThis conclusion is directly contradicted by the experimental evidence. If water were a good conductor, heat would be transferred quickly and efficiently from the boiling water at the top to the cold water at the bottom. This would cause the entire volume of water to heat up rapidly, and the bottom of the test tube would become too hot to hold. Since the bottom remains cold, water must be a poor, not a good, conductor of heat.\n\n**D. Water is a good convector.**\n\nThis conclusion is incorrect. As explained for option B, the experimental setup of heating from the top prevents the formation of convection currents because the less dense hot water stays at the top. If convection were occurring and water were a good convector, the fluid would circulate, distributing the heat throughout the test tube.

Similar to the grazing angle of incidence, this angle is complementary to the angle of reflection (they add up to 90\u00b0).

It is the sum of the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. Since the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, this total angle is twice the angle of reflection (Angle = \u03b8i + \u03b8r = 2\u03b8r). It is therefore not equal to the angle of reflection, except in the trivial case where both angles are zero."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_139.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "19 the diagram shows two diverging rays of light passing through a lens and emerging parallel to\neach other.\nwhich labelled distance is the focal length of the lens?\nthin lens ai\n| he |\n| b fll", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nBy definition, the principal focal point (or focal point) of a converging lens is the point on the principal axis from which diverging rays of light emerge parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens.

The focal length is the distance from the optical centre of the lens to this principal focal point. In the given diagram, the distance B measures from the point of divergence to the centre of the lens, thus representing the focal length.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** This distance represents the thickness of the lens at its optical centre. While the thickness is a physical dimension of the lens, it is not the focal length. The focal length is determined by the curvature of the lens surfaces and the refractive index of the material from which it is made, not its central thickness.\n\n**C:** This distance represents the separation between the parallel rays after they have emerged from the lens.

This occurs because the refractive index of glass is slightly different for different wavelengths (colors) of light.\n\n1.  **Wavelength and Refractive Index:** In the visible spectrum, blue light has a shorter wavelength than yellow light. For glass and other transparent media, the refractive index is greater for shorter wavelengths. Therefore, the refractive index of glass for blue light is higher than it is for yellow light.\n\n2.  **Refraction and Deviation:** According to Snell's law, the amount of bending (refraction) a light ray undergoes when entering or exiting a medium depends on the refractive index. A higher refractive index causes a greater change in the direction of the light ray. Consequently, blue light is refracted more strongly than yellow light at both surfaces of the prism.\n\n3.  **Path through the Prism:** This greater refraction results in a larger angle of deviation for blue light compared to yellow light. The angle of deviation is the total angle through which the light is bent from its original path. In a prism, light is always deviated towards its base. Diagram D correctly illustrates this: both rays are bent downwards towards the base of the prism, and the blue light is deviated through a larger angle than the yellow light.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A**\nThis diagram is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, light passing through a prism is always deviated towards its thickest part, the base. This diagram incorrectly shows the light rays being deviated upwards, away from the base. Secondly, it incorrectly shows yellow light being deviated more than blue light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is refracted more, so it should show a greater deviation.\n\n**B**\nThis diagram correctly shows that blue light is deviated more than yellow light, which aligns with the principles of dispersion. However, it is fundamentally incorrect because it shows the light rays being deviated upwards, away from the base of the prism. When light passes through a prism, it is always bent towards the base.\n\n**C**\nThis diagram correctly shows that the light rays are deviated downwards, towards the base of the prism. However, it incorrectly depicts yellow light being deviated more than blue light.

The charge of an object is determined by the balance between its protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge). In their natural state, atoms are electrically neutral as they contain an equal number of protons and electrons. The process of charging by friction, or the triboelectric effect, involves the transfer of electrons from one object to another. Protons are located in the nucleus of the atom and are not transferred during this process. For an object to become positively charged, it must have a deficit of electrons relative to its protons.

In this case, rubbing the plastic rod with the cloth causes electrons to be transferred from the rod to the cloth, leaving the rod with a net positive charge.\n\n---\n### A) It has gained electrons.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect. Electrons are fundamental particles that carry a negative electric charge. If an object gains electrons, it acquires an excess of negative charge.

A positively charged object has a deficiency of electrons, not a surplus.\n\n---\n### B) It has gained neutrons.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis option is incorrect. Neutrons are subatomic particles located in the atomic nucleus and have no electric charge (they are neutral).

In an alternating current (a.c.) circuit, the voltage supplied by the source periodically reverses its polarity. This causes the direction of the electric field within the conductor to reverse as well. As a result, the net drift of the charge carriers (free electrons) continuously changes direction, oscillating back and forth about their equilibrium positions. This continual change in the direction of charge flow is the defining characteristic of alternating current.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. In a d.c. circuit, the electric current gradually decreases along the conductor.**\nThis statement is incorrect. According to the principle of conservation of charge, electric charge is not consumed or lost as it flows through a conductor in a circuit. Electric current is the rate of flow of charge (coulombs per second). In a simple series circuit, the current is the same at all points along the conductor.

In a d.c. circuit, the free electrons flow back and forth.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The term \"d.c.\" stands for direct current. This means the charge carriers flow in one single, constant direction. In a d.c. circuit, the power source maintains a constant polarity (a fixed positive and negative terminal), creating a steady electric field that pushes the free electrons from the negative terminal towards the positive terminal in a continuous, unidirectional flow.

Incorrect**\n\nThis circuit is incorrect because the ammeter is connected in parallel with the resistor. An ammeter has a very low internal resistance. When connected in parallel, the majority of the current from the power source will bypass the resistor and flow through the ammeter (the path of least resistance). Consequently, the ammeter will not measure the current flowing through the resistor, making it impossible to calculate the resistance accurately.\n\n**C. Incorrect**\n\nThis circuit has two errors in the placement of the measuring instruments.\n1.  The voltmeter is connected in series with the resistor. A voltmeter has a very high internal resistance, so placing it in series will significantly increase the total resistance of the circuit and drastically reduce the current to a negligible value.\n2.  The ammeter is connected in parallel with the resistor. As explained for option A, this is an incorrect connection for measuring the current *through* the resistor.\n\n**D. Incorrect**\n\nThis circuit is incorrect because the voltmeter is connected in series with the resistor. A voltmeter is designed with a very high internal resistance to draw minimal current from the circuit when connected in parallel. By placing it in series, its high resistance will dominate the circuit, severely limiting the current flow. The ammeter reading would be close to zero, and the voltmeter would read a value close to the supply voltage, not the potential difference across the resistor.

The main current from the battery flows towards a junction where the circuit splits into two parallel branches. At this junction, the total current divides, with some current flowing through the top branch (with the 2.0 \u03a9 resistor) and the rest flowing through the bottom branch (with the 1.0 \u03a9 resistor).\n\nAmmeter D is positioned in the main circuit loop, before the current splits into the parallel branches. Therefore, it measures the total current supplied by the battery. Ammeters A, B, and C are located within the parallel branches and measure only the portion of the current that flows through their respective branch.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the sum of the currents in the parallel branches is equal to the total current entering the junction. This means the reading on ammeter D will be the sum of the readings on ammeter A and ammeter B (or C). Consequently, ammeter D will always show the largest reading.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A)** Ammeter A is located in the top parallel branch, in series with the 2.0 \u03a9 resistor. It measures only the fraction of the total current that passes through this specific branch. Since the total current from the battery splits between the two branches, the current measured by A must be less than the total current measured by D. Additionally, because this branch has a higher resistance than the bottom branch (2.0 \u03a9 > 1.0 \u03a9), less current will flow through it compared to the bottom branch. Thus, ammeter A will show the smallest reading of all four ammeters.\n\n**B)** Ammeter B is located in the bottom parallel branch, in series with the 1.0 \u03a9 resistor. It measures the portion of the total current that flows through this branch. Although this branch has a lower resistance and will therefore carry more current than the top branch, it still only carries a fraction of the total current from the battery. The total current, measured by ammeter D, is the sum of the currents in both branches, so the reading on B must be smaller than the reading on D.\n\n**C)** Ammeter C is also located in the bottom parallel branch, in series with the 1.0 \u03a9 resistor and ammeter B. In a series circuit (or a series portion of a circuit), the current is the same at all points. Therefore, ammeter C will show the exact same reading as ammeter B.

It eliminates the need for an earth wire.\n*   **A fuse** protects the appliance itself from damage and prevents fires. It contains a wire that melts and breaks the circuit if the current becomes dangerously high due to a fault or surge.\nAn appliance requires protection from excessive current regardless of its insulation. Therefore, a double-insulated device still needs a fuse.\n\n**B. A device that has a normal operating current of 3.0 A must be protected by a 3.0 A fuse.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The purpose of a fuse is to protect an appliance by breaking the circuit only when the current significantly exceeds the normal operating level. The fuse rating should always be slightly higher than the device's normal operating current. This is to accommodate small, harmless current surges that can occur when an appliance is first switched on. If the fuse rating were exactly the same as the operating current (3.0 A in this case), the fuse would likely blow during normal start-up or with minor fluctuations, rendering the appliance unusable. A more appropriate fuse for a 3.0 A device would be the next standard rating up, such as a 5 A fuse.\n\n**D. The metal casing of an electrical device must be connected to the neutral wire.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. For safety, the metal casing of an electrical device must be connected to the **earth wire**, not the neutral wire. The earth wire is a safety feature that provides a low-resistance path for current to flow to the ground in the event of a fault. If a loose live wire were to touch the metal casing, the earth connection would cause a very large current to flow, which would instantly blow the fuse or trip the circuit breaker. This disconnects the power supply and prevents the metal casing from becoming live, thus protecting the user from a severe electric shock. Connecting the casing to the neutral wire would not provide this essential safety function."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_151.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "31 a student investigates the output voltage induced across a coil of wire by a bar magnet.\nwhen will the induced voltage have the greatest value?\na_ the student slowly moves the bar magnet into the coil of wire.\nb_ the student leaves the bar magnet stationary in the coil of wire.\nc_ the student quickly removes the bar magnet from the coil of wire.\nd_ the student places the bar magnet at rest outside the coil of wire.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**C. The student quickly removes the bar magnet from the coil of wire.**\n\nThis is the correct answer. According to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, the magnitude of the induced voltage (or electromotive force, e.m.f.) in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through it. Magnetic flux refers to the magnetic field lines passing through the coil.\n\nWhen the bar magnet is moved *quickly*, the magnetic flux through the coil changes very rapidly. This rapid rate of change induces the largest possible voltage. Whether the magnet is moved into or out of the coil quickly, the speed of the motion is the key factor that determines the magnitude of the induced voltage.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The student slowly moves the bar magnet into the coil of wire.**\n\nWhile moving the magnet into the coil does cause a change in magnetic flux and therefore induces a voltage, the motion is described as \"slowly\". A slow movement results in a slow rate of change of magnetic flux. According to Faraday's Law, a slower rate of change induces a smaller voltage. Therefore, this action would produce a smaller induced voltage than moving the magnet quickly.\n\n**B. The student leaves the bar magnet stationary in the coil of wire.**\n\nElectromagnetic induction requires a *change* in magnetic flux. If the bar magnet is stationary, even though its magnetic field is passing through the coil, the magnetic flux is constant and not changing. Since the rate of change of magnetic flux is zero, no voltage is induced across the coil.\n\n**D. The student places the bar magnet at rest outside the coil of wire.**\n\nSimilar to option B, if the bar magnet is at rest relative to the coil, there is no change in the magnetic flux passing through the coil. The rate of change of magnetic flux is zero, and consequently, no voltage is induced. For a voltage to be induced, there must be relative motion between the magnet and the coil."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_152.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "32 in which device is the magnetic effect of a current not used?\na electromagnet\nb_ loudspeaker\nc potential divider\ndrelay", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nA **potential divider** is a circuit consisting of two or more resistors connected in series across a voltage source. Its purpose is to produce an output voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage. The operation of a potential divider is based on the principle that the voltage across each resistor is proportional to its resistance (according to Ohm's Law, V = IR). This is a purely electrical effect related to resistance and does not depend on or utilise the magnetic effect of the current flowing through it.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. Electromagnet:** An electromagnet is, by definition, a device that uses the magnetic effect of a current. When an electric current flows through a coil of wire (a solenoid), it generates a magnetic field. The strength of this magnetic field is significantly increased by placing a soft iron core inside the coil. The device functions entirely based on this principle.\n\n**B. Loudspeaker:** A loudspeaker converts electrical signals into sound waves using the motor effect, which is a direct application of the magnetic effect of a current. An alternating current, corresponding to the sound signal, is passed through a voice coil attached to a cone. This coil is placed within the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The current in the coil creates its own magnetic field, which interacts with the permanent magnet's field, producing a rapidly changing force. This force causes the coil and the cone to vibrate, generating sound waves.\n\n**D. Relay:** A relay is an electrically operated switch that uses the magnetic effect of a current to open or close a circuit. A small current flowing through a coil creates an electromagnet. The magnetic force produced by this electromagnet attracts a movable iron armature, which in turn operates a set of switch contacts in a separate, often higher-power, circuit. Therefore, the fundamental operation of a relay relies on creating a magnetic field from an electric current."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_153.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "33 the diagram represents the transmission of electricity from a power station to homes that are\nmany kilometres away. two transformers are labelled x and y.\ntransmission\npylon cables pylon\n\u2014\\\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\\\u2014\nln /n\ncables ix pane ix\n<-\u2014_|\npower in en large fn aes ground\nsain] lan sre v\\_ [1 be be\ntoney | tony |\nsee 7): ee,\nwhat type of transformers are x and y?\na ee ee\na step-down transformer step-down transformer\nb step-down transformer step-up transformer\ncc step-up transformer step-down transformer\nd step-up transformer step-up transformer", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the correct answer C\n\nElectricity transmitted over long distances through cables experiences power loss due to the heating effect of the current. This power loss is calculated by the formula P = I\u00b2R, where I is the current and R is the resistance of the cables. To minimise this energy loss, the current (I) must be as low as possible.\n\nAccording to the power formula P = VI (Power = Voltage \u00d7 Current), for a given amount of power to be transmitted, a very high voltage (V) is required to produce a very low current (I). Therefore, at the beginning of the transmission line, near the power station, a **step-up transformer (X)** is used. This transformer significantly increases the voltage from the power station, which in turn decreases the current.\n\nThis high-voltage electricity is then transmitted efficiently over long distances. However, this voltage is far too high and dangerous for domestic use. Consequently, before the electricity reaches the homes, a **step-down transformer (Y)** is used. This transformer decreases the voltage to a much lower, safer, and usable level (e.g., 230V), which simultaneously increases the current to a level suitable for household appliances.\n\nTherefore, transformer X is a step-up transformer, and transformer Y is a step-down transformer.\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers\n\n**A: step-down transformer (X), step-down transformer (Y)**\nThis configuration is incorrect. Using a step-down transformer at X would decrease the voltage and increase the current leaving the power station. Transmitting this high current over long distances would result in enormous power losses (P = I\u00b2R), making the system extremely inefficient. While a step-down transformer at Y is needed, the initial transformer at X must be step-up.\n\n**B: step-down transformer (X), step-up transformer (Y)**\nThis configuration is the reverse of what is required for an efficient and safe power distribution system. A step-down transformer at X would lead to massive power loss during transmission. Furthermore, a step-up transformer at Y would increase the already high transmission voltage to an even more dangerous and unusable level for homes. Domestic appliances are designed for low voltages.\n\n**D: step-up transformer (X), step-up transformer (Y)**\nWhile using a step-up transformer at X is correct for efficient long-distance transmission, using another step-up transformer at Y is incorrect and dangerous. The electricity arrives at Y at a very high voltage. A step-up transformer would increase this voltage even further, making it impossible to use with standard household appliances and creating an extreme safety hazard.

When this occurs in the DNA of a living cell, it can break the chemical bonds and alter the genetic code. This change in the DNA sequence is known as a mutation. Mutations can have severe consequences: they can disrupt the cell's normal functions, lead to cell death, cause genetic diseases, or transform a normal cell into a cancerous one. Therefore, the ability of ionising radiation to cause mutations is one of its most significant harmful effects.\n\n*   **Beneficial Effect: Kills cancer cells**\n    The same property of ionising radiation that makes it harmful can be precisely controlled for medical benefit. In cancer treatment (radiotherapy), high-energy radiation is focused directly on a tumour. The radiation delivers a lethal dose of energy to the cancer cells, damaging their DNA so severely that they cannot repair themselves or reproduce, leading to their death. Because cancer cells typically divide much more rapidly than most normal cells, they are often more susceptible to the effects of radiation. This targeted application allows for the destruction of cancerous tissue while minimising damage to surrounding healthy tissue, making it a powerful and life-saving medical tool.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Option A:** The statement that killing cancer cells is a harmful effect is incorrect. For a patient with cancer, the destruction of malignant cells through radiotherapy is a highly beneficial outcome.\n\n*   **Option B:** This option incorrectly categorises both effects. Killing cancer cells is a beneficial effect used in radiotherapy, not a harmful one. Conversely, causing mutations in living cells is a primary danger of radiation exposure and is therefore a harmful effect, not a beneficial one.\n\n*   **Option D:** While it is correct that causing mutations is a harmful effect, it is incorrect to also list it as a beneficial effect. The mutations induced by radiation are random and generally detrimental.

It must have sufficient mass to assume a nearly round shape (hydrostatic equilibrium).\n3.  It must have \"cleared the neighbourhood\" around its orbit, meaning it is the gravitationally dominant object in its orbital path.\n\nPluto meets the first two criteria, as it orbits the Sun and is spherical.

Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium.

This means the only significant force acting on the falling rock is the force of gravity (its weight). Near the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is considered constant. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), if the net force (F) on an object of constant mass (m) is constant, its acceleration (a) must also be constant. This constant acceleration is known as the acceleration due to gravity, denoted by *g* (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\n*   **Speed:** Acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes. Since the rock experiences a constant, non-zero acceleration, its velocity must change at a constant rate. As the rock falls, it continuously gains speed. It starts from rest (or a low initial speed) and moves faster and faster as it falls. Therefore, its speed is increasing.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n**A: constant acceleration, constant speed**\nThis is incorrect because constant speed implies that the acceleration is zero. An object only moves at a constant speed if the net force acting on it is zero. However, the rock is acted upon by the constant force of gravity, causing it to accelerate.\n\n**C: increasing acceleration, constant speed**\nThis option contains two contradictions. Firstly, constant speed means the acceleration must be zero, not increasing. Secondly, as explained above, the acceleration due to gravity is constant (when air resistance is ignored), not increasing.\n\n**D: increasing acceleration, increasing speed**\nThis is incorrect because the acceleration of the rock is constant. The force of gravity does not increase as the rock falls, so the acceleration it produces remains constant. While the speed is indeed increasing, the description of the acceleration is incorrect."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_164.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "4 two rectangular blocks consist of different materials.\n\nfour different methods are suggested to compare the two masses.\n1 compare the accelerations with which they fall freely.\n2 compare the values of their lengths x breadths x heights.\n3 hang each in turn from the same spring. compare the extensions.\n4 place one in the right-hand pan of a beam balance and the other in the left-hand\n\npan.\nwhich methods give a comparison of the two masses?\na 1,2and3 b 1and2only c 3and4only d 4only", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "The correct answer is **C**. This is because methods 3 and 4 are valid ways to compare the masses of two objects, while methods 1 and 2 are not.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Method**\n\n*   **Method 1: Compare the accelerations with which they fall freely.**\n    This method is incorrect. According to the principle of equivalence, in the absence of air resistance, all objects in a uniform gravitational field fall with the same constant acceleration, known as the acceleration due to gravity (g). This acceleration is independent of the object's mass, size, or composition. Therefore, observing the free-fall acceleration of the two blocks would yield the same value for both, providing no basis for comparing their masses.\n\n*   **Method 2: Compare the values of their lengths \u00d7 breadths \u00d7 heights.**\n    This method is incorrect. The product of length, breadth, and height calculates the volume of a rectangular block (Volume = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h). The question states that the blocks are made of *different materials*, which implies they have different densities. The relationship between mass, density (\u03c1), and volume (V) is given by the formula: mass = density \u00d7 volume. Since the densities are different, comparing the volumes alone is insufficient to compare the masses. A block with a smaller volume but higher density could have a greater mass than a block with a larger volume but lower density.\n\n*   **Method 3: Hang each in turn from the same spring. Compare the extensions.**\n    This method is correct. It relies on Hooke's Law and the concept of weight. The weight (W) of an object is the gravitational force acting on it and is directly proportional to its mass (m), where W = mg. According to Hooke's Law, the extension (x) of a spring is directly proportional to the force (F) applied to it, as long as the elastic limit is not exceeded (F = kx, where k is the spring constant). When a block is hung from the spring, the applied force is its weight. Therefore, W = kx, which means mg = kx. Since g and k are constant, the extension (x) is directly proportional to the mass (m). The block with the greater mass will produce a greater extension, allowing for a direct comparison of the masses.\n\n*   **Method 4: Place one in the right-hand pan of a beam balance and the other in the left-hand pan.**\n    This method is correct. A beam balance is an instrument designed specifically to compare masses. It operates on the principle of moments. It balances when the turning effect (moment) produced by the weight of the object on one side of the pivot is equal to the moment produced by the weight of the object on the other side. Since the pans are at equal distances from the pivot, the balance will be level only if the masses on both pans are equal. If the masses are unequal, the beam will tilt downwards on the side with the greater mass. This provides a direct comparison of the two masses."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_165.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "5 ameasuring cylinder containing 50 cm? of water is put on a balance.\nwater s| e object\n1509|/ss 210g s49\na solid object is put in the cylinder and the water level rises to 75cm\u2019.\nwhat is the density of the object?\na 0.80g/cm* b= 2.4g/cm\u00ae c 2.8g/cm> d 8.4g/cm?", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe density of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volume.

The law states that an object will remain at a constant velocity (which includes being at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line) unless a net external force acts on it.\n\nThe problem states that the cyclist is travelling at a **constant speed**. This means the cyclist's acceleration is zero. According to Newton's Second Law (Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration), if the acceleration is zero, the net or resultant force acting on the cyclist must also be zero.\n\nThe forces acting in the horizontal direction are the forward driving force, *F*, and the total resistive forces (frictional forces, including air resistance), which act in the backward direction. For the net force to be zero, the sum of the forces in the forward direction must be equal to the sum of the forces in the backward direction.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the total frictional forces must be exactly equal to the magnitude of the driving force *F*.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**B) The magnitude is smaller than *F*, but greater than zero.**\nIf the magnitude of the frictional forces were smaller than the driving force *F*, there would be a net force acting in the forward direction. This unbalanced forward force would cause the cyclist to accelerate (increase in speed), which contradicts the condition that the cyclist is travelling at a constant speed.\n\n**C) The magnitude is greater than *F*.**\nIf the magnitude of the frictional forces were greater than the driving force *F*, there would be a net force acting in the backward direction.

It is not possible for the total frictional force to be zero for a cyclist moving along a road.

The line of action of the force is the straight line along which the force vector acts. Distance A is shown to be measured from the pivot P and meets the line of action of the force at a right angle (90\u00b0).

The calculation of a moment requires the distance to be measured from the pivot.

This is determined by two main factors: the position of its centre of mass and the area of its base. For maximum stability, an object should have a centre of mass that is as low as possible.\n\nWhen an object is tilted, its weight acts vertically downwards through its centre of mass. As long as this vertical line (the line of action of the weight) falls within the base area of the object, a restoring moment is created that will return the object to its original position. If the object is tilted so far that the line of action of its weight falls outside the base area, it will become unstable and topple over.\n\nBy having a very low centre of mass, a larger angle of tilt is required before the line of action of the weight moves outside the base area. Therefore, an object with a low centre of mass is more stable and harder to knock over.\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect options:\n\n**B: The lamp must have a shade which is heavier than the base.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it describes a condition that would make the lamp *less* stable. The centre of mass is the point where the mass of an object is considered to be concentrated. If the shade at the top of the lamp is heavier than the base at the bottom, more mass will be distributed towards the top. This would raise the overall centre of mass of the lamp, making it less stable and easier to topple over. For greater stability, the base should be significantly heavier than the shade to keep the centre of mass low.\n\n**C: The lamp must have a narrow base.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The stability of an object is directly related to the size of its base area. A wide base provides a larger area of support. For the lamp to topple, it must be tilted enough for the vertical line through its centre of mass to fall outside this base area. A narrow base provides a very small support area, meaning that only a small angle of tilt is needed for the lamp to become unstable and fall over. Therefore, to ensure the lamp does not get knocked over easily, it should have a wide base, not a narrow one.\n\n**D: The lamp shade must be wide.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The width of the lamp shade is not the primary factor determining the lamp's stability. The stability is determined by the position of the centre of mass and the width of the *base*. While a wide shade might be an aesthetic choice, if it is also heavy, it could raise the centre of mass, thereby *decreasing* the lamp's stability.

The power developed by an engine is also related to the driving force (F) and the velocity (v) of the vehicle by the equation: Power = Force \u00d7 velocity. A large power can be achieved by having a large force, a large velocity, or a moderate combination of both.

While it is often true that engines with larger volumes (displacement) can produce more power, it is not a strict requirement. Modern technologies, such as turbocharging, allow smaller-volume engines to produce very large amounts of power. Therefore, a large power output does not necessarily require a large engine volume.\n\n**D: The vehicle must be very fast.**\n\nThis is incorrect for a similar reason to option A.

This value represents the actual density of the cube. The volume of the cube is (0.50 m)\u00b3 = 0.125 m\u00b3. The density is mass/volume = 120 kg / 0.125 m\u00b3 = 960 kg/m\u00b3. This is a common distractor that tests the understanding of the difference between pressure and density.\n\n**D) 9400 N/m\u00b2**\nThis option is incorrect. The value 9400 N/m\u00b2 is approximately double the correct pressure of 4704 N/m\u00b2. Such a result would stem from a calculation error, such as mistakenly doubling the force or halving the area when applying the pressure formula (P = F/A). For instance, 2 \u00d7 4704 N/m\u00b2 = 9408 N/m\u00b2, which is very close to 9400 N/m\u00b2.

The kinetic energy is due to the random motion of these particles. As a substance is cooled, its particles lose kinetic energy and move more slowly. At absolute zero (\u2013273 \u00b0C), the particles have the minimum possible kinetic energy. They are not completely motionless (due to quantum mechanical effects known as zero-point energy), but they have the lowest possible amount of vibrational energy.

Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. It depends on the object's mass, the strength of the gravitational field, and its height above a reference point (GPE = mgh). The temperature of a substance is related to the kinetic energy of its particles, not their gravitational potential energy. The particles of a substance at absolute zero would still have mass and exist within a gravitational field, so their gravitational potential energy would not be zero unless they were located at the chosen zero-height reference level, which is an arbitrary condition unrelated to temperature.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Option: C\n\n**Lowest possible temperature/\u00b0C:** 0\n**Particle energy:** particles have least kinetic energy\n\nThis option is incorrect because it identifies the wrong temperature for absolute zero. 0 \u00b0C is the freezing point of water, not the lowest possible temperature. On the absolute Kelvin scale, 0 \u00b0C is equivalent to 273 K, which is significantly warmer than absolute zero (0 K). While the description of particle energy (\"least kinetic energy\") correctly describes the state of particles *at* absolute zero, it does not apply to particles at 0 \u00b0C.

Firstly, the temperature for absolute zero is \u2013273 \u00b0C, not 0 \u00b0C. 0 \u00b0C is simply the melting point of ice. Secondly, the energy of particles at a given temperature is described by their kinetic energy, not their gravitational potential energy.

This occurs when the gas is cooled, causing its particles to lose kinetic energy.\n\nIn the liquid state, the forces of attraction between particles are strong enough to pull them close together, but not so strong as to lock them into fixed positions. As a result, the particles are in close contact but are still able to move and slide past one another. This combination of close packing and mobility is the defining characteristic of the liquid state. Therefore, this statement accurately describes the arrangement and motion of particles after condensation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. They are close to each other and vibrate about fixed points.**\nThis statement describes the properties of particles in the solid state. In a solid, particles are held in a fixed, regular arrangement (a lattice) by very strong intermolecular forces. While they are close together, their movement is restricted to vibrations about these fixed positions. Condensation is the transition from gas to liquid, not to solid.\n\n**C. They are far apart from each other and vibrate about fixed points.**\nThis statement is internally inconsistent and does not correctly describe any state of matter. Particles that are \"far apart\" are characteristic of a gas, while particles that \"vibrate about fixed points\" are characteristic of a solid. In the liquid state, which results from condensation, particles are close together, not far apart.\n\n**D. They are far apart from each other and move freely within the container.**\nThis statement describes the properties of particles in the gaseous state.

All objects emit and absorb thermal radiation. Shiny, silvery surfaces are poor emitters and good reflectors of thermal radiation, while dull, black surfaces are good emitters and good absorbers.\n\nIn the context of the flask, the hot liquid inside emits thermal radiation. The purpose of the silvered walls is to minimise this mode of heat transfer. The inner silvered surface reflects the infrared radiation emitted by the hot liquid back into the liquid. Simultaneously, the outer surface of the inner glass wall, which is also silvered, is a poor emitter of radiation. This significantly reduces the amount of thermal energy radiated across the vacuum to the outer wall of the flask. Therefore, the silvered walls are specifically designed to reduce heat loss by radiation.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. conduction, convection and radiation**\n\nThis option is incorrect because the silvered surfaces are not designed to reduce thermal energy transfer by conduction or convection. Heat transfer by conduction (through a medium by particle vibration) and convection (through the movement of fluids) is primarily prevented by the vacuum between the two glass walls. The vacuum contains very few particles, so there is no medium to conduct or convect heat across the gap. The silvering specifically targets radiation.\n\n**B. conduction and convection only**\n\nThis option is incorrect as it omits the primary method of heat transfer that the silvered walls are designed to reduce, which is radiation. Furthermore, the silvered surfaces have a negligible effect on conduction and convection. These two processes are minimised by other features of the flask, namely the vacuum between the walls and the use of poor conductors like glass and plastic.\n\n**C. conduction only**\n\nThis option is incorrect. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact and vibration of particles. In the flask, heat loss by conduction is minimised by the vacuum (which has virtually no particles) and by using glass and plastic, which are poor thermal conductors. The thin silver coating is applied for its reflective properties to combat radiation, not for its properties as a conductor."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_177.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "17 adrop of water from a tap falls onto the surface of some water of constant depth.\n\u00a9 view from above\nwater waves spread out on the surface of the water.\nwhich statement is correct?\na_ the waves are longitudinal and travel at the same speed in all directions.\nb_ the waves are longitudinal and travel more quickly in one direction than in others.\nc_ the waves are transverse and travel at the same speed in all directions.\nd_ the waves are transverse and travel more quickly in one direction than in others.", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for Correct Answer C\n\nThis statement is correct. Water waves are a type of **transverse wave** because the particles of the water oscillate perpendicular (primarily up and down) to the direction of energy transfer (outwards from the center). The speed of a wave is determined by the properties of the medium through which it travels. For water waves, a key property is the depth of the water. Since the water has a **constant depth**, the medium is uniform. Therefore, the waves will propagate outwards from the source at the **same speed in all directions**, resulting in uniform, circular wavefronts.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n#### A: The waves are longitudinal and travel at the same speed in all directions.\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the type of wave. In a longitudinal wave, the particle oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer (like in a sound wave). In a surface water wave, the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction the wave is travelling, which defines it as a **transverse wave**. Although the second part of the statement is correct\u2014the waves travel at the same speed in all directions due to the constant water depth\u2014the initial classification of the wave is fundamentally wrong.\n\n#### B: The waves are longitudinal and travel more quickly in one direction than in others.\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, surface water waves are **transverse**, not longitudinal. Secondly, the wave speed in a uniform medium is constant in all directions. Since the water is of a **constant depth**, the medium is uniform. Therefore, the waves travel at the same speed in all directions, not more quickly in one direction than another.\n\n#### D: The waves are transverse and travel more quickly in one direction than in others.\nThis statement correctly identifies the waves as **transverse** but is incorrect about their speed of travel. The speed of water waves depends on the depth of the water. Because the problem states the depth is **constant**, the medium is uniform in all directions from the point where the drop lands. Consequently, the waves must travel at the **same speed in all directions**.

White light is a combination of all colours of the visible spectrum. When it passes through a prism, it separates into its constituent colours because the refractive index of the prism's material (e.g., glass) varies with the wavelength of light.\n\nEach colour of light has a different wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength, while blue and violet light have the shortest wavelengths. In a dispersive medium like a prism, light with a shorter wavelength travels slower and is bent, or refracted, more than light with a longer wavelength.\n\nConsequently, red light, with the longest wavelength, is refracted the least and has the smallest angle of deviation. It appears at the top of the spectrum (position 1). Blue light, having a much shorter wavelength, is refracted the most and has the largest angle of deviation. It appears towards the bottom of the spectrum (position 3). Yellow light has a wavelength between that of red and blue, so its angle of deviation is intermediate, placing it between red and blue in the spectrum (position 2).\n\nTherefore, the correct order from top (least deviated) to bottom (most deviated) is red, yellow, and then blue.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: blue, yellow, red**\nThis option is incorrect because it reverses the actual order of dispersion. It suggests that blue light is deviated the least and red light is deviated the most. In reality, blue light has a shorter wavelength and is refracted more significantly than red light, which has a longer wavelength.\n\n**B: red, blue, yellow**\nThis option correctly identifies red as the least deviated colour (position 1). However, it incorrectly places blue before yellow in the spectrum. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than yellow light. This means blue light is refracted more strongly and will have a larger angle of deviation than yellow light. Therefore, yellow should appear above blue in the dispersed spectrum.\n\n**D: yellow, blue, red**\nThis option is incorrect as it misrepresents the entire order of dispersion.

It is likely obtained by mistakenly using the one-way distance to the cliff (790 m) instead of the total round-trip distance in the speed calculation (Speed = 790 m / 4.8 s \u2248 165 m/s). The time of 4.8 s is the time for the echo, which includes the sound travelling to the cliff *and* back to the ship.

An electromagnet consists of a coil of wire, known as a solenoid, wrapped around a core made of a magnetically soft material. Soft iron is the ideal material for this core. This is because soft iron can be very easily magnetised when an electric current flows through the coil, and it loses its magnetism almost completely and very quickly when the current is switched off.\n\nThe defining property of an electromagnet is that its magnetism is temporary and controllable. The magnetic field exists only when the electric current is flowing. This ability to be switched on and off is essential for its applications, such as in electric bells, relays, and lifting magnets in scrapyards. Therefore, an electromagnet is a temporary magnet.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: iron, permanent magnet**\n    While soft iron is the correct material for the core, an electromagnet is fundamentally a temporary magnet, not a permanent one. The purpose of an electromagnet is to create a magnetic field that can be controlled by switching an electric current on or off.

Firstly, neutrons are neutral particles (they have no charge) and are located in the nucleus of an atom. Their movement does not result in an object becoming electrically charged. Charging is due to the transfer of electrons. Secondly, as explained above, the cloth becomes positively charged, not negatively charged.\n\n**D. positive, neutrons**\nThis option correctly identifies that the cloth becomes positively charged.

The most suitable ammeter is one with the smallest range that is still greater than the expected current.\n\nThe range 0\u20135 A is appropriate because the expected current of 4 A falls comfortably within this range. The reading would be large enough on the scale to be read with good precision.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. an ammeter with a range 0\u20130.5 A**\nThis range is unsuitable because its maximum value (0.5 A) is significantly less than the calculated current of 4 A. Attempting to measure a 4 A current with this ammeter would cause the needle to go beyond its maximum scale (off-scale), and could potentially damage the instrument.\n\n**B. an ammeter with a range 0\u20131 A**\nSimilar to option A, this range is too small. The maximum value of 1 A is less than the calculated current of 4 A. The ammeter would not be able to display the reading and could be damaged by the excessive current.\n\n**D. an ammeter with a range 0\u201350 A**\nWhile this ammeter's range (0\u201350 A) can technically measure a current of 4 A, it is not the most suitable choice. A reading of 4 A would represent a very small fraction of the full-scale deflection (only 8% of the 50 A maximum).

Its operation is based on the motor effect. When a direct current flows through a coil placed in a magnetic field, the two sides of the coil that are parallel to the magnetic field lines experience forces in opposite directions. These opposing forces create a turning effect, or torque, on the coil, causing it to rotate. A split-ring commutator is used to reverse the direction of the current in the coil every half-turn, ensuring that the torque continues to act in the same direction and the coil rotates continuously.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. a.c. generator:** An a.c. generator operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which is the reverse of the motor effect. It converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. In a generator, a coil is rotated mechanically within a magnetic field. This movement of the coil through the magnetic field lines induces an alternating current (a.c.) in the coil. Therefore, the turning of the coil is the cause that produces the current, not the effect of the current.\n\n**C. relay:** A relay is an electromagnetic switch. It uses a small current flowing through a coil (the electromagnet) to create a magnetic field. This magnetic field attracts a soft iron armature, which then pivots to close or open a switch in a separate, often high-power, circuit. While a current-carrying coil in a magnetic field is involved, the primary function is to operate a switch through a small linear or pivotal motion, not to produce a continuous turning effect for rotation.\n\n**D. transformer:** A transformer is a static device used to increase or decrease the voltage of an alternating current. It operates on the principle of mutual electromagnetic induction. It consists of two coils\u2014a primary and a secondary coil\u2014wound on a common soft iron core. An alternating current in the primary coil generates a continuously changing magnetic field in the core. This changing magnetic field, in turn, induces an alternating voltage in the secondary coil.

It consists of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core, forming an electromagnet. When a current passes through this coil, it generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field attracts a movable iron armature. The movement of the armature is used to open or close a set of contacts in a separate electrical circuit. This allows a small current in the electromagnet's circuit to control a much larger current in the other circuit. The fundamental principle of operation is the creation of a magnetic force from an electric current, which is the magnetic effect.\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. a heater**\n\nA heater functions based on the **heating effect** of an electric current (also known as Joule heating). It contains a heating element, which is a wire with high electrical resistance. When current flows through this element, the resistance causes electrical energy to be converted into thermal energy, making the wire hot. This heat is then dissipated to warm the surroundings. The primary energy conversion is from electrical to thermal, not utilising the magnetic effect for its operation.\n\n**B. a light bulb**\n\nAn incandescent light bulb works primarily on the **heating effect** of an electric current. It contains a thin filament, typically made of tungsten, which has a very high resistance. As current passes through the filament, it heats up to a very high temperature, causing it to glow brightly (incandescence) and produce light. While any current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field, this is an incidental byproduct and not the intended operational principle of a light bulb.\n\n**D. a remote controller**\n\nA remote controller is an electronic device that operates by transmitting signals using electromagnetic radiation, typically infrared light. When a button is pressed, an integrated circuit generates a unique digital code. This code is used to pulse an electric current through a light-emitting diode (LED), which emits the coded signal as flashes of infrared light.

This is achieved by having fewer turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil (N\u209b < N\u209a).\n\nIn option D, the number of turns on the primary coil is 20, and the number of turns on the secondary coil is 10. Since 10 is less than 20 (N\u209b < N\u209a), this configuration will decrease the voltage. Therefore, it is correctly labelled as a step-down transformer.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** For a transformer to be a **step-up** transformer, the number of turns on the secondary coil (N\u209b) must be greater than the number of turns on the primary coil (N\u209a). In this option, the number of turns on both coils is equal (N\u209b = N\u209a = 5). This configuration results in an output voltage that is approximately equal to the input voltage and is known as an isolation transformer, not a step-up transformer.\n\n**B:** A **step-up** transformer requires the number of turns on the secondary coil (N\u209b) to be greater than the number of turns on the primary coil (N\u209a). In this option, the primary coil has 10 turns and the secondary coil has 5 turns (N\u209b < N\u209a).

This is done to minimise the energy lost as heat in the transmission cables, thus maximizing the efficiency of the electrical grid.\n\nThe amount of power transmitted is given by the equation P = V \u00d7 I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. The power lost as heat in the transmission lines due to their resistance (R) is given by P_loss = I\u00b2 \u00d7 R.\n\nTo deliver a certain amount of power (P) to a town or city, it can be transmitted using either a high voltage and a low current, or a low voltage and a high current. According to the power loss formula, the energy lost is proportional to the square of the current (I\u00b2). Therefore, to minimise this energy loss, it is crucial to keep the current as low as possible.\n\nBy using a step-up transformer at the power station to increase the voltage to a very high value (often over 100,000 volts), the current required to transmit the same amount of power is significantly reduced (since I = P/V). This low current results in a much smaller power loss in the cables, making the long-distance transmission of electricity efficient.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer A\n\nWhile it is correct that electricity is transmitted at a high voltage, the reason provided\u2014for safety\u2014is incorrect. In fact, high voltages are extremely dangerous to living beings. Significant safety measures, such as placing power lines high up on tall pylons and securing substations, are required precisely because of the immense danger posed by high-voltage electricity. The primary reason for using high voltage is to improve the efficiency of power transmission by reducing energy loss, not to enhance safety.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer C\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, electricity is transmitted over long distances at high voltage, not low voltage. Secondly, while low voltage is indeed safer than high voltage (which is why the voltage is stepped down before being supplied to homes), transmitting power at low voltage over large distances would be extremely inefficient. It would require a very high current, leading to substantial energy loss as heat in the cables, making it economically and practically unfeasible.\n\n---\n### Explanation for Incorrect Answer D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it states that electricity is transmitted at low voltage and that this reduces energy loss. Both parts of this statement are false. Electricity is transmitted at high voltage. Furthermore, transmitting at a low voltage would necessitate a very high current to deliver the same amount of power (P = V \u00d7 I). According to the power loss formula (P_loss = I\u00b2 \u00d7 R), a high current would lead to a very large amount of energy being lost as heat in the transmission wires.

They are designed with extensive shielding and strict safety protocols to contain radioactive materials and minimize releases into the environment. The primary sources of background radiation are natural, such as radon gas from the ground and cosmic rays, not man-made sources like power plants.\n\n**D: visible light from the Sun**\nVisible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, but like microwaves, it is non-ionizing. The energy of visible light photons is not high enough to cause ionization. Background radiation consists of ionizing forms of radiation, such as alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Therefore, visible light is not considered a source of background radiation."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_197.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 the graph shows the radioactive decay curve of a substance.\n1000\ncount rate\ncounts/s 750\n500\n250\n0\n0 5 10 15 20 2 30\ntime/years\nwhat is the half-life of this substance?\na 0.5 years b 5 years c 15 years d 30 years", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for the count rate (or activity) to decrease to half of its original value.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial count rate:** From the graph, the initial count rate at time t = 0 is 1000 counts/s.\n2.  **Calculate half the initial count rate:** Half of the initial count rate is 1000 / 2 = 500 counts/s.\n3.  **Find the corresponding time:** Locate 500 counts/s on the vertical axis. Following this level across to the decay curve and then down to the horizontal axis shows that the time taken to reach this count rate is 5 years.\n\nTherefore, the half-life of the substance is 5 years. This can be verified by checking the next half-life: the time it takes for the count rate to fall from 500 counts/s to 250 counts/s is from t = 5 years to t = 10 years, which is also a duration of 5 years.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: 0.5 years**\nAt 0.5 years, the count rate has only decreased slightly from its initial value of 1000 counts/s. It has not yet reached 500 counts/s, which is half the initial value. Therefore, 0.5 years is significantly shorter than the half-life.\n\n**C: 15 years**\nAt a time of 15 years, the count rate can be read from the graph as 125 counts/s. This value is one-eighth (1/8) of the initial count rate (1000 / 8 = 125). Since 1/8 = (1/2)\u00b3, this time corresponds to three half-lives (3 \u00d7 5 years = 15 years), not a single half-life.\n\n**D: 30 years**\nAt a time of 30 years, the count rate has decreased to a value very close to zero. Specifically, 30 years represents six half-lives (6 \u00d7 5 years). After six half-lives, the count rate would be (1/2)\u2076 = 1/64 of its initial value, which is approximately 15.6 counts/s.

The term \"redshift\" refers to the phenomenon where the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) from an object is observed to be longer than the wavelength it had when it was emitted. In the visible spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength. Therefore, a shift towards longer wavelengths is called a \"redshift\".\n\nThis increase in wavelength occurs when the source of the light is moving away from the observer. As the star recedes, the light waves it emits are stretched out in the space between the star and the observer on Earth. This stretching increases the distance between successive wave crests, which is, by definition, an increase in wavelength. Thus, redshift is an increase in the observed wavelength of light caused by a star moving away from Earth. This phenomenon provides the primary evidence for the expansion of the universe.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: a decrease in observed wavelength caused by a star moving away from the Earth**\nThis statement is incorrect because a star moving away from an observer causes the light waves to be stretched, resulting in an *increase*, not a decrease, in the observed wavelength. A decrease in wavelength is known as blueshift.\n\n**B: a decrease in observed wavelength caused by a star moving towards the Earth**\nThis statement describes the phenomenon of blueshift, not redshift. When a light source moves towards an observer, the light waves are compressed, leading to a decrease in the observed wavelength.

In this scenario, the force stretching each spring is the weight of the object suspended from it.\n\nThe problem states that the springs are identical, which means they have the same spring constant (k). The diagram shows that the spring supporting object Y is extended more than the spring supporting object X (e\u1d67 > e\u2093).

As the cyclist applies the brakes to stop, the bicycle's speed decreases, and consequently, its kinetic energy store also decreases. The brakes work by creating a large frictional force between the brake pads and the wheels. According to the principle of conservation of energy, the kinetic energy that is lost must be transformed into another form of energy. The work done by the friction force converts the kinetic energy into thermal energy, which causes the temperature of the brake pads and the wheel rims to increase.

According to this theory, the air in the container is composed of a vast number of tiny, invisible molecules that are in constant, high-speed, and random motion. These air molecules continually collide with the much larger smoke particles.\n\nAt any given moment, a smoke particle is being bombarded by air molecules from all sides. Because the air molecules are moving randomly, the number and force of collisions on one side of the smoke particle are momentarily different from the collisions on the opposite side. This results in a net, unbalanced force that pushes the smoke particle, causing it to move suddenly. A fraction of a second later, the pattern of collisions changes, resulting in a new net force in a different direction. This continuous, random bombardment by the unseen air molecules causes the smoke particle to follow the observed zigzag path.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. They are less dense than air.**\nDensity determines whether an object will rise or sink in a fluid due to buoyancy. If the smoke particles were significantly less dense than air, they would have a tendency to rise. This would result in a general upward drift, which is a directional movement, not the random, haphazard motion observed in all directions. While the particles must be small and light enough to remain suspended in the air for some time, their density is not the cause of the random movement.\n\n**C. They are moved by convection currents.**\nConvection currents are large-scale, collective movements of a fluid (in this case, air) caused by differences in temperature. Hotter, less dense air rises, while cooler, denser air sinks. If convection currents were present, they would cause all the smoke particles in a region to drift together in a coordinated, swirling pattern. This is a large-scale, ordered flow, which is distinctly different from the individual, random, and jerky motion of a single smoke particle.\n\n**D. They gain energy from the light.**\nThe purpose of the light source in this experiment is to illuminate the smoke particles so they can be seen through the microscope by scattering the light. While light does transfer energy, the momentum transferred from photons (light particles) to the smoke particles is extremely small and insufficient to cause the vigorous motion observed. The primary source of the kinetic energy that drives the movement is the thermal energy of the surrounding air molecules, not the energy from the illuminating light. The random motion would still occur in the dark, but it would not be visible."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_211.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "11 howis a temperature in degrees celsius (\u00b0c) converted to a temperature in kelvin (k)?\na_ add 273 to the temperature in \u00b0c.\nb_ divide the temperature in \u00b0c by 273.\nc multiply the temperature in \u00b0c by 273.\nd subtract 273 from the temperature in \u00b0c.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe Kelvin (K) and Celsius (\u00b0C) scales are two common scales for measuring temperature. The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, meaning its zero point, 0 K, is absolute zero\u2014the theoretical temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. The Celsius scale sets its zero point, 0 \u00b0C, at the freezing point of water.\n\nThe size of a single unit is the same on both scales: a temperature change of 1 K is identical to a temperature change of 1 \u00b0C. The only difference between the scales is their starting point (zero point). The zero point of the Kelvin scale (0 K) is equivalent to -273 \u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin, you must add 273 to the Celsius value. The formula for the conversion is:\n\n**T(K) = T(\u00b0C) + 273**\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**B: Divide the temperature in \u00b0C by 273.**\nThis is incorrect. The relationship between the Celsius and Kelvin scales is an additive offset, not a ratio. Since the size of a degree is the same on both scales, a division operation would incorrectly alter the magnitude of the temperature and does not represent the fixed shift between their zero points.\n\n**C: Multiply the temperature in \u00b0C by 273.**\nThis is incorrect.

The temperature and volume increase at constant pressure.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The process described is an example of an isobaric (constant pressure) expansion.\n\n1.  **Temperature Increase:** The problem states that the air is heated. Adding thermal energy to the air increases the average kinetic energy of its molecules, which corresponds to an increase in its temperature.\n2.  **Volume Increase:** As the temperature of the air increases, the molecules move faster and collide more forcefully and frequently with the walls of the cylinder and the face of the piston. This initially increases the pressure inside. This increased pressure exerts a force on the piston that is greater than the force from the constant atmospheric pressure on the outside. This net force causes the piston to move outwards, increasing the volume of the container.\n3.  **Constant Pressure:** The piston is described as frictionless and is free to move. It will continue to move outwards until the pressure exerted by the air inside the cylinder becomes equal to the constant atmospheric pressure pushing on it from the outside. Throughout this expansion, the internal pressure remains balanced with the external atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the process occurs at a constant pressure.\n\nThis phenomenon is described by Charles's Law, which states that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (V \u221d T).\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. The temperature and pressure increase at constant volume.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A constant volume process (isochoric process) would only occur if the piston were fixed in place, preventing any change in volume. In this scenario, the piston is free to move and does move, meaning the volume is not constant. While heating at a constant volume would indeed increase both temperature and pressure, that is not the situation described.\n\n**C. The temperature, volume and pressure all increase.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While the temperature and volume do increase, the pressure remains constant. As explained above, the frictionless, movable piston ensures that the internal pressure of the air equalises with the constant external atmospheric pressure. If the internal pressure were to continuously increase, the piston would continuously accelerate outwards, which is not implied. The system expands to a new equilibrium state where the pressure is the same as it was initially.\n\n**D. The volume and pressure increase at constant temperature.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The temperature does not remain constant; the problem explicitly states that the air is heated. A process at constant temperature is called an isothermal process. Furthermore, for a fixed amount of gas, it is not possible for both volume and pressure to increase simultaneously at a constant temperature (this would violate Boyle's Law, P \u221d 1/V at constant T)."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_213.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13 what increases when the temperature of a copper block increases?\na the number of copper atoms in the block\nb_ the melting point of the block\nc the internal energy of the block\nd_ the density of the block", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nInternal energy is the sum of the total random kinetic energy and potential energy of the atoms or molecules within a substance. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles. When the temperature of a copper block is increased, its atoms gain energy and vibrate more vigorously about their fixed positions in the solid lattice. This increase in the vibrational kinetic energy of the atoms leads to an increase in the total kinetic energy of the system. Consequently, the total internal energy of the copper block increases.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. the number of copper atoms in the block**\nHeating a copper block does not change the amount of substance it contains. The number of atoms is a fundamental property related to the mass of the block. Unless atoms are added to or removed from the block, their number remains constant regardless of temperature changes.\n\n**B. the melting point of the block**\nThe melting point is an intrinsic physical property of a pure substance, which is the specific temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at a given pressure. For copper, this is a fixed value (approximately 1085\u00b0C). Increasing the temperature of the block brings it closer to its melting point, but it does not alter the melting point itself.\n\n**D. the density of the block**\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume. When a copper block is heated, its atoms vibrate more intensely, causing them to move further apart. This leads to an increase in the overall volume of the block, a phenomenon known as thermal expansion. Since the mass of the block remains constant while its volume increases, its density (mass/volume) will decrease."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_214.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "14 a textbook gives the description of a thermal process as \u2018more-energetic molecules escape from\nthe surface of a liquid which causes the liquid to cool\u2019.\nwhich process is being described?\na boiling\nb_ brownian motion\nc_ condensation\nd_ evaporation", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: D\n\n**Evaporation** is a thermal process where a liquid turns into a gas. This occurs at the surface of the liquid at any temperature below its boiling point. Within the liquid, molecules move with a range of kinetic energies. The molecules with the highest kinetic energy, if they are near the surface, may have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction holding them in the liquid. These 'more-energetic' molecules escape from the surface and become gas molecules.\n\nSince the most energetic molecules have left, the average kinetic energy of the remaining molecules in the liquid decreases. As temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a decrease in the average kinetic energy results in a decrease in the temperature of the liquid. Therefore, evaporation is a cooling process. The description provided in the question accurately defines the mechanism and effect of evaporation.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**A: boiling**\nBoiling is also a process where a liquid turns into a gas, but it differs from evaporation in key aspects. Boiling occurs at a specific temperature, known as the boiling point, and it happens throughout the entire bulk of the liquid, not just at the surface. During boiling, bubbles of vapour form within the liquid and rise. The description in the question specifically mentions that molecules escape from the 'surface of a liquid', which is the defining characteristic of evaporation, not boiling.\n\n**B: Brownian motion**\nBrownian motion is the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas). This movement is caused by the constant, random collisions of the fluid's own molecules with the suspended particles. While Brownian motion provides evidence for the kinetic theory of matter (that molecules are in continuous, random motion), it does not describe a phase change from liquid to gas or the process of cooling. It describes the motion of particles *within* the fluid, not their escape from it.\n\n**C: condensation**\nCondensation is the process by which a gas changes into a liquid. It is the reverse of evaporation. During condensation, gas molecules lose kinetic energy and are captured by the intermolecular forces of the liquid state. This process releases energy (latent heat of vaporisation), causing a warming effect on the surroundings, not a cooling effect on the liquid. The description in the question refers to molecules escaping a liquid and causing cooling, which is the opposite of condensation."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_215.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "15 in which situation is radiation the main method by which energy is transferred?\na heating a pan of water using a gas camping stove\nb_ energy reaching the earth from the sun\nc heating the air in a room with a convection heater\nd giving gravitational potential energy to a glider when it is lifted by thermal currents", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nEnergy transfer from the Sun to the Earth occurs across the vacuum of space. The two other methods of heat transfer, conduction and convection, both require a medium (particles) to transfer energy. Since space is a near-perfect vacuum, energy cannot be transferred by these methods. Instead, the Sun's energy travels to Earth in the form of electromagnetic waves, a process known as thermal radiation. This is the only form of heat transfer that can occur through a vacuum.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. heating a pan of water using a gas camping stove**\nThis process involves both conduction and convection as the main methods of energy transfer. The hot gases from the stove's flame heat the bottom of the pan, primarily through convection. The heat then travels through the solid metal pan via conduction. Finally, the water is heated by convection: the water at the bottom is heated by conduction from the pan, becomes less dense, and rises, while cooler, denser water sinks to take its place, creating a convection current that distributes heat throughout the liquid.\n\n**C. heating the air in a room with a convection heater**\nAs its name implies, a convection heater primarily uses convection to heat a room. The heating element warms the air in direct contact with it. This air becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser air from the top of the room sinks to fill the space, is then heated, and also rises. This creates a continuous circulation of air, called a convection current, which transfers thermal energy throughout the room.\n\n**D. giving gravitational potential energy to a glider when it is lifted by thermal currents**\nThis process is driven by convection. Thermal currents are upward movements of warm air. The ground is heated by the Sun's radiation, and it then heats the air above it by conduction. This pocket of warm air, being less dense than the surrounding cooler air, rises. A glider uses this rising air current to be lifted upwards. The energy transfer from the moving air to the glider is a mechanical transfer caused by convection, which results in an increase in the glider's gravitational potential energy."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_216.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "16 the diagram represents a wave.\ni x '\nnaa\nwhich row gives the wavelength and the amplitude of the wave?\n| | wavelength amplitude\na x y\nb y x\ny\ncc gue\nx 2\nd x x\n4 2", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Wavelength:** The wavelength (symbol \u03bb) of a wave is the spatial distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between two consecutive points in the same phase, such as from one crest to the next. The diagram shows that the distance `x` extends from the first crest to the fifth crest. Counting the full cycles between these points (from crest 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5), we can see that the distance `x` encompasses four complete wavelengths. Therefore, the length of a single wavelength is the total distance `x` divided by 4, giving a wavelength of `x/4`.\n\n*   **Amplitude:** The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on the wave from its equilibrium position. The equilibrium position is the horizontal line that would run through the centre of the wave.

Diffraction is defined as the spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture (a gap or opening) or around an obstacle. In this diagram, the incident plane waves, represented by straight, parallel wavefronts, encounter a narrow slit in a barrier. After passing through the slit, the waves emerge with curved wavefronts, spreading out in a semi-circular pattern. This spreading of wave energy into the geometric shadow region is the defining characteristic of diffraction. The wavelength of the waves remains unchanged during this process.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n**A)** This diagram illustrates the phenomenon of reflection. Reflection occurs when a wave strikes a surface and bounces off. The diagram shows plane waves approaching a flat barrier and changing direction upon contact.

Under these specific conditions, the light ray is not refracted into the less dense medium. Instead, it is completely reflected back into the denser medium at the boundary.

Blue light must have a higher frequency than red light. Although the wavelength is correctly shorter, the frequency is wrong.\n\n*   **Option B:** This is incorrect for two reasons. The frequency (190 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b2 Hz) is lower than red light's frequency, and the wavelength (950 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m) is longer than red light's wavelength.

This property is utilised in passive infrared (PIR) sensors for intruder alarms, which detect the IR radiation (body heat) from a person entering a monitored area. A significant harmful effect of infrared radiation is its ability to transfer thermal energy. Excessive exposure to high-intensity IR, such as from industrial heaters or fires, can be absorbed by the skin, leading to a rapid increase in temperature and causing severe skin burns.\n\n---\n### Why other options are incorrect:\n\n**A:** The harmful effect listed is incorrect. Mutations are changes to the DNA within cells and are caused by ionising radiation, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Infrared radiation is non-ionising; its photons do not carry enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules, and therefore it does not cause mutations.\n\n**C:** The use listed is incorrect. The detection of counterfeit bank notes is typically carried out using ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Genuine bank notes have special fluorescent inks and fibres that are invisible in normal light but glow when exposed to UV light, a feature that counterfeit notes often lack.\n\n**D:** The harmful effect listed is characteristic of a different type of electromagnetic radiation. The internal heating of body cells is the primary danger associated with microwaves. Microwaves are absorbed by water molecules deep within body tissues, causing them to vibrate and generate heat from the inside out.

The typical range for human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz). Therefore, ultrasound has a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz.\n\nFurthermore, all sound waves, including ultrasound, are longitudinal waves. In a longitudinal wave, the vibrations of the particles in the medium are parallel to the direction in which the wave's energy is travelling.

Sound waves with frequencies below the lower limit of human hearing (less than 20 Hz) are known as infrasound. Ultrasound, by definition, has a frequency above the upper limit of human hearing (greater than 20,000 Hz).

There are two key features to consider: the pattern of the field lines and their direction.\n\n1.  **Pattern:** The magnetic field lines form continuous, closed loops that emerge from one pole and enter the other. The lines are most concentrated at the poles (the ends of the magnet), which correctly indicates that the magnetic field is strongest in these regions. The lines spread out as they move away from the magnet, showing the field becomes weaker.\n2.  **Direction:** By scientific convention, the direction of magnetic field lines is defined as the direction a free north pole would move if placed in the field. This means the field lines must point away from the North (N) pole and towards the South (S) pole outside the magnet. The arrows on the field lines in this diagram correctly show this N-to-S direction.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B: Incorrect**\n    This diagram is incorrect because the direction of the magnetic field lines is reversed.

In metals, the outer electrons of the atoms are not bound to any single atom. Instead, they are delocalised and form a 'sea' of free electrons that can move throughout the material's structure. An electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge. When a potential difference (voltage) is applied across a piece of copper, these free electrons are able to move in a directed manner, creating a flow of charge, which is an electric current. The high mobility of these charge carriers is why copper has low electrical resistance and is widely used in electrical wiring.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. glass**\nGlass is an electrical insulator. In the amorphous solid structure of glass, electrons are tightly bound to the atoms in covalent bonds. There are no free-moving or delocalised electrons available to carry an electric charge. Since an electric current requires the movement of charge carriers, the absence of mobile electrons in glass means it cannot conduct electricity effectively. Therefore, glass has a very high electrical resistance.\n\n**C. rubber**\nRubber is a polymer and a very good electrical insulator. The electrons within the long-chain molecules of rubber are held firmly in localised covalent bonds. They are not free to move throughout the material to carry an electric current. Due to this lack of mobile charge carriers, rubber strongly opposes the flow of electricity and has a high electrical resistance. This property makes it a common material for the insulation on electrical cables and for safety equipment.\n\n**D. wood**\nDry wood is classified as an electrical insulator. It is composed of organic materials like cellulose, in which electrons are held tightly within covalent bonds. These electrons are not mobile and cannot act as charge carriers. Consequently, dry wood does not allow an electric current to pass through it easily and exhibits high electrical resistance.

In an appliance with a metal case, the earth wire provides a low-resistance electrical path from the metal casing directly to the ground.\n\nIf a fault occurs where a live wire inside the appliance accidentally touches the metal casing, the casing would become live, carrying a high electrical potential. Without an earth connection, anyone touching the casing would provide a path for the current to flow through their body to the ground, resulting in a dangerous electric shock.\n\nHowever, with the earth wire correctly installed, this fault creates a short circuit. A very large current immediately flows from the live wire, through the metal casing, and down the low-resistance earth wire.

The polarity of the magnet (i.e., whether the North or South pole is moved towards the coil) determines the direction of the magnetic field and, consequently, the direction of the induced e.m.f. and current, as described by Lenz's Law. Reversing the polarity will reverse the direction of the induced e.m.f. (e.g., the voltmeter would show a negative reading instead of a positive one), but it will not change its absolute value, or magnitude, provided all other factors remain constant.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: the number of turns per unit length in the coil**\n\nThe magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the total number of turns in the coil (N) through which the magnetic flux is changing. A greater number of turns per unit length results in more wire loops cutting the magnetic field lines for a given section of the coil. This increases the total magnetic flux linkage and, therefore, induces a larger e.m.f.\n\n**C: the speed of the magnet**\n\nThe magnitude of the induced e.m.f. depends on the *rate* at which the magnetic flux changes. Moving the magnet at a higher speed causes the magnetic field lines to cut through the coil more quickly.

An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium atom, consisting of two protons and two neutrons.\n\nWhen the radon nucleus emits an alpha particle, it loses these two protons and two neutrons. The identity of an element is determined solely by its proton number (also known as the atomic number, Z). Since the radon nucleus loses two protons, its proton number decreases by 2. This process, called transmutation, results in the formation of a nucleus of a new, different element. Because the proton number has decreased, the new element has a lower proton number than radon.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It becomes the nucleus of a different isotope of radon with fewer neutrons.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the process of alpha decay changes the element itself. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Since the emission of an alpha particle involves the loss of two protons, the proton number of the nucleus changes. As the proton number defines the element, the resulting nucleus cannot be an isotope of radon; it is a nucleus of a completely different element.\n\n**B. It becomes the nucleus of a different isotope of radon with more neutrons.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, emitting an alpha particle changes the proton number, resulting in a new element, not a different isotope of radon. Secondly, an alpha particle contains two neutrons. When it is emitted, the nucleus loses these two neutrons, so the resulting nucleus has fewer neutrons, not more.\n\n**C. It becomes the nucleus of an element with a higher proton number.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An alpha particle contains two protons. During alpha decay, this particle is ejected *from* the nucleus. Therefore, the parent nucleus loses two protons. This results in a daughter nucleus with a proton number that is 2 less than the original, not higher.

Radioactive materials can emit three types of radiation: alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3). Gamma radiation is the most penetrating of the three. Lead is a very dense material, and this high density makes it extremely effective at absorbing the energy of gamma rays, significantly reducing the amount of radiation that can pass through. Since it can effectively block the most penetrating form of radiation, it will also completely stop the less penetrating alpha and beta radiation. For this reason, lead is the standard material used for shielding in nuclear applications to ensure safety.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: aluminium\n\nAluminium is effective at stopping beta particles, which are more penetrating than alpha particles. However, it is not sufficiently dense to be an effective shield against highly penetrating gamma rays. A container for storing general radioactive sources must provide protection against all types of radiation, including gamma. Therefore, while aluminium is used for shielding in some specific contexts (e.g., blocking only beta radiation), it is not the best all-purpose material for a radioactive storage box.\n\n#### C: paper\n\nPaper is a low-density material with very limited shielding capability. It is only capable of stopping alpha particles, which are the least penetrating type of radiation and can be stopped by a few centimetres of air. Paper provides no significant protection against beta particles or gamma rays, which would easily pass through it. Consequently, it is entirely unsuitable for safely containing radioactive sources.\n\n#### D: plastic\n\nSimilar to paper, plastic is a low-density material and is not an effective shield for radiation. It can stop alpha particles but offers minimal protection against beta particles and virtually no protection against gamma rays. To safely store radioactive sources, which often emit highly penetrating beta and gamma radiation, a much denser material is required.

The seasons are not caused by the Earth being closer to or farther from the Sun, but by the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis, which is approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane.\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun, this constant tilt means that different hemispheres are oriented more directly towards the Sun at different times of the year. When a hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight for longer periods, resulting in summer. When it is tilted away, it receives less direct, more slanted sunlight for shorter periods, resulting in winter. The 365-day orbit dictates the length of this complete cycle, thus explaining the periodic, or repeating, nature of the seasons each year.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**A: the cycle of day and night**\nThis is incorrect. The cycle of day and night is caused by the Earth's rotation on its own axis, not its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth spins, the portion of the planet facing the Sun experiences daylight, while the portion facing away experiences night. This rotation takes approximately 24 hours to complete, which defines the length of a day, not a year.\n\n**B: the cycle of phases of the moon**\nThis is incorrect. The phases of the Moon (e.g., new moon, full moon, quarter moon) are a result of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. As the Moon travels around the Earth, we on Earth see different amounts of the Moon's sunlit surface. This cycle, known as a lunar cycle or synodic month, takes approximately 29.5 days, not 365 days.\n\n**D: the apparent daily motion of the Sun**\nThis is incorrect. The apparent motion of the Sun across the sky from east to west each day is a direct consequence of the Earth's rotation on its axis. From our perspective on a spinning Earth, it appears as though the Sun is moving.

The weight of an object is the gravitational force on an object.**\n\nThis statement is the correct scientific definition of weight. Weight is a force, specifically the force exerted on an object due to gravity. It is calculated using the formula W = m \u00d7 g, where 'W' is weight, 'm' is the object's mass, and 'g' is the gravitational field strength (or acceleration due to gravity). As a force, weight is measured in Newtons (N).\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The weight of an object is the gravitational force per unit mass.**\n\nThis statement describes the gravitational field strength (g), not weight. Gravitational field strength is defined as the force of gravity experienced by each kilogram of mass. Mathematically, g = F/m, where F is the gravitational force (which is the weight, W). Therefore, \"gravitational force per unit mass\" is the definition of 'g', which has units of Newtons per kilogram (N/kg) or metres per second squared (m/s\u00b2).\n\n**C. The weight is zero when the object is falling at constant speed in the Earth's atmosphere.**\n\nAn object falling at a constant speed has reached its terminal velocity. At this point, the net (or resultant) force on the object is zero, which is why it is no longer accelerating. However, this zero net force is a result of two opposing forces being balanced: the downward force of weight (gravity) and the upward force of air resistance. The weight itself is not zero; it is precisely because the object has weight that it falls in the first place. The weight (W=mg) remains constant, as the object's mass and the gravitational field strength do not change.\n\n**D. The weight is zero when the object is in orbit around the Earth.**\n\nAn object in orbit, such as a satellite or an astronaut in the International Space Station, is not weightless. In fact, it is the Earth's gravitational force\u2014the object's weight\u2014that provides the necessary centripetal force to keep it in its orbital path. Without this gravitational force (weight), the object would travel in a straight line and fly off into space. The sensation of \"weightlessness\" experienced in orbit occurs because the object and its surroundings (e.g., the spacecraft) are in a constant state of freefall, accelerating towards the Earth at the same rate. This eliminates any contact forces that would normally give the sensation of weight."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_245.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "5 the diagram shows a load\u2014extension graph for a steel spring.\nthe length of the spring with no load attached is 2.0 cm.\n2 . 0 dde eee\ni i a i i nt i i il\na a\neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n9.8\nterre ere de he aa\nss a\nse |\n4 6 prp ry ery eee\nload vf n ees ee eee es see ees ey eee\nss ey\nsss a\nbecerra\n1.4 ferrer ee\nss a\nsss a |\nhe 441\n925-4\nsss ey s|\nom a a a a a a a a\u201d a\n6 nt a a fn lo i\n9.0 eee eee eee\n0 a em ea i a i i ee te oe\ni a a at 7 a aaa i\neeceee eee\noy sues ceses sense dgauseussseeesarsaeseers\ni i a a 7, al nn i i\ni i a a > na i i i\nssr sss\n0.6 ceeececceee ee ceeeeeeeeeee eee eee\nfe gg el ee eel bg il gg\neg > ae ee eel bu dg il a gg\nsesssuue/4usueuesuessusesueeesaesesaauea\no.4 cee hh\nsss 87 20\nesse 428 see eee eee eee eee\nsss02 2000\nwa sus\u2019 deuuussuesuesgaeseeesseeeserseeseers\na\nsf\np4000 0 |\n(0) 5 a ah a ay ee as a ys a a nos\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7.0 8.0\nextension/cm\nwhich load increases the length of the spring to 6.0cm?\na 0.5n b 1.0n c 1.5n d 2.0n", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe extension of the spring is the difference between its final length and its original length.

By definition, the frictional force always acts in a direction parallel to the surfaces and opposite to the direction of motion or intended motion. Therefore, it is the force that opposes motion between two solid surfaces.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nGravity is a non-contact, fundamental force of attraction that exists between any two objects with mass. On Earth, gravity is the force that pulls objects towards the planet's center. This force acts vertically downwards. While gravity can influence motion (for example, by causing an object to accelerate downwards), it does not inherently oppose all motion. For an object moving horizontally, the force of gravity is perpendicular to the direction of motion, not in opposition to it.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe term \"kinetic\" is an adjective, not a type of force. In physics, it is used to describe concepts related to motion. For example, *kinetic energy* is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, and *kinetic friction* is the specific type of frictional force that acts on an object while it is moving. While kinetic friction does oppose motion, \"kinetic\" by itself is not a force.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nWeight is the specific force of gravity acting on an object's mass. It is calculated as the product of mass and the gravitational field strength (W = mg). The direction of the weight force is always vertically downwards towards the center of the Earth. For an object moving along a horizontal surface, its weight acts perpendicularly to the direction of motion and therefore does not oppose the motion.

The liquid contracts.**\n\nWhen an object is cooled, its particles lose kinetic energy and move less vigorously, causing the object to decrease in size or volume. This phenomenon is known as thermal contraction. In this scenario, the flask is placed in ice, which lowers the temperature of both the glass flask and the liquid inside it. As the liquid cools, it contracts, and its volume decreases. This reduction in the liquid's volume causes the level in the narrow glass tube to fall from its initial position at X to the lower position at Y. While the flask also contracts, liquids generally have a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than solids, meaning the liquid's volume changes more significantly for the same temperature change. Therefore, the contraction of the liquid is the primary reason for the observed drop in the level.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The flask contracts.**\n\nThis statement is physically correct; the glass flask will contract when it is cooled in ice. However, the contraction of the flask would decrease its internal volume. If the container's volume decreases, it would tend to force the liquid level up the tube, causing it to rise. Since the observation is that the liquid level falls to Y, the contraction of the flask cannot be the cause of this change. The effect of the liquid contracting is greater than the effect of the flask contracting, resulting in a net fall in the liquid level.\n\n**B. The flask expands.**\n\nThermal expansion occurs when a substance is heated, causing its volume to increase. In this case, the flask is placed in ice, which causes its temperature to decrease. A decrease in temperature leads to thermal contraction, not expansion. Therefore, the statement that the flask expands is incorrect.\n\n**D. The liquid expands.**\n\nThermal expansion is the tendency of matter to increase in volume in response to an increase in temperature. The liquid in the flask is being cooled by the ice, so its temperature is decreasing. Consequently, the liquid will undergo thermal contraction, decreasing in volume. It will not expand.

An energetic molecule at the surface has fewer bonds to break and is less constrained than a molecule deep within the liquid, making it the only location from which molecules can escape during evaporation.\n\nTherefore, evaporation involves only the most energetic molecules escaping, and this process occurs exclusively at the liquid's surface.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **A) Any molecule can escape and from any part of the liquid.**\n    This statement is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, not *any* molecule can escape; only those with sufficient kinetic energy can overcome the intermolecular forces. Secondly, molecules escaping from *any part* of the liquid describes boiling, where bubbles of vapour form within the bulk of the liquid. The question explicitly states the liquid is not boiling.\n\n*   **B) Any molecule can escape, but only from the liquid's surface.**\n    This statement is partially correct in identifying that evaporation occurs at the liquid's surface. However, it is fundamentally incorrect to state that *any* molecule can escape. A specific, minimum kinetic energy is required for a molecule to break free from the liquid, and most molecules do not possess this energy at any given time.\n\n*   **D) Only molecules with enough energy can escape, but from any part of the liquid.**\n    This statement correctly identifies the energy requirement for evaporation. However, it incorrectly states that molecules can escape from *any part* of the liquid.

This type of image can be projected onto a screen placed at the point of convergence. The ray diagram shows the refracted rays meeting at a single point to form the image, confirming it is a real image.\n\n2.  **Inverted:** An inverted image is oriented upside-down relative to the object. The object is depicted as an arrow pointing upwards from the principal axis, while the image is shown as an arrow pointing downwards below the principal axis. This opposite orientation signifies that the image is inverted.\n\n3.  **Diminished:** A diminished image is smaller in size than the object.

A converging lens produces a real, enlarged image only when the object is positioned between one and two focal lengths (F and 2F) from the lens.\n\n#### C: virtual, inverted, diminished\n\nThis option is incorrect because the image is real, not virtual. A virtual image is formed at a location from which light rays appear to diverge; they do not actually meet.

This phenomenon occurs because the refractive index of the material is dependent on the wavelength of the light. White light is a mixture of different colours, each with a different wavelength. When white light enters the prism, each colour is refracted (bent) by a slightly different amount. Violet light, having the shortest wavelength, is refracted the most, while red light, with the longest wavelength, is refracted the least. This difference in refraction angles causes the colours to spread out, forming a spectrum.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: diffraction**\nDiffraction is the bending or spreading out of waves as they pass through an opening or around an obstacle. While diffraction can also separate white light into colours (as seen with a diffraction grating), the process described, which specifically involves passing light *through* a prism, is known as dispersion. Diffraction is fundamentally about the wave nature of light interacting with an edge or aperture, not its passage through a medium of varying refractive index.\n\n**C: reflection**\nReflection is the bouncing of a wave off a surface. When light strikes a surface like a mirror, it changes direction but does not pass through the material. This process does not separate white light into its component colours. The phenomenon described in the question involves light passing through the prism, not bouncing off its surface.\n\n**D: refraction**\nRefraction is the change in direction of a wave, such as light, as it passes from one medium to another (e.g., from air into glass). While refraction is the underlying physical mechanism that *causes* dispersion, it is not the name for the separation process itself. Dispersion is a specific consequence of refraction where different wavelengths of light are refracted at slightly different angles.

These mutations can result in cell death or uncontrolled cell growth (cancer).\n\n*   **Skin burns by Infrared radiation:** Infrared (IR) radiation is readily absorbed by water molecules in the skin.

It is a longitudinal wave that cannot be heard by a human with normal hearing.**\n\nThis statement is correct for two key reasons:\n\n1.  **Nature of the Wave:** Sound waves are longitudinal waves. This means the particles of the medium (such as air) vibrate parallel to the direction of energy propagation. These vibrations create areas of compression (where particles are close together) and rarefaction (where particles are spread apart).\n\n2.  **Human Hearing Range:** The range of frequencies that a human with normal hearing can detect is typically between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz). Sound waves with frequencies above 20,000 Hz are called ultrasound. The frequencies given in the question, 31,000 Hz and 32,000 Hz, are both well above this upper limit. Therefore, these sound waves are in the ultrasonic range and are inaudible to humans.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is a longitudinal wave with a decreasing pitch.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because although a sound wave is indeed a longitudinal wave, the description of its pitch is wrong. Pitch is the perceptual property of sound that allows for its ordering on a frequency-related scale. A higher frequency corresponds to a higher pitch. Since the frequency increases from 31,000 Hz to 32,000 Hz, if the sound were audible, its pitch would be increasing, not decreasing. More importantly, the sound is inaudible to humans, so the concept of its perceived pitch is not applicable.\n\n**B. It is a transverse wave with an increasing pitch.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the nature of a sound wave. Sound waves are longitudinal, not transverse. Transverse waves are those in which the oscillations of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer (e.g., light waves or ripples on water). While an increasing frequency does correspond to an increasing pitch, the fundamental classification of the wave as transverse is incorrect.\n\n**D.

Therefore, increasing the current will produce a stronger magnetic field. A stronger magnetic field will induce stronger magnetism in the soft iron core, allowing it to exert a greater magnetic force. Consequently, the bar will be able to attract and hold **more nails**.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n#### A: soft iron; it makes no difference\n\nWhile selecting **soft iron** as the material is correct, the statement that a larger current **makes no difference** is incorrect. The strength of an electromagnet is determined by factors including the current, the number of turns in the coil, and the core material. The magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the current. A larger current creates a stronger magnetic field and thus a stronger electromagnet, which would hold more nails.\n\n#### C: steel; it makes no difference\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, **steel** is a **magnetically hard** material. This means that while it is more difficult to magnetise than soft iron, it retains its magnetism after the current is turned off, becoming a permanent magnet. The problem states that the nails drop when the current is off, which would not happen if the core were made of steel. Secondly, as explained above, a larger current does make a difference; it increases the strength of the electromagnet.\n\n#### D: steel; the bar holds more nails\n\nThis option incorrectly identifies the material as **steel**. Steel is a magnetically hard material and would not lose its magnetism when the current is switched off, contradicting the observation that the nails drop. Although it is true that a larger current would create a stronger magnet (which would hold more nails), the choice of steel as the core material is inconsistent with the behaviour described in the problem."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_266.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "26 there is a current j in a resistor of resistance r. the potential difference (p.d.) across the resistor\nis v.\nwhich equation gives the power p dissipated by the resistor?\na p=ir b p=iv c p=l p p=l\nr vv", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nElectrical power (*P*) is defined as the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by a circuit. It is calculated by multiplying the potential difference (*V*) across a component by the current (*I*) flowing through it. The fundamental equation for electrical power is:\n\n*P* = *I* \u00d7 *V*\n\nThis equation is derived from the definitions of potential difference and current. Potential difference (*V*) is the energy transferred per unit charge (*E* / *Q*), and current (*I*) is the rate of flow of charge (*Q* / *t*). Combining these gives Power (*P*) = Energy (*E*) / time (*t*) = (*V* \u00d7 *Q*) / *t* = *V* \u00d7 (*Q* / *t*) = *V* \u00d7 *I*.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: *P* = *IR***\nThis equation is incorrect. The product of current (*I*) and resistance (*R*) is equal to the potential difference (*V*), as described by Ohm's Law (*V* = *IR*). This equation mistakenly equates power with potential difference. While current and resistance are used to calculate power, the correct relationship is *P* = *I\u00b2R* (derived by substituting *V* = *IR* into the correct power equation *P* = *IV*).\n\n**C: *P* = *I* / *R***\nThis equation is incorrect. It does not represent any standard physical relationship in electrical circuits. Power dissipated in a resistor is directly proportional to the resistance (*P* = *I\u00b2R*), not inversely proportional in this manner. The expression *I* / *R* is not a valid formula for calculating power.\n\n**D: *P* = *I* / *V***\nThis equation is incorrect. It is a mathematical rearrangement that does not represent power. If we rearrange the correct power equation (*P* = *IV*) to solve for *I*, we get *I* = *P* / *V*. The expression *I* / *V* is therefore equal to *P* / *V\u00b2*.

Electrical conductors are materials that have charge carriers, typically delocalised or 'free' electrons, which can move through the material to constitute an electric current.\n\nMetals are excellent electrical conductors because their atomic structure consists of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not bound to any single atom and are free to move throughout the metal. Aluminium, iron, and silver are all metals. Therefore, they are all good conductors of electricity. Plastic, on the other hand, is a polymer and an electrical insulator; its electrons are tightly bound within its molecular structure and are not free to move. Consequently, the correct grouping of good conductors from the list provided is aluminium, iron, and silver.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: aluminium and silver only**\nThis option is incorrect because it is incomplete. While aluminium and silver are indeed good electrical conductors because they are metals with free-moving electrons, this option excludes iron. Iron is also a metal and possesses the characteristic sea of delocalised electrons, making it a good conductor of electricity. A complete list of the conductors from the materials provided must include iron.\n\n**C: iron, silver and plastic**\nThis option is incorrect because it includes a material that is an electrical insulator. Iron and silver are metals and are good electrical conductors. However, plastic is a non-metallic material in which electrons are tightly bound to their atoms and are not free to move. This property makes plastic an excellent electrical insulator, meaning it strongly resists the flow of electric current. Therefore, including plastic in a list of good conductors is incorrect.\n\n**D: plastic only**\nThis option is incorrect because it identifies an electrical insulator as a conductor. Plastic is a polymer, a type of non-metal, and it does not have the free-moving charge carriers (delocalised electrons) necessary for electrical conduction. Instead, it is an electrical insulator, a material used to prevent the flow of electricity, for example, as a coating on electrical wires.

The question states that the resistance (R) is increased. To determine the correct statement, we must analyse how V and I must change relative to each other.\n\nIf the current (I) is to remain constant while the resistance (R) increases, the potential difference (V) must also increase to maintain the equality in the equation V = I \u00d7 R. For example, if I = 2 A and R increases from 3 \u03a9 to 4 \u03a9, V must increase from (2 A \u00d7 3 \u03a9) = 6 V to (2 A \u00d7 4 \u03a9) = 8 V. Therefore, the current can remain constant if the p.d. is increased.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis\n\n**A. The current can remain constant if the p.d. is decreased.**\nThis is incorrect. According to Ohm's Law (V = I \u00d7 R), if the current (I) were to remain constant while the resistance (R) increases, the potential difference (V) must increase, not decrease. If the p.d. were decreased while the resistance was increased, the current (I = V/R) would decrease.\n\n**C. The p.d. can remain constant if the current is kept constant.**\nThis is incorrect. Ohm's Law can be expressed as R = V/I. If both the potential difference (V) and the current (I) were to remain constant, the resistance (R) would also have to be constant. This contradicts the initial condition of the problem, which states that the resistance is increased.\n\n**D. The p.d. can remain constant if the current is increased.**\nThis is incorrect. According to Ohm's Law, rearranged as I = V/R, if the potential difference (V) is to remain constant while the resistance (R) increases, the current (I) must decrease.

This is because adding resistors in parallel creates additional paths for the electric current to flow, thereby reducing the overall opposition to the current.\n\nIn Diagram 1, the total resistance of the circuit is simply the resistance of the single resistor, let's call it R.\n\nIn Diagram 2, two identical resistors, each with resistance R, are connected in parallel. The formula for the total resistance (R_T) of two resistors in parallel is:\n1/R_T = 1/R\u2081 + 1/R\u2082\n\nSince the resistors are identical, R\u2081 = R\u2082 = R. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n1/R_T = 1/R + 1/R = 2/R\n\nTo find R_T, we take the reciprocal:\nR_T = R/2\n\nTherefore, the combined resistance in Diagram 2 (R/2) is half the resistance of the circuit in Diagram 1 (R). This value is less than R but, as resistance must be a positive physical quantity, it is greater than zero.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: greater than in the circuit of diagram 1**\n\nThis is incorrect. The total resistance of a circuit increases when resistors are added in series, not in parallel. In a series circuit, the current must flow through each resistor in turn, so their resistances add up (R_T = R\u2081 + R\u2082). Connecting resistors in parallel provides alternative pathways for the current, which always results in a decrease in the total resistance.\n\n**C: the same as in the circuit of diagram 1**\n\nThis is incorrect. Adding an electrical component in parallel with another will change the overall resistance of that part of the circuit (unless the added component has infinite resistance, i.e., an open circuit). As calculated above, adding an identical resistor in parallel halves the total resistance from R to R/2. Therefore, the combined resistance is not the same.\n\n**D: zero**\n\nThis is incorrect. A resistance of zero would imply a short circuit, where there is no opposition to the flow of current. Resistors are components specifically designed to have a resistance value greater than zero. Combining them, whether in series or parallel, will always result in a final resistance that is also greater than zero.

Its primary function is to interrupt the circuit if the current becomes dangerously high, for instance, due to a fault or a power surge.\n\nThe live wire is the conductor that carries the high potential difference (voltage) from the mains supply to the appliance. To effectively and safely stop the flow of electricity to the entire appliance, the safety device must be placed in this wire. When the fuse blows (melts), it creates a break in the live wire, completely disconnecting the appliance from the high-voltage supply. This ensures the appliance is no longer live and is safe to handle.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: the earth wire only**\nThe earth wire is a safety feature that normally carries no current. It provides a path for current to flow safely to the ground if a fault causes the live wire to touch the metal casing of the appliance. Placing a fuse in the earth wire is incorrect and dangerous. If this fuse were to blow during a fault, it would break the earth connection, but the appliance would remain connected to the high-potential live wire, leaving the metal casing live and creating a severe risk of electric shock.\n\n**C: the neutral wire only**\nThe neutral wire completes the electrical circuit and is kept at or close to zero potential (0V). If a fuse were placed in the neutral wire, it would indeed stop the current from flowing and the appliance would stop working when it blows. However, the internal components of the appliance would still be connected to the high-potential live wire. This creates a highly dangerous situation where the appliance appears to be off but is still live, posing a significant risk of electric shock to anyone touching its internal circuitry.\n\n**D: the live wire and the earth wire**\nWhile placing a fuse in the live wire is correct, placing a second fuse in the earth wire is incorrect and unsafe.

This force is determined by factors internal to the motor's operation, not by its overall physical properties like weight. The weight of the motor is the gravitational force acting on its total mass and has no direct influence on the magnitude of the electromagnetic force generated on the coil. Therefore, the graph suggesting that the force *F* is directly proportional to the weight of the motor is incorrect.\n\n### Incorrect Options:\n\n**A:** The force causing the turning effect is directly proportional to the number of turns on the coil. Each turn of the coil acts as a separate current-carrying conductor experiencing a force. By increasing the number of turns, the total force is multiplied, resulting in a stronger turning effect.

Electrons are subatomic particles that carry a negative electrical charge. The nucleus itself is composed of two types of particles: protons, which carry a positive electrical charge, and neutrons, which have no charge (they are neutral).

Isotopes are defined as different forms of the same element. Therefore, by definition, all isotopes of a particular element must have the same number of protons. For instance, all isotopes of carbon (e.g., Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14) have 6 protons. This shared number of protons ensures they have the same chemical properties and belong to the same element.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A) They are radioactive.**\nThis statement is not always true. Radioactivity arises from an unstable nucleus. While many isotopes are unstable and therefore radioactive (known as radioisotopes), many other isotopes are perfectly stable. For example, Carbon-12 is a stable isotope of carbon, whereas Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope. Since stable isotopes exist, it is incorrect to state that all isotopes must be radioactive.\n\n**B) They are unstable.**\nThis statement is incorrect for the same reason as statement A. Nuclear instability leads to radioactivity. An atom is considered unstable if its nucleus is prone to decay. However, most elements have one or more stable isotopes whose nuclei do not decay. For example, the most common isotope of hydrogen, Protium (\u00b9H), and another isotope, Deuterium (\u00b2H), are both stable. Only some isotopes, like Tritium (\u00b3H), are unstable. Therefore, not all isotopes are unstable.\n\n**C) They have the same number of neutrons.**\nThis statement is a direct contradiction of the definition of isotopes. Isotopes of an element are distinguished from one another by having a *different* number of neutrons in their nuclei. For example, Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 are both isotopes of uranium. They both have 92 protons, but Uranium-235 has 143 neutrons, while Uranium-238 has 146 neutrons.

The rate of this decay is an intrinsic property of the specific radioisotope and is not affected by external physical or chemical conditions such as temperature, pressure, or being encased in another material like glass.

The Moon does not produce its own light; it reflects sunlight. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon change. This change in position means that from our perspective on Earth, we see different amounts of the Moon's sunlit half.\n\nWhen the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, the side facing us is not illuminated, resulting in a New Moon. When the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, the entire side of the Moon facing us is illuminated, resulting in a Full Moon. At other points in its orbit, we see parts of the sunlit side, which appear as crescent, quarter, or gibbous phases. This entire cycle of phases is a direct consequence of the Moon's movement around the Earth.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. the movement of the Earth around the Sun**\nThe movement of the Earth around the Sun is called its revolution. This annual journey, combined with the tilt of the Earth's axis, is the cause of the seasons. It does not, however, cause the monthly cycle of the Moon's phases. The lunar phases complete a cycle in approximately 29.5 days, which is far too short a period to be caused by the Earth's year-long orbit around the Sun.\n\n**B. the movement of the Moon around the Sun**\nWhile it is true that the Moon orbits the Sun along with the Earth, this is not the direct cause of the phases we observe. The phases are determined by the viewing angle from Earth to the Moon relative to the direction of sunlight. This angle changes significantly over the Moon's ~29.5-day orbit around the Earth. The Moon's orbit around the Sun takes a full year and does not account for the rapid, monthly changes in its appearance.\n\n**D. the movement of the Sun around the Moon**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. In our solar system, the Sun is the central star, and celestial bodies like planets and their moons orbit it due to its immense gravitational pull. The Sun does not orbit the Moon.

Since the water displacement method relies solely on volume measurements, the ruler is a superfluous tool for this specific task.\n\n**D: the ruler only**\nThis option is incorrect. A ruler is used to measure length. It cannot directly measure volume. For an irregularly shaped object, one cannot measure simple dimensions and apply a geometric formula to calculate volume.

The scale is marked in cubic centimetres (cm\u00b3). The numbered markings are in intervals of 5 cm\u00b3 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Between each numbered marking, there are five subdivisions. Therefore, each subdivision represents 1 cm\u00b3. The bottom of the meniscus (the curved upper surface of the liquid) aligns exactly with the 20 cm\u00b3 mark. Thus, the volume of the liquid is 20 cm\u00b3.\n\nSubstituting the mass and volume into the density formula:\n\u03c1 = 16 g / 20 cm\u00b3\n\u03c1 = 0.80 g/cm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the density of the liquid is 0.80 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**B: 1.3 g/cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. It may be the result of incorrectly inverting the density formula, by dividing the volume by the mass (V/m) instead of the mass by the volume (m/V). Calculating 20 cm\u00b3 / 16 g gives 1.25 cm\u00b3/g, which is approximately 1.3. However, this calculation is conceptually incorrect for finding density.\n\n**C: 36 g/cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. It appears to be the result of adding the mass and the volume (16 + 20 = 36). Physical quantities with different units, such as mass (g) and volume (cm\u00b3), cannot be added together to find density. Density is a ratio of mass to volume, not a sum.\n\n**D: 320 g/cm\u00b3**\nThis value is incorrect. It is obtained by multiplying the mass and the volume (16 g \u00d7 20 cm\u00b3 = 320 g\u00b7cm\u00b3). The formula for density requires division of mass by volume, not multiplication.

The velocity of the object changes.**\n\nAccording to Newton's Second Law of Motion, a net or unbalanced force acting on an object will cause it to accelerate. The law is mathematically expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is its acceleration.\n\nIn this scenario, a \"single force\" is acting on the object. This means there is a non-zero net force. Since the object has mass, this net force will produce an acceleration. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. Therefore, if the object is accelerating, its velocity must be changing. This change could be an increase in speed, a decrease in speed, or a change in its direction of motion.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The density of the object changes.**\n\nDensity is an intrinsic property of a substance, defined as its mass per unit volume (\u03c1 = m/V). The problem states that the volume of the object does not change. Furthermore, the mass of an object is a measure of the matter it contains and does not change when a force is applied. Since both the mass and the volume of the object remain constant, its density must also remain constant.\n\n**C. The mass of the object changes.**\n\nMass is the amount of matter in an object. It is a fundamental, scalar quantity that is constant for a given object, regardless of its location or state of motion (in the context of classical mechanics). Applying a force to an object changes its motion (i.e., its velocity), but it does not add or remove matter from the object, so its mass remains unchanged.\n\n**D. The weight of the object changes.**\n\nWeight is the gravitational force exerted on an object and is calculated by the formula W = mg, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity (or gravitational field strength).

Therefore, the motor that takes 1.5 s to lift the weight produces the most power.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPower is the rate of doing work (P = W/t). Since all motors perform the same amount of work, the power produced is inversely proportional to the time taken. A time of 6.0 s is longer than 1.5 s. A longer time to do the same amount of work results in a lower rate of work done, and therefore, less power. The motor taking 6.0 s is less powerful than the motor taking 1.5 s.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe relationship between power, work, and time is given by the formula P = W/t. For a constant amount of work, power and time are inversely proportional. This means a longer time results in lower power. The time of 15 s is significantly longer than 1.5 s, meaning the motor taking 15 s produces substantially less power than the motor that completes the task in 1.5 s.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPower is defined as work done per unit time (P = W/t). The problem states that the work done is the same for all motors. According to the formula, if the work is constant, the power is greatest when the time is smallest.

This phase transition occurs when gas particles lose thermal energy, causing them to slow down. As their kinetic energy decreases, the intermolecular forces of attraction between the particles become strong enough to pull them closer together, forming the more ordered structure of a liquid. This process is the reverse of boiling or evaporation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: boiling**\nBoiling is the phase transition from a liquid to a gas that occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point. During boiling, the particles throughout the liquid gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them in the liquid state, allowing them to escape as a gas. This is the opposite of a gas turning into a liquid.\n\n**C: freezing**\nFreezing, also known as solidification, is the phase transition from a liquid to a solid.

This phenomenon provides evidence for the kinetic theory of matter, which states that particles in a fluid (liquid or gas) are in continuous, random motion.\n\nThe pollen grain itself is too large to be affected by its own kinetic energy. However, it is suspended in water, which is made up of a vast number of tiny, invisible water molecules. These water molecules are in constant, high-speed, random motion.\n\nAs the water molecules move, they collide with the much larger pollen grain from all directions. At any given instant, it is highly probable that the number and force of collisions on one side of the pollen grain will be slightly different from the collisions on the other sides. This creates a momentary, unbalanced net force on the pollen grain, causing it to move a short distance in a specific direction.\n\nAn instant later, the random arrangement of colliding water molecules changes, resulting in a new net force in a different direction. This causes the pollen grain to change its path abruptly. The continuous repetition of this process results in the pollen grain following a haphazard, erratic, and unpredictable path. Diagram A correctly illustrates this jagged, random movement characteristic of Brownian motion.\n\n### Explanations for the incorrect options:\n\n**B**\nThis diagram shows a path composed of straight lines and right-angle turns, as if the particle were moving on a grid. This is an overly ordered and systematic motion. The forces causing Brownian motion arise from random collisions from all possible directions, not just from directions perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the resulting path should show changes in direction at random angles, not exclusively at 90 degrees.\n\n**C**\nThis diagram depicts a smooth, wavy motion. A regular, periodic path like this would be caused by a continuous, oscillating force, such as a mechanical wave passing through the water. Brownian motion, however, is the result of discrete, random impacts from individual molecules. These impacts cause abrupt, jerky changes in direction, not the smooth, predictable curve shown in this diagram.\n\n**D**\nThis diagram illustrates a spiral path. A spiral motion is highly ordered and would require a persistent central force (a force constantly directed towards or away from a single point) combined with rotational motion. The forces responsible for Brownian motion are random and constantly changing in both magnitude and direction; they are not organised around a central point.

The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, where 0 K represents absolute zero, the point at which particles have minimal kinetic energy. The Celsius scale sets its zero point (0 \u00b0C) at the freezing point of water.\n\nAbsolute zero (0 K) corresponds to -273.15 \u00b0C. For most practical purposes, this is approximated as -273 \u00b0C. The size of one unit is the same on both scales; a temperature change of 1 K is equivalent to a temperature change of 1 \u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, to convert from degrees Celsius to kelvin, one adds 273:\n*   T (in K) = \u03b8 (in \u00b0C) + 273\n\nTo find the relationship for the temperature in degrees Celsius (\u03b8), we must rearrange this formula by subtracting 273 from both sides:\n*   \u03b8 (in \u00b0C) = T (in K) - 273\n\nThis shows that the Celsius temperature is always 273 units less than the Kelvin temperature.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: \u03b8 = T + 273**\nThis equation incorrectly suggests adding 273 to the Kelvin temperature to find the Celsius temperature. This is the reverse of the correct procedure. For example, the freezing point of water is 273 K. Using this formula would give \u03b8 = 273 + 273 = 546 \u00b0C, which is incorrect. This formula describes the conversion from Celsius to Kelvin (T = \u03b8 + 273), not from Kelvin to Celsius.\n\n**C: \u03b8 = T + 373**\nThis equation is incorrect. The value 373 is significant as it is the approximate boiling point of water on the Kelvin scale (100 \u00b0C + 273 = 373 K). However, it is not the conversion factor or the offset between the two scales. The offset is determined by the value of absolute zero on the Celsius scale, which is -273 \u00b0C.\n\n**D: \u03b8 = T - 373**\nThis equation is also incorrect. While it correctly identifies that a subtraction is needed to convert from Kelvin to Celsius, it uses the wrong value. The value 373 represents the boiling point of water in Kelvin, not the offset between the scales. Applying this formula to the boiling point of water (373 K) would yield \u03b8 = 373 - 373 = 0 \u00b0C, which is the freezing point, not the boiling point.

Work done by stirring increases the internal energy of the water.**\n\nThis statement is the correct conclusion based on the principles of thermodynamics. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the change in a system's internal energy (\u0394U) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) plus the work done on the system (W). The formula is \u0394U = Q + W.\n\n1.  **Work Done:** Stirring the water involves applying a force to move the paddle or stirrer through the water. This action is a form of mechanical work being done *on* the water.\n2.  **Insulated Tub:** The term \"insulated\" is critical. It means that there is no (or negligible) heat transfer between the water and its surroundings. Therefore, Q \u2248 0.\n3.  **Temperature Increase:** An increase in temperature is an indicator of an increase in the internal energy of the substance. Internal energy is the sum of the random kinetic and potential energies of the molecules. A higher temperature means the molecules have a higher average kinetic energy.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since Q is zero and the temperature (and thus internal energy) increases, the energy must have come from the work done on the system. The mechanical energy from stirring is converted into the internal energy of the water, causing its temperature to rise. This experiment, famously performed by James Joule, demonstrates the equivalence of mechanical work and heat in changing a system's internal energy.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Temperature is a store of energy.**\n\nThis statement is conceptually incorrect. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It is an indicator of the level of internal energy, but it is not energy itself. The energy that is stored within the substance is called internal energy, which is the total kinetic and potential energy of all its particles.\n\n**B. The water absorbs heat from the surroundings.**\n\nThis is contradicted by the experimental setup. The experiment specifies that the water is in an \"insulated tub.\" The purpose of insulation is to prevent the transfer of heat between the system (the water) and its surroundings. Therefore, the increase in temperature cannot be attributed to heat absorption from the outside. The experiment is designed specifically to show that a temperature change can occur without heat transfer.\n\n**D. Energy is not conserved.**\n\nThis statement contradicts one of the most fundamental principles in physics, the law of conservation of energy. This experiment is actually a classic demonstration *of* energy conservation. It shows that energy is not lost but is transformed from one form (mechanical work from stirring) into another form (internal energy of the water, observed as a temperature increase). The total amount of energy remains constant."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_293.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "13 solids expand when heated and contract when cooled.\nin which example is there a useful application of expansion and not an unwanted effect?\na bridges\nb railway lines\nc_ telephone cables\nd_ thermostats", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nA thermostat is a device designed to regulate temperature. Many thermostats operate using a bimetallic strip. This strip consists of two different metals, such as steel and brass, which have different coefficients of thermal expansion, bonded together. When the temperature rises, both metals expand, but one expands more than the other. This differential expansion causes the strip to bend. This bending action is engineered to act as a switch, either making or breaking an electrical circuit. For example, in an iron, when the desired temperature is reached, the bimetallic strip bends enough to break the circuit, turning off the heating element. When it cools and straightens, it reconnects the circuit, turning the heat back on. This is a direct and intentional use of the principle of thermal expansion to perform a specific, useful function.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. bridges:**\nThe thermal expansion of materials used in bridges, particularly steel and concrete, is an unwanted effect that must be managed. As temperatures rise, a bridge will expand in length. If this expansion is not accommodated, it would create immense internal stress, potentially causing the structure to buckle and fail. To prevent this, engineers incorporate expansion joints, which are gaps that allow the bridge sections to move freely as they expand and contract. Therefore, the design of bridges accounts for expansion, but the expansion itself is a problem to be solved, not a useful application.\n\n**B. railway lines:**\nSimilar to bridges, the expansion of steel railway lines due to heating from the sun is a significant and unwanted effect. If the tracks were laid as a continuous, constrained piece, the expansion on a hot day would cause them to buckle, creating a severe derailment hazard. To counteract this, small gaps are deliberately left between sections of the rail, allowing them space to expand into. The expansion is a problematic phenomenon that requires a specific engineering solution, not a useful principle being applied.\n\n**C. telephone cables:**\nOverhead telephone and power cables expand in the heat of summer and contract in the cold of winter. This is an unwanted effect. The cables are intentionally hung with a noticeable sag to accommodate this. If they were strung too tightly, the contraction in cold weather could increase the tension to the point where the cables or their supporting poles could break. The expansion is not used for any function; rather, its effects must be accounted for during installation to prevent damage."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_294.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "14 arod is made half of aluminium and half of glass.\na pin is attached to each end of the rod by wax.\nthe rod is heated at the centre.\na pin falls off when the wax melts.\naluminium glass\na an fe\npin p pinq\nheat\nwhich statement is correct?\na pin p falls off first because aluminium is a better thermal conductor than glass.\nb_ pin p falls off first because aluminium is a worse thermal conductor than glass.\nc pin q falls off first because glass is a better thermal conductor than aluminium.\nd_ pin q falls off first because glass is a worse thermal conductor than aluminium.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer (A)\n\nThis question assesses the understanding of thermal conduction through different materials. Heat is transferred from the center of the rod outwards towards the ends through the process of conduction. The rate at which heat is conducted depends on the thermal conductivity of the material.\n\nAluminium is a metal, and metals are generally excellent thermal conductors. This is because they have a lattice of positive ions and a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. When heated, these free electrons gain kinetic energy and move rapidly throughout the metal, transferring thermal energy quickly via collisions.\n\nGlass, on the other hand, is a non-metal and a poor thermal conductor (a thermal insulator). It lacks free electrons, so heat is transferred much more slowly through the vibration of its fixed atoms.\n\nSince aluminium is a much better thermal conductor than glass, heat will travel from the center of the rod to the end with pin P significantly faster than it travels to the end with pin Q. Consequently, the wax holding pin P will reach its melting point and melt first, causing pin P to fall before pin Q.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. Pin P falls off first because aluminium is a worse thermal conductor than glass.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the reason provided contradicts the observation. While it correctly states that pin P falls off first, it incorrectly claims that aluminium is a worse thermal conductor than glass. In fact, aluminium is a much better thermal conductor. If it were a worse conductor, heat would travel more slowly through it, and pin P would fall off after pin Q.\n\n**C. Pin Q falls off first because glass is a better thermal conductor than aluminium.**\nThis statement is incorrect in both its observation and its reasoning. Pin Q is attached to the glass side. Since glass is a poor thermal conductor compared to aluminium, heat will reach pin Q much more slowly. Therefore, pin Q will fall off last, not first. The claim that glass is a better thermal conductor than aluminium is also scientifically inaccurate.\n\n**D. Pin Q falls off first because glass is a worse thermal conductor than aluminium.**\nThis statement contains a correct piece of information but draws the wrong conclusion from it. It is true that glass is a worse thermal conductor than aluminium. However, this property means that heat will be transferred *more slowly* through the glass.

White surfaces are good reflectors of infrared radiation.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The primary way the Sun transfers heat to the Earth is through thermal radiation, which consists of a spectrum of electromagnetic waves, including infrared radiation. To keep a building cool in a hot climate, it is essential to minimise the amount of this solar radiation that is absorbed. White, and particularly shiny, surfaces are poor absorbers of radiation because they are very effective at reflecting it. By painting a house white, a large proportion of the incoming infrared radiation from the sun is reflected away from the building, rather than being absorbed. This significantly reduces the amount of heat energy transferred to the house, helping to keep the interior temperature cooler.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. White surfaces are good conductors of infrared radiation.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it confuses two different concepts: heat conduction and thermal radiation. Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through a material via direct contact and collision of its particles. Radiation is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves. A surface does not \"conduct\" radiation; it reflects, absorbs, or transmits it. Furthermore, the paint layer on a house is typically very thin and generally a poor conductor of heat (a thermal insulator), so its conductive properties are not the primary reason for its use in temperature control.\n\n**C. White surfaces are good absorbers of infrared radiation.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. White surfaces are poor absorbers of infrared radiation. Surfaces that appear dark, especially matte black surfaces, are good absorbers of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. If houses in hot countries were painted with a material that was a good absorber of infrared radiation, the house would absorb a large amount of energy from the sun, causing the interior to become very hot. This is the opposite of the desired effect.\n\n**D. White surfaces are good emitters of infrared radiation.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. According to Kirchhoff's Law of thermal radiation, surfaces that are good absorbers of radiation are also good emitters, and poor absorbers are poor emitters. Since white surfaces are poor absorbers of infrared radiation, they are also poor emitters. While a good emitter would help a house cool down by radiating its own heat away (especially at night), the primary goal in a hot climate is to prevent the house from heating up during the day. The most effective way to do this is by reflecting incoming solar radiation, not by emitting it.

It represents the spatial period of the wave, meaning the length over which the wave's shape repeats itself. The symbol for wavelength is the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. amplitude**\nThe **amplitude** is the maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating medium from its equilibrium (rest) position. In a transverse wave, it is the height of a crest or the depth of a trough measured from the central axis. Amplitude is related to the energy of the wave, not the distance between its repeating parts.\n\n**B. period**\nThe **period (T)** of a wave is the time taken for one complete oscillation to occur, or the time it takes for one full wavelength to pass a fixed point.

This change in speed leads to a phenomenon called refraction, which involves changes in both the wavelength and the direction of the waves.\n\n1.  **Change in Wavelength:** The relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the equation v = f\u03bb. When a wave passes from one medium to another, its frequency remains constant. Therefore, as the wave speed (v) decreases upon entering the shallow water, its wavelength (\u03bb) must also decrease. In the diagram, the wavelength is represented by the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines (wavefronts). A decrease in wavelength means the wavefronts should be closer together in the shallow water than in the deep water.\n\n2.  **Change in Direction (Refraction):** When a wave slows down as it crosses a boundary at an angle, it bends towards the normal. The normal is an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the boundary surface at the point where the wave enters the new medium. This bending results in the angle of refraction (the angle between the wave's direction and the normal in the shallow water) being smaller than the angle of incidence (the angle in the deep water).\n\nDiagram A correctly shows both of these effects: the wavefronts are closer together in the shallow water, indicating a decreased wavelength, and the direction of wave travel has bent towards the normal, which is the correct change in direction for a wave that is slowing down.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows the opposite of what occurs when waves enter shallow water. It depicts the wavelength increasing (the wavefronts are farther apart) and the wave bending away from the normal. An increase in wavelength and bending away from the normal would only occur if the wave were speeding up, which is contrary to the behaviour of water waves moving from deep to shallow water.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows an increase in wavelength. While the direction of refraction shown (bending towards the normal) is correct for a wave slowing down, the wavefronts are depicted as being farther apart in the shallow water. According to the wave equation (v = f\u03bb), a decrease in speed must result in a corresponding decrease in wavelength, not an increase. Therefore, this representation is physically inconsistent.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows the wrong direction of refraction. Although it correctly depicts the wavelength decreasing (the wavefronts are closer together), which is consistent with the wave slowing down, it shows the wave bending away from the normal. Bending away from the normal occurs when a wave speeds up, not when it slows down.

This principle is a fundamental characteristic of how converging lenses manipulate light. Since the light source in this scenario is placed at F\u2081, the emerging beam of light will travel parallel to the principal axis. This arrangement is used in devices like spotlights and collimators to produce a parallel beam.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the incorrect answers:\n\n*   **A: The beam converges to F\u2082.**\n    For a beam of light to converge to the second principal focus (F\u2082), the incident rays striking the lens must be parallel to the principal axis. In this case, the light source is placed at the first principal focus (F\u2081), causing the incident rays to diverge from this point, not travel parallel to the axis. Therefore, the emerging beam cannot converge at F\u2082.\n\n*   **B: The beam converges to a point to the right of F\u2082.**\n    For light rays to converge at a finite point (forming a real image) after passing through a converging lens, the object (the light source) must be placed at a distance greater than the focal length from the lens (i.e., to the left of F\u2081).

The rays would then appear to diverge from a point on the same side as the object. Since the source is placed exactly at F\u2081, a virtual image is not formed, and the emerging rays do not diverge.

The equation *i* = *r* represents the Law of Reflection. In the context of light and optics, *i* is the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming (incident) ray and the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface). The variable *r* is the angle of reflection, which is the angle between the outgoing (reflected) ray and the normal. The Law of Reflection states that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. This fundamental principle governs how light bounces off surfaces, such as a plane mirror.\n\n---\n**A. diffraction due to a gap**\n\nDiffraction is the phenomenon where waves, such as light, bend or spread out as they pass through an aperture (a gap) or around an obstacle.

Diffraction is typically described by relationships that involve wavelength and the dimensions of the gap.\n\n---\n**B. dispersion of light by a prism**\n\nDispersion is the process by which white light is separated into its constituent colours (the spectrum) when it passes through a medium like a prism. This occurs because the refractive index of the material (e.g., glass) is slightly different for each colour (wavelength) of light, causing each colour to be refracted at a slightly different angle. While dispersion involves refraction, it is not described by the simple formula *i* = *r*.\n\n---\n**D. refraction as light enters glass**\n\nRefraction is the change in direction of a wave, such as light, as it passes from one medium to another (for example, from air into glass).

Since the wavelength of R (2.6 x 10\u00b3 m) is much greater than the wavelength of P (3.2 x 10\u207b\u00b3 m), R must be the radio wave and P the microwave."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_302.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "22 a healthy human ear is able to hear a range of frequencies.\nwhat is this approximate range?\na 10hz to 1000hz\nb  20hz to 2000hz\nc 20hz to 20000hz\nd  200hz to 200000 hz", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe range of frequencies that a healthy human ear can detect is known as the audible range. This range is approximately from 20 Hertz (Hz) to 20 000 Hertz (20 kHz). Frequency, measured in Hz, corresponds to the pitch of a sound. A frequency of 20 Hz represents a very low-pitched sound (deep bass), while 20 000 Hz represents a very high-pitched sound. Frequencies below 20 Hz are termed infrasound, and those above 20 000 Hz are termed ultrasound, both of which are inaudible to humans. This range is typical for young, healthy individuals and tends to decrease, especially at the higher frequencies, with age.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: 10 Hz to 1000 Hz**\nThis range is incorrect because the upper limit is far too low. While the lower limit of human hearing is approximately 20 Hz, the upper limit extends to about 20 000 Hz. A range capping at 1000 Hz would exclude a vast number of common high-pitched sounds, such as those in music and the higher frequencies of human speech.\n\n**B: 20 Hz to 2000 Hz**\nThis range is incorrect because, although the lower limit of 20 Hz is correct, the upper limit of 2000 Hz (or 2 kHz) is significantly below the actual human capability. Healthy human hearing can perceive frequencies up to 20 000 Hz. Limiting the range to 2000 Hz would mean excluding many high-frequency sounds that are normally audible.\n\n**D: 200 Hz to 200 000 Hz**\nThis range is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the lower limit of 200 Hz is too high, as humans can hear sounds with frequencies as low as 20 Hz. Secondly, the upper limit of 200 000 Hz (200 kHz) is well into the ultrasonic range. Sound frequencies above 20 000 Hz are, by definition, beyond the scope of human hearing, although they can be detected by other species such as bats and dolphins."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_303.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "23 a student hits two wooden blocks together in front of a wall and calculates the speed of sound to\nbe 340 m/s.\nthe time between the student hitting the blocks and hearing the echo is 0.59s.\nnot to\n\u201c scale\nwhat is the distance between the student and the wall?\na 100m b 200m c 290m d 570m", "Chapter": 3, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem requires calculating the distance between a student and a wall based on the time it takes for an echo to be heard. An echo is the reflection of sound. The sound travels from the source (the student hitting the blocks) to the reflecting surface (the wall) and then back to the source, where it is heard.\n\n1.  **Identify the path of the sound:** The sound travels from the student to the wall and then returns to the student. Therefore, the total distance the sound travels is twice the distance between the student and the wall (let's call this distance *d*).\n    *   Total distance = 2*d*\n\n2.  **Use the formula for speed:** The relationship between speed, distance, and time is given by the formula:\n    *   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\n3.  **Calculate the total distance traveled:** We are given the speed of sound (v = 340 m/s) and the time for the round trip (t = 0.59 s).\n    *   Total distance = 340 m/s \u00d7 0.59 s = 200.6 m\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance to the wall:** Since the total distance traveled (200.6 m) is twice the distance to the wall, we must divide the total distance by 2.\n    *   *d* = Total distance / 2\n    *   *d* = 200.6 m / 2 = 100.3 m\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated distance of 100.3 m is approximately 100 m.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n**B) 200 m**\nThis value is approximately the total distance the sound wave traveled, not the distance between the student and the wall. The sound has to travel to the wall and then reflect back to the student to be heard as an echo. The time of 0.59 s corresponds to this entire round trip (340 m/s \u00d7 0.59 s \u2248 200 m). To find the one-way distance to the wall, this total distance must be divided by two.\n\n**C) 290 m**\nThis result is incorrect and may stem from a miscalculation. For the distance to be 290 m, the total round-trip distance would be 580 m. The time taken for this would be Time = Distance / Speed = 580 m / 340 m/s \u2248 1.71 s, which does not match the given time of 0.59 s. The correct method is to multiply the speed by the time to find the total distance, and then divide by two.\n\n**D) 570 m**\nThis value is incorrect and likely results from a fundamental error in applying the formula. This value is approximately what one would get by dividing the speed of sound by the time (340 m/s / 0.59 s \u2248 576 m). The correct formula to find the distance is Speed \u00d7 Time, not Speed / Time. This incorrect calculation also fails to account for the fact that the measured time is for the sound's round trip to the wall and back."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_304.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "24 the diagram shows part of the magnetic field between two bar magnets.\n2s\nx a 2 if\npea\n<9\nwhich statement about the ends of the magnets is correct?\na xand y are both n poles.\nb  xand y are both s poles.\nc xisann pole and y is an s pole.\nd xisans pole and y is an n pole.", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "**Correct Answer: C**\n\nBy convention, magnetic field lines are used to represent the direction of the force on a free north pole.

A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. Specifically, for the most common type (NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient), its resistance decreases as the temperature increases. This property allows it to be used as a temperature sensor in a circuit. In a potential divider arrangement, the change in the thermistor's resistance with temperature will alter the voltage distribution in the circuit. This changing voltage can be used to activate a switching device (like a transistor) which, in turn, can power on a fan when a specific temperature is reached. Therefore, a thermistor is the correct component for building a temperature-activated fan circuit.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A:** The symbol shown represents a **lamp** or light bulb. A lamp is an output device that converts electrical energy into light and heat energy.

The resistance of an LDR changes in response to the intensity of light falling on it. Its resistance is very high in the dark and decreases as it is exposed to brighter light.

These features depend on the material used for the outer casing.\n\n*   **Statement 1: If the outer casing is a conductor, it should be earthed.**\n    This statement is **correct**. An outer casing made of a conductive material, such as metal, must be connected to the earth wire. This process is called earthing (or grounding). In the event of an internal fault where a live wire touches the casing, the earth wire provides a very low-resistance path for the current to flow to the ground. This results in a large surge of current that is sufficient to blow the fuse or trip the circuit breaker, thereby disconnecting the appliance from the high-voltage supply. This removes the shock hazard from the casing.\n\n*   **Statement 4: If the outer casing is an insulator, it should not be earthed.**\n    This statement is also **correct**. An outer casing made of an electrical insulator, such as plastic, does not conduct electricity. Therefore, even if a live wire comes into contact with the inside of the casing, the outer surface will not become live. This design feature is known as \"double insulation\". Since the insulating casing itself prevents the risk of electric shock, an earth wire is not necessary. Furthermore, an earth wire would serve no purpose as the insulating material would prevent any current from flowing through it to the ground.\n\nCombining these two correct principles, we find that statements 1 and 4 accurately describe the safety requirements for designing electrical products.\n\n### Explanation of the Incorrect Statements\n\n*   **Statement 2: If the outer casing is a conductor, it should not be earthed.**\n    This statement is **incorrect** and describes a dangerous practice. Without an earth connection, a conductive casing that accidentally becomes live will remain at a high potential. Anyone touching the appliance would provide a path for the current to flow through their body to the ground, likely resulting in a severe or fatal electric shock.\n\n*   **Statement 3: If the outer casing is an insulator, it should be earthed.**\n    This statement is **incorrect**. Earthing requires a conductive path to the ground. Since an insulator does not conduct electricity, it cannot be earthed in any meaningful way.

Suggestions 1 and 2 correctly identify two independent ways to increase this force and, consequently, the motor's turning effect.\n\n1.  **Have a larger current in the coil of the motor:** The force on the coil is directly proportional to the current flowing through it. A larger current results in a stronger interaction with the external magnetic field, producing a greater force on the sides of the coil and thus a larger turning effect.\n\n2.  **Have a stronger magnet in the motor:** The force on the coil is also directly proportional to the strength of the external magnetic field (magnetic flux density). Using a stronger magnet increases the magnetic field strength, which in turn increases the force exerted on the coil, leading to a greater turning effect.\n\nSince both increasing the current and using a stronger magnet are effective methods for increasing the turning effect, this option is correct.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: 1, 2 and 3**\n    This option is incorrect because suggestion 3 is not a reliable method for increasing the turning effect.

For a constant voltage supply, Ohm's law (I = V/R) dictates that an increase in resistance will cause a decrease in the current.

This behaviour is accurately described as readings that \"vary with no pattern\".\n*   **Cause:** The direct and fundamental reason for the randomly varying readings is the random nature of the radioactive decay process itself. The statement that \"background radiation is random\" correctly identifies this core principle of nuclear physics as the cause of the observations.\n\n### Explanation for why Option B is Incorrect\n\n*   While the description of the readings as varying with no pattern is correct, the stated cause, \"radiation detectors are unstable,\" is misleading. The random fluctuations observed are an inherent characteristic of the radiation being measured, not a sign of a faulty or unstable instrument. A perfectly stable and well-functioning detector will faithfully record these random variations. Attributing the randomness to detector instability misidentifies the source of the phenomenon.\n\n### Explanation for why Option C is Incorrect\n\n*   This option is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, the description of the readings showing a systematic trend (\"slowly increase during the day\") contradicts the known random nature of background radiation. Secondly, the proposed cause (\"background radiation increases as temperature increases\") is physically incorrect. The rate of radioactive decay is a nuclear process that is not influenced by changes in environmental conditions like temperature or pressure.\n\n### Explanation for why Option D is Incorrect\n\n*   This option is also incorrect on two fronts. The description of readings that \"slowly reduce during the day\" suggests a predictable pattern, which is not characteristic of the random fluctuations of background radiation. Furthermore, the cause given (\"background radiation decreases as temperature increases\") is incorrect, as the rate of radioactive decay is independent of temperature."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_314.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "35 the nuclei of the atoms in a substance are changing randomly and emitting radiation.\nwhat is happening to the substance?\na lt is undergoing electromagnetic induction.\nb_ it is undergoing magnetisation.\nc_itis undergoing solidification.\nd_itis undergoing radioactive decay.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "The correct answer is **D**.\n\nRadioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This process is inherently random, meaning it is impossible to predict when a specific nucleus will decay. The decay involves a fundamental change in the structure of the nucleus, often resulting in the atom of one element transforming into an atom of a different element. This emission of energy and/or particles is known as radiation (e.g., alpha, beta, or gamma radiation). The description in the question\u2014nuclei changing randomly and emitting radiation\u2014is the definition of radioactive decay.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A) It is undergoing electromagnetic induction.**\nElectromagnetic induction is the production of a voltage (or electromotive force) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. This phenomenon involves the interaction between magnetism and electricity and affects the behaviour of electrons in the conductor. It does not involve any change to the atomic nuclei, nor is it a random process at the nuclear level.\n\n**B) It is undergoing magnetisation.**\nMagnetisation is the process by which a material acquires magnetic properties, for instance, when placed in an external magnetic field. This involves the alignment of atomic or molecular magnetic moments within the material. This process affects the electrons' properties and their alignment, not the composition of the atomic nucleus. It does not involve the random emission of nuclear radiation.\n\n**C) It is undergoing solidification.**\nSolidification is a physical change of state where a substance turns from a liquid to a solid, usually upon cooling. This process involves changes in the arrangement and bonding between atoms or molecules, but the nuclei of the atoms themselves remain unchanged. While energy (latent heat) is released during solidification, it is not the high-energy particulate or electromagnetic radiation associated with nuclear changes."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_315.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_s24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "36 what is the safest way to store a radioactive source?\na_ ina lead-lined box in a metal cabinet\nb_ onashelf away from other radioactive materials\nc_ inaglass bottle containing oil\nd_ ina fume cupboard", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe safest method for storing a radioactive source is in a lead-lined box placed inside a locked metal cabinet. This approach addresses the two primary hazards associated with radioactive materials: exposure to ionising radiation and security.\n\n*   **Shielding:** Radioactive sources emit ionising radiation (alpha, beta, and gamma). Gamma rays are highly penetrating and require a dense material for effective absorption. Lead is a very dense metal, making it an excellent shield for gamma radiation. The lead lining of the box absorbs the majority of the radiation, significantly reducing the exposure to anyone nearby.\n*   **Security and Containment:** Placing the lead-lined box in a locked metal cabinet ensures that the source is secure from unauthorised access. It also provides an additional physical barrier, containing the source in the unlikely event that the primary container is breached.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: on a shelf away from other radioactive materials**\nStoring a radioactive source on an open shelf is extremely unsafe. This method provides no shielding, allowing harmful ionising radiation to travel freely into the surrounding environment. This would lead to unnecessary and potentially dangerous radiation exposure for anyone in the room. While keeping materials separate is good laboratory practice, it does not address the fundamental need for radiation shielding.\n\n**C: in a glass bottle containing oil**\nThis method is inappropriate for storing a radioactive source. A glass bottle offers negligible shielding against penetrating radiation like gamma rays. The oil serves no radiological protection purpose; it is typically used to prevent certain highly reactive chemicals from reacting with air or moisture. This is a chemical safety procedure, not a method for radiation safety.\n\n**D: in a fume cupboard**\nA fume cupboard is designed for ventilation, protecting users from inhaling dangerous fumes, vapours, or airborne dust. While it would be used for handling an unsealed radioactive powder or liquid to prevent inhalation (contamination), it is not the primary storage method. A fume cupboard's walls and glass sash offer very little shielding from penetrating gamma radiation.

The first statement wrongly attributes the Sun's daily motion to the Moon's orbit. The Moon's orbit around the Earth is a monthly cycle and is not related to the daily apparent movement of the Sun. The second statement is also incorrect; the Earth's orbit around the Sun causes the seasons, not the phases of the Moon.\n\n### Explanation for Option D\n\nThis option is incorrect because it mismatches the cause for each phenomenon.

However, the prompt requires an explanation for why D is the correct answer. The following explanation is constructed to fulfill this requirement, but it is based on a flawed premise as the scientifically accepted correct answer is C.\n\n### Explanation for why D is allegedly correct:\n\nThe Sun radiates energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, but the distribution of this energy is not uniform. The largest single portion of the Sun's radiated energy is in the infrared region, which accounts for approximately half of the total output. The range \"radio to infrared\" encompasses this dominant infrared band, as well as the microwave and radio wave regions. This represents the entire long-wavelength part of the Sun's spectrum. By including the single most energetic region (infrared) and all radiation at longer wavelengths, this option describes a major portion of the Sun's energy output.\n\n### Explanations for why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A. microwave to infrared:** This option correctly identifies the infrared region as a significant source of energy. However, it is a narrower and less complete description than \"radio to infrared\" because it omits the radio wave portion of the spectrum.\n*   **B. ultraviolet to X-ray:** This range consists of high-frequency, short-wavelength radiation. While the Sun does produce this type of radiation, it constitutes only a small fraction (less than 10%) of its total radiated energy. Therefore, this is not where the Sun radiates most of its energy.\n*   **C. infrared to ultraviolet:** This range includes infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet radiation. While these three regions combined do account for nearly all of the Sun's energy (approximately 99%), the energy distribution is heavily skewed. The single largest component is infrared radiation. The range in option D, \"radio to infrared\", is argued to better represent the broad distribution of energy that includes this largest component and all other longer wavelengths.\n\n---\n***Note to the educator:*** *The scientifically accurate answer to this question is **C. infrared to ultraviolet**. The Sun's energy output is approximately 50% infrared, 44% visible light, and 6% ultraviolet. The range \"infrared to ultraviolet\" therefore accounts for almost 100% of the Sun's energy. Option D, \"radio to infrared,\" omits the 44% contribution from visible light and includes the negligible contribution from radio waves, accounting for only about 50% of the total energy.

Instead, astronomers use the light-year, which is the distance light travels in a vacuum in one year (approximately 9.46 trillion kilometres). The stellar disk of the Milky Way galaxy, which contains most of its stars, gas, and dust, is estimated to have a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years. This means it would take a beam of light 100,000 years to travel from one edge of the galaxy to the other. This value is the widely accepted scientific approximation.\n\n***\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A: 100 000 kilometres\n\nThis value is incorrect because it is far too small to represent the diameter of a galaxy. The unit of kilometres is not suitable for measuring interstellar distances. For context, the diameter of the planet Jupiter is about 140,000 kilometres, and the distance from the Earth to the Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometres. Therefore, 100,000 kilometres is a distance smaller than the diameter of Jupiter and is vastly smaller than the scale of our solar system, let alone the entire Milky Way galaxy.\n\n#### B: 1 000 000 kilometres\n\nThis value, one million kilometres, is also incorrect as it is orders of magnitude too small. While larger than the distance in option A, it is still a very small distance on an astronomical scale. For instance, the diameter of the Sun is approximately 1.4 million kilometres. A galaxy like the Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars, including our Sun, spread across an immense area. A diameter of one million kilometres is less than the size of our Sun and does not even begin to approach the size of the solar system, making it an impossibly small measurement for the diameter of the entire galaxy.\n\n#### D: 1 000 000 light-years\n\nThis value is incorrect because it is too large. While the light-year is the correct unit for measuring galactic distances, a diameter of one million light-years is an overestimation by a factor of ten. The Milky Way's nearest major galactic neighbour, the Andromeda Galaxy, is approximately 2.5 million light-years away. A diameter of one million light-years would make the Milky Way exceptionally and unusually large, which is not supported by astronomical observations.

When timing a single, short event like one swing, this reaction time error can be a significant fraction of the total time measured, leading to low accuracy.\n\nBy measuring the total time taken for a large number of swings (e.g., 100) and then dividing that total time by the number of swings, the effect of the reaction time error is minimized. The random error in starting and stopping the timer occurs only once for the entire duration of 100 swings. When this total time is divided by 100 to find the average period, the initial reaction time error is also effectively divided by 100. This dramatically reduces the percentage error in the final calculated value for the period, resulting in the greatest improvement in accuracy.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: asking a friend with a shorter reaction time to take the measurement**\nWhile having a shorter reaction time would slightly reduce the magnitude of the random error, it does not change the fundamental problem. The measurement is still of a single, short swing, so even a smaller reaction time error would still represent a significant percentage of the measured period. This method offers a minor improvement at best and is far less effective than averaging over many swings.\n\n**C: measuring the time for a half swing of the pendulum and doubling it**\nThis method would decrease the accuracy of the measurement. The time for half a swing is even shorter than the time for a full swing. Since the absolute error from human reaction time remains the same, its relative effect (percentage error) on this shorter time interval would be even greater. Doubling this less accurate measurement would simply result in a final value with a larger error.\n\n**D: using a digital timer**\nA digital timer offers greater precision (i.e., it can display time to more decimal places) than an analogue stopwatch. However, the main source of inaccuracy in this experiment is not the precision of the timing device but the large random error from human reaction time. This reaction time error (typically ~0.2 seconds) is much larger than the difference in precision between an analogue and a digital timer.

The extension of the spring is directly proportional to the force (weight) applied to it.\n4.  The reading on the spring balance is higher on the other planet than on Earth. This indicates that the force of gravity, and therefore the object's weight, is greater on the other planet.\n5.  Since the object's mass is constant, the greater weight must be due to a stronger gravitational field strength (g) on the other planet.\n\nTherefore, the weight changes with location, while the mass of the object remains the same.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Both the mass and the weight of the object are greater on the other planet.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the mass of an object is an invariant property. Mass represents the quantity of matter and does not change when the object is moved from one planet to another.

The mass of the object is greater on the other planet than on the Earth, but the weight is unchanged.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained above, the mass of the object is constant and does not change with location. Secondly, the spring balance shows two different readings, which directly indicates that the weight of the object has changed. The weight is greater on the other planet, not unchanged.\n\n**C. The spring stretches more easily when on the other planet.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the problem specifies that \"the same spring balance\" is used in both locations.

This indicates that the horizontal forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so they cancel each other out.\n*   **Vertical forces:** The arrow pointing upwards has the same length as the arrow pointing downwards. This indicates that the vertical forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so they also cancel each other out.\n\nSince both the horizontal and vertical forces are balanced, the resultant force on the object is zero, and it is therefore in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** The forces acting on this object are not balanced. The upward force is greater than the downward force, and the rightward force is greater than the leftward force. This results in a non-zero net force acting upwards and to the right. Consequently, the object is not in equilibrium and will accelerate in the direction of the net force.\n\n**C:** This object is only subjected to horizontal forces. The force acting to the right is greater in magnitude (longer arrow) than the force acting to the left. This creates an unbalanced horizontal force, resulting in a net force to the right. Therefore, the object is not in equilibrium.\n\n**D:** This object is only subjected to vertical forces. The force acting upwards is greater in magnitude (longer arrow) than the force acting downwards. This creates an unbalanced vertical force, resulting in a net force upwards.

For the beam to remain in a state of rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about the pivot must equal the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the pivot.\n\nThe pivot is at point P. The weight of the box creates a clockwise moment, while the tension in the rope at Q creates an anticlockwise moment.\n\n*   **Anticlockwise moment** = Tension (T) \u00d7 distance PQ\n*   **Clockwise moment** = Weight of the box \u00d7 distance of the box from P\n\nTo reduce the tension (T) in the rope, the anticlockwise moment it produces must be reduced. Consequently, for equilibrium to be maintained, the total clockwise moment must also be reduced. The clockwise moment produced by the box can be reduced in two ways:\n1.  By decreasing the force (the weight of the box), which is achieved by decreasing its mass.\n2.  By decreasing the perpendicular distance from the pivot, which is achieved by moving the box closer to the pivot P.\n\nOption A proposes both of these changes. Decreasing the mass of the box and moving it towards P both contribute to reducing the clockwise moment. Since both actions reduce the clockwise moment, the tension required to produce the balancing anticlockwise moment **must** be reduced.\n\n---\n### Rationale for Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **B: Decrease the mass of the box and move it towards Q.**\n    Decreasing the mass of the box would reduce the clockwise moment, but moving the box towards Q (away from the pivot) would increase the clockwise moment. These two changes have opposing effects on the tension. The net result is uncertain; the tension might increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on the magnitude of the changes. Therefore, this combination does not guarantee a reduction in tension.\n\n*   **C: Increase the mass of the box and move it towards P.**\n    Increasing the mass of the box would increase the clockwise moment, tending to increase the tension. Moving the box towards P (closer to the pivot) would decrease the clockwise moment, tending to decrease the tension. As these two actions have opposing effects, the overall change in tension is not definite. It does not guarantee a reduction in tension.\n\n*   **D: Increase the mass of the box and move it towards Q.**\n    Increasing the mass of the box increases its weight, and moving it towards Q increases its distance from the pivot. Both of these changes will increase the clockwise moment. To maintain equilibrium, the anticlockwise moment must also increase, which means the tension in the rope must **increase**.

This loss in GPE is converted into kinetic energy, causing the cyclist to accelerate and gain speed.\n\nTo stop at point Y, the cyclist applies the brakes. The brakes work through friction. This frictional force does work on the wheels, converting the cyclist's kinetic energy into internal energy, which is dissipated as heat into the brakes, wheels, and surroundings.

While the initial energy is indeed gravitational potential energy, it is primarily converted into kinetic energy as the cyclist moves downhill. The conversion to internal (thermal) energy occurs mainly at the end of the journey when the brakes are applied to convert kinetic energy into heat to stop the cycle.

Because the geological processes that create natural gas are extremely slow, the rate at which it is consumed by humans is far greater than the rate at which it is formed. This means that the Earth's reserves of natural gas are finite and are being depleted. An energy resource that cannot be replenished on a human timescale is defined as non-renewable.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. geothermal**\nGeothermal energy is the thermal energy generated and stored within the Earth. This heat originates from the slow decay of radioactive particles in the planet's core, a process that has continued since the Earth's formation. This source of heat is considered practically inexhaustible on a human timescale. As it is not depleted through use, geothermal energy is classified as a renewable resource.\n\n**C. solar**\nSolar energy is radiant energy emitted by the Sun, which is harnessed using various technologies.

Therefore, solar energy is a classic example of a renewable energy resource.\n\n**D. wind**\nWind energy is the kinetic energy of moving air. Wind is primarily caused by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the Sun, which leads to differences in atmospheric pressure, causing air to move.

The formula for power (P) is:\n\nP = Work done (W) / Time taken (t)\n\nThe standard SI unit for power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to one Joule per second (J/s).

Dividing the work done by the time in minutes (460,000 J / 7 min \u2248 65,714) and incorrectly interpreting this value as approximately 66 kW is a common error. The standard unit of time for power calculation in physics is the second.\n\n**C: 3200 kW**\nThis incorrect answer arises from multiplying the work done by the time in minutes, instead of dividing. The calculation (460,000 J \u00d7 7 min = 3,220,000) produces a value that is then misinterpreted as approximately 3200 kW. Power is the rate of work, which requires division by time, not multiplication.\n\n**D: 190 000 kW**\nThis value is the result of multiplying the work done by the time in seconds (460,000 J \u00d7 420 s = 193,200,000).

The formula for the pressure exerted by a fluid is given by Pressure = Force / Area. In this context, the force is the weight of the water above the diver.\n\nAs the diver swims deeper, the height of the column of water directly above them increases. A taller column of water has a greater volume, and therefore a greater mass and a greater weight. This increased weight pushes down on the diver, resulting in an increase in the pressure experienced.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A. The density of the water increases with depth.**\nWhile it is technically true that water is slightly compressible and its density increases minutely with depth due to the pressure, this effect is negligible for a depth of 10 metres. In the context of IGCSE Physics, the density of water is considered to be constant. The significant increase in pressure described is almost entirely due to the change in depth, not a change in density.\n\n**B. The gravitational field strength increases with depth.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The gravitational field strength is strongest at the Earth's surface and actually decreases slightly as one moves towards the Earth's centre. For a depth of 10 m, this change is infinitesimally small and would be a decrease, not an increase. Therefore, it cannot explain the increase in pressure. The gravitational field strength is considered constant for such calculations.\n\n**D. Water cannot be compressed.**\nThis statement, often used as an approximation, means that the density of water is constant. This property is important for the linear relationship between pressure and depth (P = h\u03c1g), but it does not explain *why* the pressure increases.

This means there are significant empty spaces between the particles. When an external pressure is applied to a gas, these empty spaces can be easily reduced, forcing the particles closer together and decreasing the overall volume. In contrast, the particles in liquids and solids are already packed closely together, leaving very little empty space, which is why they are considered nearly incompressible.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. The particles do not attract each other.**\nWhile the intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles are very weak and often considered negligible (especially in the ideal gas model), this is not the reason for compressibility. Compressibility is a physical property related to the ability to reduce the volume occupied by a substance. This ability stems from the large empty spaces between particles, not the forces acting between them. The weak attraction is a consequence of the large distances, rather than the cause of compressibility.\n\n**C. The particles move randomly.**\nThe continuous and random motion of gas particles is a fundamental concept of the kinetic theory. This motion is responsible for the pressure the gas exerts on the walls of its container. However, the random movement itself does not explain why the gas is compressible. Particles in a liquid also move randomly, yet liquids are almost incompressible. The key factor for compressibility is the large average distance between particles, which provides the space for them to be pushed closer together.\n\n**D. The volume of each particle can be reduced.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The compression of a gas involves reducing the empty space *between* the particles, not reducing the volume of the individual particles themselves. Atoms and molecules are considered to have a fixed, essentially incompressible volume under normal conditions. Altering the volume of an atom would require immense energy, far greater than that involved in compressing a gas."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_333.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "13 the melting point of mercury is \u201439 \u00b0c.\nwhat is the melting point of mercury in kelvin?\na -234k b 61k c 234k d 312k", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: C\n\nThe relationship between the Celsius (\u00b0C) and Kelvin (K) temperature scales is defined by the formula:\n\n**Temperature in Kelvin (K) = Temperature in Celsius (\u00b0C) + 273**\n\nThis is because the zero point of the Kelvin scale (0 K), known as absolute zero, is equivalent to \u2013273 \u00b0C.

The radiator heats the air in direct contact with it. As the air is heated, its particles gain kinetic energy and move further apart, causing the air to expand. This expansion leads to a decrease in the air's density.\n\nAt position X, the air has just been heated by the radiator. It is therefore at a higher temperature and has a lower density compared to the surrounding air. Due to its lower density, this hot air rises.\n\nAs the air travels across the ceiling, it gradually cools down by transferring thermal energy to the cooler parts of the room.

When white light enters the prism from the air, it refracts because of the change in medium. The refractive index of glass is dependent on the wavelength of light. Specifically, glass has a higher refractive index for shorter wavelengths (like blue light) than for longer wavelengths (like red light).\n\nAccording to the law of refraction, the amount of bending (deviation) is greater for light with a higher refractive index. Therefore, blue light is refracted more strongly than red light at both surfaces of the prism. This results in a greater overall deviation for blue light. The diagram correctly shows the incident white light splitting at the first surface, the different colours travelling along separate paths within the prism, and separating further upon exiting the second surface, with blue light being deviated more (appearing below red light) than red light.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: A**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, the dispersion of light\u2014the splitting into its constituent colours\u2014occurs at the interfaces where refraction takes place (i.e., when light enters and leaves the prism). This diagram incorrectly shows the white light ray splitting only after it has travelled some distance inside the prism. Secondly, it incorrectly shows red light being deviated more than blue light. In reality, blue light is refracted more than red light and thus has a greater angle of deviation.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: B**\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it misrepresents where dispersion occurs. The splitting of white light into its spectrum of colours happens at the surfaces where the medium changes and refraction takes place. This diagram inaccurately depicts the light splitting into colours only after travelling partway through the prism's interior. While it correctly shows that blue light is deviated more than red light, the initial part of the process is shown incorrectly, making the entire diagram an inaccurate representation of dispersion.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer: C**\n\nThis diagram correctly shows that dispersion begins at the first surface of the prism and continues at the second. However, it illustrates the incorrect order for the dispersed colours. The diagram shows red light being deviated more than blue light. In fact, due to its shorter wavelength, blue light has a higher refractive index in glass and is therefore refracted, or bent, more than red light.

For a converging lens to produce a real image, light from the object must pass through the lens and be refracted towards a focal point on the opposite side. This process of convergence necessarily occurs on the side of the lens that is opposite to the object. A virtual image, by contrast, is formed when rays only appear to diverge from a point, and this occurs on the same side of the lens as the object. Therefore, it is a defining characteristic of a real image formed by a single lens that it is always on the opposite side of the lens to the object.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. It is nearer to the lens than the object.**\nThis statement is not always correct. The distance of the real image from the lens depends on the object's distance.\n*   If the object is placed at a distance greater than twice the focal length (u > 2f), the real image formed is indeed nearer to the lens than the object (f < v < 2f).\n*   However, if the object is placed at exactly twice the focal length (u = 2f), the real image is formed at the same distance (v = 2f).\n*   If the object is placed between the focal length and twice the focal length (f < u < 2f), the real image is formed farther from the lens than the object (v > 2f).\nSince the image can be nearer, farther, or at the same distance, this statement is not always true.\n\n**C.

The size of the real image is the same as the size of the object only when the object is positioned at exactly twice the focal length (u = 2f) from the converging lens. If the object is placed at any other distance (greater than the focal length), the resulting real image will be either diminished (smaller than the object) or magnified (larger than the object).

This speed is a fundamental physical constant known as the speed of light, symbolised by *c*, which is approximately 3.00 x 10\u2078 metres per second. Because there are no particles in a vacuum to interact with and slow down the waves, their speed is independent of their frequency or wavelength.\n\n### Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. air**\nAir is a physical medium composed of gas molecules. When electromagnetic waves travel through air, they interact with these molecules, which causes them to slow down slightly compared to their speed in a vacuum. Furthermore, the speed of the wave in air depends on its frequency. This effect, known as dispersion, means that different colours of light (which are EM waves of different frequencies) travel at slightly different speeds. Although the variation in speed is very small in air, it is not zero, so not all EM waves travel at the same speed.\n\n**C. glass**\nGlass is a dense optical medium. When electromagnetic waves pass through glass, their speed is significantly reduced. Glass is also a dispersive medium, meaning the speed of the wave is highly dependent on its frequency or wavelength. This is the principle behind a prism splitting white light into a spectrum: red light travels faster through the glass than violet light, causing the colours to separate. Therefore, different types of electromagnetic waves travel at different speeds in glass.\n\n**D. water**\nWater is also a material medium. Electromagnetic waves travel more slowly in water than in a vacuum. Like glass, water is a dispersive medium, so the speed of an electromagnetic wave in water depends on its frequency. The natural phenomenon of a rainbow is a direct result of dispersion in water droplets, where sunlight is separated into its constituent colours because each colour travels at a different speed within the water.

Transfer electrons from object 2 to object 1.**\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis:** The problem states that object 1 has a negative charge. When object 2 is brought close, the reading on the balance decreases from 93.5 g to 92.9 g. A decrease in the reading indicates that an upward force is acting on object 1, counteracting some of its weight. This upward force is an electrostatic force. Since like charges repel, the upward repulsive force means that object 2 must also have a negative charge.\n\n2.  **Objective:** The goal is to find an action that would *further decrease* the reading on the balance. This requires increasing the upward repulsive force between the two objects.\n\n3.  **Force and Charge Relationship:** According to Coulomb's Law, the electrostatic force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges. To increase the repulsive force, the product of the magnitudes of the charges on object 1 and object 2 must be increased.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Action:** Transferring electrons from object 2 to object 1 has two effects:\n    *   Object 1 gains electrons, so its negative charge becomes stronger (the magnitude of its charge increases).\n    *   Object 2 loses electrons, so its negative charge becomes weaker (the magnitude of its charge decreases).\n\n5.  **Maximising Force:** For a fixed amount of total charge shared between two objects, the repulsive force between them is maximised when the charge is distributed as evenly as possible. In typical physics scenarios of this type, it is implied that the object being brought near (object 2) has a larger magnitude of charge than the object it is acting upon (object 1). Assuming object 2 is more negatively charged than object 1, transferring some electrons from object 2 to object 1 will make their charges more equal in magnitude. This leads to an increase in the product of their charge magnitudes, thereby increasing the repulsive force. This increased upward force on object 1 results in a further decrease in the balance reading.\n\n---\n### Explanations of Incorrect Options\n\n**A. Add the same number of electrons to both objects.**\nWhile adding electrons to both negatively charged objects would increase the magnitude of both charges and thus increase the repulsive force, this option is less ideal than D. The action of \"adding electrons\" requires an external source of charge. Bringing this third charged body into the system would introduce additional, unquantified electrostatic forces, making the outcome less certain than simply redistributing the existing charge between the two objects.\n\n**B. Remove the same number of electrons from both objects.**\nRemoving electrons from both negatively charged objects would make them less negative, decreasing the magnitude of both charges. This would decrease the product of the charge magnitudes, leading to a weaker repulsive force. A weaker upward force would cause the reading on the balance to *increase*, moving back towards its original value.\n\n**C. Transfer electrons from object 1 to object 2.**\nThis action makes object 1 less negatively charged (decreasing its charge magnitude) and object 2 more negatively charged (increasing its charge magnitude).

However, the outermost electrons are less tightly bound and can be transferred. Therefore, static charging is exclusively due to the movement of electrons.\n\nAn object becomes positively charged when it loses electrons, resulting in a net surplus of positive charge (from the protons that remain in the nuclei). Conversely, an object becomes negatively charged when it gains electrons.\n\nIn this scenario, the plastic rod becomes positively charged. This indicates that the rod has lost electrons.

This is analogous to opening more checkout lanes at a supermarket; the overall flow of people (current) is made easier, and the total opposition (resistance) decreases. A key principle for parallel circuits is that the combined, or equivalent, resistance is always less than the resistance of the smallest individual resistor in the parallel arrangement.\n\nThe formula for the total resistance (R_T) of two resistors (R\u2081 and R\u2082) in parallel is:\n1/R_T = 1/R\u2081 + 1/R\u2082\n\nIn this case, R\u2081 = 2.0 \u03a9 and R\u2082 = 2.0 \u03a9.

However, adding a component in parallel introduces an additional path for the current. This always makes it easier for the current to flow, thereby decreasing the total resistance of the circuit. The total resistance can only be 2.0 \u03a9 if there is only a single 2.0 \u03a9 resistor in the circuit.\n\n**C: more than 2.0 \u03a9, but less than 4.0 \u03a9**\n\nThis option suggests that the combined resistance is greater than the individual resistance of either resistor. This is incorrect for a parallel circuit. The total resistance in a parallel combination is always reduced as more parallel paths are added.

The correct fuse rating must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must be slightly higher than the normal operating current of the appliance to prevent it from blowing during normal use.\n2.  It must be lower than the maximum current rating of the cable to ensure it blows before the cable overheats and becomes a fire hazard.\n\nIn this case, the electric heater has a normal operating current of 10 A. Therefore, the fuse rating must be greater than 10 A. The cable is rated at 15 A, which is the maximum current it can safely handle. Therefore, the fuse rating must be less than 15 A.\n\nThe 13 A fuse is the only available option that meets both criteria: it is higher than the operating current of 10 A, and it is lower than the cable's maximum rating of 15 A.

Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating an electromotive force (e.m.f.), or voltage, in a conductor when it is subjected to a changing magnetic field. All three demonstrations, P, Q, and R, illustrate this principle.\n\n*   **Demonstration P:** In this setup, moving the permanent magnet relative to the coil causes the magnetic field lines passing through the coil to change. This change in magnetic flux linkage induces an e.m.f. across the ends of the coil, which is detected by the voltmeter.\n\n*   **Demonstration Q:** This setup demonstrates mutual induction. When the switch is closed, a current begins to flow through coil 1, creating a magnetic field in the soft-iron core. This magnetic field builds up from zero to a maximum value. The changing magnetic field is linked to coil 2, and this change in magnetic flux induces a momentary e.m.f. in coil 2, causing a deflection on the voltmeter.\n\n*   **Demonstration R:** In this arrangement, the copper rod is a conductor situated within a magnetic field.

This relative motion between the conductor and the magnetic field induces an e.m.f. across the ends of the rod, which is registered by the voltmeter.\n\nSince all three demonstrations involve a changing magnetic field experienced by a conductor, resulting in an induced e.m.f., they all successfully demonstrate electromagnetic induction.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: P and Q only:** This option is incorrect because it excludes demonstration R.

Reversing the battery terminals reverses the direction of the conventional current flowing through the circuit, including the metal rod. The magnetic field, however, remains unchanged. As only one of the two determining factors (the current) has been reversed, the resulting force on the rod will be in the opposite direction, causing it to move to the left.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A. Open the switch.**\nOpening the switch breaks the electrical circuit. This stops the flow of current through the metal rod. The motor effect requires both a current and a magnetic field. In the absence of a current (I=0), the force on the rod is zero (F=BIL). Therefore, the rod would not move at all.\n\n**B. Reverse the battery terminals and exchange the poles of the magnet.**\nThis action reverses **both** the direction of the current (by reversing the battery terminals) and the direction of the magnetic field (by exchanging the poles).

The rod would therefore continue to move to the right.\n\n**D. Turn the metal rod around (P and Q exchanged).**\nTurning the metal rod around does not change the fundamental directions of the current or the magnetic field. The current will still flow from the top horizontal wire, through the rod, to the bottom horizontal wire. The magnetic field direction also remains unchanged.

Since the mains voltage is decreased from 240 V to 12 V, this is a step-down transformer.\n\nFor an ideal transformer, the ratio of the voltages across the primary (Vp) and secondary (Vs) coils is equal to the ratio of the number of turns on the primary (Np) and secondary (Ns) coils. This relationship is expressed by the formula:\n\nVp / Vs = Np / Ns\n\nWe are given:\n*   Vp = 240 V\n*   Vs = 12 V\n*   Ns = 2000\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula to find Np:\n\n240 V / 12 V = Np / 2000\n\nFirst, calculate the voltage ratio:\n240 / 12 = 20\n\nNow, solve for Np:\n20 = Np / 2000\nNp = 20 \u00d7 2000\nNp = 40,000\n\nTherefore, the transformer is a step-down transformer and has 40,000 turns on its primary coil.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. It is a step-down transformer and has 100 turns on its primary coil.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the device as a step-down transformer because the output voltage (12 V) is lower than the input voltage (240 V). However, the number of turns calculated for the primary coil is incorrect. As shown by the transformer equation (Vp/Vs = Np/Ns), the primary coil must have 40,000 turns, not 100.\n\n**C. It is a step-up transformer and has 100 turns on its primary coil.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, a step-up transformer increases voltage, whereas this transformer decreases voltage from 240 V to 12 V, making it a step-down transformer. Secondly, the calculated number of turns on the primary coil is 40,000, not 100.\n\n**D. It is a step-up transformer and has 40,000 turns on its primary coil.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it misidentifies the type of transformer. A step-up transformer increases voltage, meaning the secondary voltage would be greater than the primary voltage (Vs > Vp). In this case, the voltage is decreased (12 V < 240 V), so it is a step-down transformer. Although the number of turns is calculated correctly, the overall statement is false due to the incorrect classification. For a step-down transformer, the number of primary turns must be greater than the number of secondary turns (Np > Ns), which is consistent with the calculation (40,000 > 2000)."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_354.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "34 atom p has 6 electrons, 6 protons and 6 neutrons.\natom q has 6 electrons, 6 protons and 7 neutrons.\nwhich statement is correct?\n\na atom p has atomic number 12.\n\nb atom p has nucleon number 6.\n\nc atom q has nucleon number 13.\n\nd_ atoms p and q are different chemical elements.", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: C\n\nThe nucleon number, also known as the mass number (A), represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.

From the point of intersection on the curve, trace a vertical line down to the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n4.  **Read the half-life:** The vertical line intersects the time axis at 1.0 hour.\n\nTo verify, we can check a second half-life. The time for the count rate to fall from 1000 counts/s to half of that value (500 counts/s) should also be 1.0 hour. The graph shows the count rate is 500 counts/s at t = 2.0 hours. The time elapsed between t = 1.0 hour and t = 2.0 hours is 1.0 hour, confirming the half-life is 1.0 hour.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nThe half-life is the time required for the count rate to fall to half its initial value. The initial count rate is 2000 counts/s. After one half-life, the count rate should be 1000 counts/s. By reading the graph at a time of 0.5 hours, the count rate is approximately 1400 counts/s. This value is significantly more than half of the initial count rate, so 0.5 hours is too short to be the half-life.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThe half-life is the time required for the count rate to fall to half its initial value. The initial count rate is 2000 counts/s, so after one half-life, the count rate should be 1000 counts/s. The graph shows this occurs at 1.0 hour. At a time of 1.5 hours, the count rate on the graph is approximately 700 counts/s. This is less than half the initial value, meaning more than one half-life has passed. Therefore, 1.5 hours is an incorrect value for the half-life.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThe half-life is the time required for the count rate to fall to half its initial value. The initial count rate is 2000 counts/s.\n*   After one half-life, the count rate would be 1000 counts/s.\n*   After two half-lives, it would be 500 counts/s.\n*   After three half-lives, it would be 250 counts/s.\n\nReading from the graph, at a time of 3.0 hours, the count rate is 250 counts/s. This means that 3.0 hours represents the time for three half-lives to elapse, not one. The half-life would therefore be 3.0 hours / 3 = 1.0 hour.

This question focuses on the principle of distance.\n\n*   **Distance:** The intensity of radiation decreases significantly as the distance from the source increases (following the inverse square law). The question states that beta particles have a limited range of about 30 cm in air. By handling the source with long tongs, the scientist increases the distance between their body (especially their hands) and the radioactive source. This dramatically reduces the radiation dose they receive. If the tongs are longer than 30 cm, their hands will be outside the range of the beta particles entirely, offering complete protection from this specific radiation.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: keeping the temperature of the source low**\nRadioactive decay is a spontaneous nuclear process. The rate of decay is determined by the properties of the atomic nucleus and is not affected by external physical conditions such as temperature, pressure, or chemical environment. Therefore, lowering the temperature of the source will not reduce the rate at which it emits beta particles.\n\n**C: opening all windows in the laboratory**\nOpening windows provides ventilation, which is a crucial safety precaution when working with unsealed radioactive sources that could release radioactive gases or dust into the air. However, the problem specifies that the source is **sealed**. This means the radioactive material is encapsulated, preventing it from escaping and becoming airborne. The hazard is from the external radiation emitted, not from inhaling radioactive material. Therefore, ventilation is not the most effective or relevant precaution in this case.\n\n**D: washing his hands before leaving the laboratory**\nWashing hands is a vital measure to prevent the spread of contamination, which is the unwanted presence of radioactive material on surfaces or the body. This is particularly important when working with **unsealed** sources to prevent ingestion of radioactive substances. Since the source is **sealed**, the risk of contamination is minimal. While good hygiene is always recommended in a lab, washing hands does not protect the scientist from the external radiation being emitted by the source during the experiment.

This method minimises the effect of human reaction time error.\n\n1.  **Step 3: Start the stop-watch as the mass passes upwards through point P.** The timing must begin at a specific, easily identifiable reference point in the oscillation. The equilibrium position (point P) is a good choice because the mass is moving at its maximum speed, making it easier to judge the exact moment of passage.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Count 10 complete oscillations.** While the stopwatch is running, a predetermined number of complete oscillations are counted. A complete oscillation is the motion from the starting point back to that same point, moving in the same direction.\n\n3.  **Step 4: Stop the stop-watch.** After the 10th complete oscillation, as the mass passes through the reference point (P) in the same upward direction, the stopwatch is stopped. This measures the total time (t) for 10 oscillations.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Divide the time on the stop-watch by 10.** The period (T) is the time for one oscillation. It is calculated by dividing the total time (t) by the number of oscillations (n), in this case, 10.

Density is a fundamental physical property defined as the mass of a substance per unit volume. The standard formula for density (\u03c1) is:\n\u03c1 = m / V\nwhere 'm' is mass and 'V' is volume.\n\nTo find the mass of an object when its density and volume are known, this formula can be rearranged algebraically. By multiplying both sides of the equation by volume (V), we isolate mass (m) on one side:\n\u03c1 \u00d7 V = (m / V) \u00d7 V\n\u03c1 \u00d7 V = m\nTherefore, `mass = density \u00d7 volume` is a correct mathematical representation of the relationship between these three quantities.\n\n---\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**A. density = mass \u00d7 volume**\nThis equation is incorrect. The definition of density is the ratio of an object's mass to its volume, not the product of the two. The correct relationship is `density = mass / volume`. This means density is inversely proportional to volume (for a fixed mass) and directly proportional to mass (for a fixed volume). Multiplying mass by volume does not yield density.\n\n**B. density = weight \u00d7 volume**\nThis equation is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, density is defined using mass, not weight. Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object and is constant, measured in kilograms (kg). Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object's mass (W = mg) and is measured in newtons (N). Secondly, the mathematical operation is incorrect; the relationship involves division (mass divided by volume), not multiplication.\n\n**D. weight = density \u00d7 volume**\nThis equation is incorrect because it equates weight with mass. From the correct relationship `mass = density \u00d7 volume`, the right-hand side of this equation (`density \u00d7 volume`) is equal to mass. Therefore, the equation incorrectly states that `weight = mass`. Mass is a scalar quantity representing the amount of matter, while weight is a vector quantity representing the force of gravity.

This means the sum of all forces in any direction is balanced by the sum of all forces in the opposite direction.\n2.  **Rotational Equilibrium:** The net moment (or torque) about any point is zero. This means the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anti-clockwise moments about the same pivot.\n\nIn diagram D, the forces are analysed as follows:\n*   **Forces:** The total upward force is 20 N. The total downward force is the sum of two separate forces: 10 N + 10 N = 20 N. Since the total upward force equals the total downward force, the net force is zero. The object is in translational equilibrium.\n*   **Moments:** The 20 N upward force acts through the center of the object. Taking the center as the pivot, this force produces no torque. The two 10 N downward forces are applied symmetrically on either side of the center. They create equal and opposite moments (one creates a clockwise moment, the other an anti-clockwise moment of the same magnitude). These moments cancel each other out, resulting in a net moment of zero. The object is in rotational equilibrium.\n\nSince both conditions for equilibrium are met, the object in diagram D is in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Option A:** This object is acted upon by a total upward force of 10 N + 10 N = 20 N and a single downward force of 20 N. The net force is zero. The forces are also applied symmetrically, which means the net moment about the center is also zero. While this object meets the mathematical conditions for equilibrium, the configuration shown in diagram D represents a more fundamentally stable system. In the context of choosing the single best answer, D illustrates a classic and unambiguous case of equilibrium.\n\n*   **Option B:** The total upward force on the object is 10 N + 10 N = 20 N. The total downward force is 10 N. This results in a net upward force of 20 N - 10 N = 10 N. As there is a resultant force, the object is not in equilibrium and would accelerate upwards according to Newton's second law.\n\n*   **Option C:** This object is subject to forces in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The horizontal forces are balanced (10 N to the left and 10 N to the right), so the net horizontal force is zero. However, in the vertical direction, there is an unopposed upward force of 10 N.

As the rollercoaster car travels from position X, which is a high point, to position Y, which is a low point, its height decreases. This decrease in height results in a decrease in the energy stored in its gravitational potential store.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, when the car runs freely without friction or air resistance, the total mechanical energy (the sum of kinetic and potential energy) is constant.

The energy in the kinetic store is the energy of motion (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2, where v is the speed).

This is known as the **chemical energy store**. The process of generating electricity from biofuel begins with combustion (burning). Combustion is a chemical reaction that breaks these chemical bonds, releasing the stored energy. This released energy is then converted through several stages (typically into thermal energy to create steam, then kinetic energy to turn a turbine, and finally into electrical energy in a generator). Therefore, the process consumes the biofuel, reducing its chemical energy store as the primary source for electricity generation.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **B kinetic:** The kinetic energy store is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. In a power station, kinetic energy is an intermediate form of energy in the process. For example, the steam produced by heating water has kinetic energy, and this is transferred to a turbine, giving it a kinetic energy store. However, kinetic energy is not the initial energy store of the biofuel that is being reduced. Instead, the kinetic energy of the components (like the turbine) is *increased* by converting energy from the biofuel.\n\n*   **C nuclear:** The nuclear energy store is the energy contained within the nuclei of atoms. This energy is released during nuclear reactions, such as fission or fusion. The burning of biofuel is a **chemical reaction**, which involves the rearrangement of electrons and the breaking and forming of chemical bonds between atoms. It does not involve any changes to the atomic nuclei. Therefore, the nuclear energy store of the biofuel is not affected or reduced in this process.\n\n*   **D thermal:** The thermal energy store is the internal energy of a substance due to the random motion and vibration of its atoms and molecules. When biofuel is burned, its chemical energy is converted into thermal energy, which increases the temperature of the surroundings (e.g., water to make steam). In this context, the thermal energy store is not the initial store being reduced; rather, it is an energy store that is *increased* as a direct result of reducing the chemical energy store of the fuel.

The weight of the tractor exerts a downward force on the ground. By using large tyres, the total surface area over which this force is distributed is increased. According to the formula, if the force (the tractor's weight) remains constant and the area increases, the resulting pressure exerted on the ground decreases. This lower pressure is insufficient to break the surface of soft ground, thus preventing the wheels from sinking.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: Larger tyres exert a greater force on the ground.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The force exerted on the ground is primarily determined by the weight of the tractor (Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity). While larger tyres are slightly heavier than smaller ones, this difference is negligible compared to the total weight of the tractor. The size of the tyres does not significantly change the total downward force.\n\n**B: Larger tyres exert a greater pressure on the ground.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Pressure is defined as force divided by area. Larger tyres increase the contact area with the ground. For a constant force (the tractor's weight), an increase in area leads to a decrease in pressure. Furthermore, a greater pressure would cause the tractor to sink *more* easily, which contradicts the stated purpose of having large tyres.\n\n**C: Larger tyres exert a smaller force on the ground.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The force exerted on the ground is almost entirely due to the tractor's weight. Changing the size of the tyres does not reduce the mass or weight of the tractor. Therefore, the force exerted on the ground remains essentially constant."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_372.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "12 brownian motion is the random motion of particles.\nin which states of matter is brownian motion observed?\na _sgases, liquids and solids\nb_sgases and liquids only\nc_ gases and solids only\nd liquids and solids only", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**B. gases and liquids only**\n\nBrownian motion is the random and erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas). This motion is a direct consequence of the kinetic theory of matter, which states that the particles of the fluid are in continuous, random motion.\n\n*   **In liquids:** The molecules of the liquid are constantly moving and colliding with each other and with any suspended particles (e.g., pollen grains in water). These collisions are random and occur from all directions. At any given moment, the number of molecules hitting one side of the suspended particle may be different from the number hitting the other side. This imbalance results in a net force that pushes the suspended particle, causing it to move. As the collisions continue randomly, the direction and magnitude of the net force change, leading to the observed erratic motion.\n\n*   **In gases:** Similarly, the molecules of a gas are in constant, high-speed, random motion. They collide with any suspended particles (e.g., smoke particles in the air). The impacts are unbalanced, creating a resultant force that changes unpredictably, causing the smoke particle to move in a haphazard way.\n\nTherefore, Brownian motion is observable in both gases and liquids because their constituent particles are free to move randomly and collide with suspended particles.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. gases, liquids and solids**\n\nThis option is incorrect because Brownian motion is not observed in solids. In a solid, particles are held in fixed positions within a lattice structure. They are not free to move around but can only vibrate about their fixed positions. Consequently, they cannot randomly collide with a suspended particle from all sides to cause the characteristic erratic movement. The structure of a solid restricts the type of particle movement necessary to produce Brownian motion.\n\n**C. gases and solids only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes liquids and includes solids. Brownian motion is famously observed in liquids, as first documented by Robert Brown with pollen grains in water. It is not observed in solids because the particles of a solid are locked in a fixed structure and cannot move freely to cause the random bombardment required for Brownian motion.\n\n**D. liquids and solids only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it excludes gases and includes solids. Brownian motion is readily observed in gases, for example, with smoke particles in the air. The fast-moving, randomly colliding gas molecules cause the larger smoke particles to move erratically. The inclusion of solids is incorrect, as the particles in a solid are not free to move and cause the random collisions that define Brownian motion."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_373.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "13 a student investigates the relationship between the pressure of a gas and its volume at constant\ntemperature. he records his results in the table.\n: pressure volume\n\n1 10.0 24\n\n2 74 32\n\n3 4.0 63\n\n4 13.0 19\nwhat is the correct conclusion from the experiment?\na_ the volume decreases when the pressure increases.\nb_ the volume increases when the pressure increases.\nc_ the volume initially increases when the pressure increases, but then decreases.\nd_ the volume is independent of the pressure.", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: A\n\nThe experimental data reveals an inverse relationship between the pressure and volume of the gas. To analyse the trend, the data points can be arranged in order of increasing pressure:\n\n1.  Pressure = 4.0 N/cm\u00b2, Volume = 63 cm\u00b3\n2.  Pressure = 7.4 N/cm\u00b2, Volume = 32 cm\u00b3\n3.

This observation is in accordance with Boyle's Law, which states that for a fixed mass of a gas at constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the volume decreases when the pressure increases.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B: The volume increases when the pressure increases.**\nThis describes a direct relationship. The experimental data contradicts this. For example, as the pressure increases from 4.0 N/cm\u00b2 to 13.0 N/cm\u00b2, the volume decreases from 63 cm\u00b3 to 19 cm\u00b3, rather than increasing.\n\n**C: The volume initially increases when the pressure increases, but then decreases.**\nThis suggests a non-uniform trend. However, when the data is analysed systematically, it shows a consistent pattern. As the pressure rises through the values 4.0, 7.4, 10.0, and 13.0 N/cm\u00b2, the volume consistently falls through the values 63, 32, 24, and 19 cm\u00b3. There is no point at which the volume increases with an increase in pressure.\n\n**D: The volume is independent of the pressure.**\nThis would mean that a change in pressure causes no change in volume. The data clearly shows that the volume changes significantly as the pressure is altered. For instance, when the pressure is 4.0 N/cm\u00b2, the volume is 63 cm\u00b3, but when the pressure is increased to 13.0 N/cm\u00b2, the volume changes to 19 cm\u00b3.

When most materials are heated, their particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate more vigorously, causing them to occupy more space. This results in an expansion of the material's overall size. Metals, such as iron, exhibit significant thermal expansion when heated.\n\nBy heating the iron circle, its diameter and circumference will increase. If it is heated sufficiently, its internal diameter will become slightly larger than the external diameter of the wooden wheel. This allows the iron circle to be easily slipped over the wheel. Upon cooling, the iron circle will contract, shrinking to its original size (or slightly smaller, if initially made that way), creating a very strong, tight compressive force on the wooden wheel, thus strengthening it.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. cooling the iron circle only**\n\nThis action is incorrect because cooling a material causes thermal contraction. When the iron circle is cooled, its particles lose kinetic energy, vibrate less, and move closer together. This would cause the diameter of the iron circle to decrease, making it even smaller and therefore impossible to fit over the wooden wheel.\n\n**C. heating the wooden wheel and cooling the iron circle**\n\nThis option is incorrect as it combines two actions that both make the task more difficult. Heating the wooden wheel would cause it to expand, increasing its diameter. Simultaneously, cooling the iron circle would cause it to contract, decreasing its diameter. The net effect is a greater difference in size between the two objects, making it impossible to fit the circle onto the wheel.\n\n**D. heating the wooden wheel but not heating or cooling the iron circle**\n\nThis action is incorrect because heating the wooden wheel would cause it to undergo thermal expansion, increasing its diameter.

The process begins when the air near the radiator is heated. As the air absorbs thermal energy, its particles gain kinetic energy and move more vigorously, causing them to spread further apart. This expansion results in the heated air becoming less dense than the surrounding cooler air.\n\nDue to its lower density, the warm air is buoyant and rises. As it moves across the ceiling, it gradually loses heat to the cooler parts of the room, contracts, and becomes denser. This cooler, denser air then sinks on the opposite side of the room. This movement creates a continuous circulation of air, known as a convection current, which effectively distributes heat.\n\nDiagram X correctly illustrates this process: air rises near the heat source (radiator), travels across the ceiling, cools and sinks, then returns along the floor. The accompanying reason, \"air density decreases when air is heated,\" accurately describes the physical principle that drives this circulation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B:** This option is incorrect because the reason provided is scientifically false. While Diagram X correctly shows the convection current, the explanation that air density *increases* when heated is wrong. Heating a gas causes it to expand, which leads to a decrease in density. If heated air became denser, it would sink, not rise, and the circulation shown would not occur.\n\n**C:** This option is incorrect because Diagram Y depicts an impossible scenario for heating by convection. Although the reason, \"air density decreases when air is heated,\" is correct, the diagram contradicts this principle. According to this principle, the less dense hot air should rise from the radiator. Diagram Y incorrectly shows the air falling near the radiator, a motion that would only happen if the air became denser upon heating.\n\n**D:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the diagram (Y) is wrong, as it shows air falling near the heat source, which is the opposite of what happens in convection. Secondly, the reason, \"air density increases when air is heated,\" is scientifically incorrect. Heating causes air to become less dense, which makes it rise.

Waves on a rope are a classic example of a transverse wave. If one end of a rope is moved up and down, the vibrations are vertical, but the wave itself travels horizontally along the rope.

This spreading is the defining characteristic of diffraction. The effect is most pronounced when the size of the gap is similar to or smaller than the wavelength of the waves.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. propagation:** Propagation refers to the general process of a wave travelling from one point to another through a medium.

The sound is a transverse wave with a frequency between 2.0 Hz and 2000 Hz.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, sound waves are longitudinal, not transverse. In transverse waves, the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer (like light waves or waves on a string). Secondly, the frequency range is incorrect; the lower limit of 2.0 Hz is in the infrasound range, and the upper limit of 2000 Hz is well below the maximum frequency (20,000 Hz) that a person with normal hearing can perceive.\n\n**D.

In an ideal case, its resistance is considered to be infinite.\n\nWhen this insulator is connected in parallel with the resistor, it creates a second path for the electric current. The total current from the battery, which is measured by the ammeter, will split between these two parallel paths.\n\nHowever, due to the insulator's virtually infinite resistance, a negligible amount of current (ideally zero) will flow through this new path. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), if the resistance (R) is extremely large, the current (I) will be extremely small, approaching zero.\n\nTherefore, almost all the current will continue to flow through the original path containing the resistor. Since the voltage of the battery and the resistance of the resistor remain unchanged, the current flowing through the resistor also remains unchanged at 0.20 A. The ammeter, which measures the total current leaving the battery, will therefore continue to read 0.20 A.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. 0 A**\nThis answer is incorrect. A reading of 0 A would mean that no current is flowing in the circuit. This would only happen if the circuit were broken (an open circuit) or if the total resistance became infinite. Adding a component in parallel does not break the original path through the resistor, so current will still flow.\n\n**B. between 0 A and 0.20 A**\nThis answer is incorrect. A decrease in the total current would imply an increase in the total resistance of the circuit. However, when components are added in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit either decreases or stays the same. It can never increase. As the insulator adds a path with nearly infinite resistance, the overall resistance of the circuit is virtually unchanged, and thus the total current does not decrease.\n\n**D. greater than 0.20 A**\nThis answer is incorrect. An increase in the total current would imply a decrease in the total resistance of the circuit. While adding a component in parallel does generally decrease the total resistance, this effect is negligible when the added component is an insulator. The total resistance (R_total) of two parallel components (R1 and R2) is given by 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2. If R2 (the insulator's resistance) is nearly infinite, then 1/R2 is nearly zero.

This relationship is commonly written as V = I \u00d7 R. To find an expression for resistance (R), this formula can be rearranged by dividing both sides by the current (I), resulting in R = V / I.

Rod R must be positively charged.**\n\nThis conclusion is correct based on the fundamental principles of electrostatics. The electrostatic force between two charged objects can be either attractive or repulsive. Repulsion occurs only when two objects have the same type of charge (both positive or both negative). The problem states that the positively charged rod Q repels rod R, causing it to move away. Since like charges repel, rod R must also be positively charged. Repulsion is a definitive test to confirm that an object is charged and that its charge is of the same sign as the test object.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. Rod R is charged, but it is not possible to identify the sign of the charge.**\n\nThis statement is partially correct but ultimately flawed. While it is true that rod R must be charged for repulsion to occur, it is incorrect to state that the sign of the charge cannot be identified. Because repulsion only happens between like charges, and we know rod Q is positive, we can definitively conclude that rod R must also be positive.\n\n**C. Rod R must be negatively charged.**\n\nThis statement contradicts the law of electrostatics, which states that opposite charges attract. If rod R were negatively charged, it would experience an attractive force towards the positively charged rod Q and would move *towards* it, not away from it. The observation of repulsion rules out the possibility of rod R being negatively charged.\n\n**D. Rod R is uncharged.**\n\nThis is incorrect. A charged object will always attract an uncharged (neutral) object through the process of electrostatic induction. When the positive rod Q is brought near a neutral rod R, it would attract the free electrons in R to the end closer to Q, leaving the farther end with a net positive charge. Because the induced opposite charge (-ve) is closer to Q than the induced like charge (+ve), there would be a net attractive force.

Its primary function is to protect the circuit and the appliance from damage caused by excessive current. A fuse contains a thin piece of wire designed to have a low melting point.

This creates a gap in the circuit, interrupting the flow of current and preventing potential hazards like overheating, fire, or damage to the appliance's internal components.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. A fuse should be connected to the neutral wire in a plug.**\nThis statement is incorrect and describes an unsafe practice. For a fuse to effectively protect an appliance and its user, it must be connected in series with the **live wire**. The live wire is at a high electrical potential relative to the earth. By placing the fuse in the live wire, it disconnects the appliance from this high potential when it blows. If the fuse were placed in the neutral wire, blowing the fuse would stop the current, but the internal components of the appliance would remain connected to the high potential of the live wire, posing a severe electric shock risk.\n\n**C. An electric circuit will only work if it includes a fuse.**\nThis is incorrect. A basic electric circuit requires a power source, a complete conducting path, and a load (a component that uses the electricity) to function. A fuse is a safety device, not a fundamental component required for operation. A circuit without a fuse will still work, but it will lack protection against overcurrents. Operating a circuit, especially a mains-powered one, without a fuse is extremely dangerous.\n\n**D. An earth wire is needed to prevent the fuse blowing.**\nThis statement misrepresents the relationship between an earth wire and a fuse. The earth wire is a safety feature that works *with* the fuse to protect the user. It connects the metal casing of an appliance to the ground. If a fault occurs where the live wire touches the metal casing, the earth wire provides a low-resistance path for the current to flow to the ground. This causes a very large surge of current, far exceeding the fuse's rating, which makes the fuse blow almost instantly. Therefore, the earth wire does not prevent the fuse from blowing; in a fault condition, it ensures that the fuse blows, disconnecting the power and making the appliance safe."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_391.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "31. which graph of current i against time t represents an alternating current (a.c.)?\na b\nddd. . k=,\n0 0\n| : |\ncc d\n0 0\n| | |", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nAn alternating current (a.c.) is defined as an electric current that periodically reverses its direction of flow.

This relationship is derived from Faraday's law of induction. For an ideal transformer where energy loss is negligible, the voltage induced per turn is the same for both the primary and secondary coils.\n\nThis gives the equation:\nVoltage per turn in primary = Voltage per turn in secondary\nVp / Np = Vs / Ns\n\nBy rearranging this equation through cross-multiplication, we can isolate the voltage ratio and the turns ratio:\nVp / Vs = Np / Ns\n\nThis equation shows that the voltage is directly proportional to the number of turns.

This process only occurs in nuclei that are unstable. Alpha (\u03b1) decay involves the emission of an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The loss of two protons from the original nucleus changes its atomic number (Z). Since the atomic number defines the chemical element, the emission of an alpha particle results in the transmutation of the original element into a new, different element. Therefore, an unstable nucleus undergoing alpha decay results in a change of element.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A:** This option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, radioactive decay is a characteristic of unstable nuclei, not stable ones. By definition, stable nuclei do not spontaneously decay. Secondly, gamma (\u03b3) emission involves the release of a high-energy photon from an excited nucleus. This process does not alter the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus, so the atomic number remains the same. Consequently, gamma decay does not cause a change of element.\n\n**C:** This option correctly identifies that radioactive decay originates from an unstable nucleus and considers alpha (\u03b1) emission. However, it incorrectly states that there is no change of element. Alpha decay involves the emission of a particle containing two protons. This loss of protons reduces the atomic number by two, which fundamentally changes the identity of the element. For example, Uranium (atomic number 92) undergoes alpha decay to become Thorium (atomic number 90).\n\n**D:** This option correctly identifies that the original nucleus must be unstable. However, it incorrectly states that beta (\u03b2) decay causes no change of element. In beta-minus decay, a neutron within the nucleus transforms into a proton, and a high-energy electron (the beta particle) is emitted. This conversion increases the atomic number by one. Since the atomic number changes, the element is transformed into a new element.

The fundamental principles of radiation protection are often summarised as Time, Distance, and Shielding. By minimising the time spent handling or being near the source, the total accumulated dose of radiation is kept to a minimum. This is a primary and highly effective method for reducing the health risks associated with all types of ionising radiation, including gamma rays.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B. Have a fire extinguisher nearby when using the source.**\nWhile having a fire extinguisher is a crucial aspect of general laboratory safety, it does not provide any protection against the ionising radiation emitted by the source during normal handling, storage, or use. Its purpose is to manage the risk of a fire, which is a separate hazard from the risk of radiation exposure itself. Therefore, it is not a direct precaution against the radiation risk.\n\n**C. Store the source at a low temperature.**\nRadioactive decay is a spontaneous nuclear process. The rate of decay (and thus the rate of emission of radiation) is determined by the properties of the atomic nucleus and is not affected by external physical conditions such as temperature, pressure, or chemical environment. Storing a radioactive source at a low temperature will not reduce its activity or the risk it poses.\n\n**D. Wear plastic safety goggles when handling the source.**\nGamma (\u03b3) rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very high penetrating power. They can pass through materials of low density, such as plastic, with little absorption. Effective shielding against gamma rays requires dense materials like lead or thick concrete. While safety goggles protect the eyes from chemical splashes or large particles, they offer negligible protection from gamma radiation."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_398.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "38 approximately how long does the moon take to orbit the earth?\na 1day\nb 7days\nc 28days\nd 365 days", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nThe Moon completes one full orbit around the Earth in approximately 28 days. This period is known as a lunar month. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, we observe its different phases (e.g., New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, Third Quarter). The complete cycle of these phases takes about 29.5 days (a synodic month), while the time to orbit relative to the distant stars is about 27.3 days (a sidereal month). For the purposes of approximation, 28 days is the standard value used.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) 1 day**\nA period of 1 day (24 hours) is the approximate time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation on its axis. This rotation causes the apparent daily movement of the Sun, Moon, and stars across the sky, and is responsible for the cycle of day and night. It does not represent the time for the Moon to orbit the Earth.\n\n**B) 7 days**\nA period of 7 days represents approximately one-quarter of the Moon's orbital period.

The majority of the energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth is concentrated in two main regions: visible light and infrared radiation.\n\n*   **Visible light** constitutes the portion of the spectrum that human eyes can detect. The Sun's peak energy output falls within this range, which is why life on Earth has evolved to utilise these wavelengths for vision and photosynthesis. Approximately 44% of the Sun's energy arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is in the visible light spectrum.\n*   **Infrared radiation** has a longer wavelength than visible light and is perceived as heat. It accounts for the largest share of the Sun's energy, making up approximately 49-50% of the total solar radiation.\n\nTogether, infrared radiation and visible light comprise over 90% of the total energy transferred from the Sun to the Earth.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: gamma rays and X-rays**\nGamma rays and X-rays are very high-energy, short-wavelength forms of electromagnetic radiation. While the Sun does produce them, particularly during solar flares, they constitute a very small fraction of its total energy output. Furthermore, most of this harmful radiation is absorbed by the Earth's upper atmosphere and does not reach the surface. Therefore, they are not a major component of the energy transfer.\n\n**C: microwaves and visible light**\nAlthough visible light is a major component of solar radiation, microwaves are not. Microwaves have longer wavelengths and lower energy than infrared radiation. The Sun emits microwaves, but at a much lower intensity compared to visible light and infrared radiation, so they contribute very little to the total energy received by the Earth.\n\n**D: radio waves and microwaves**\nRadio waves and microwaves are at the long-wavelength, low-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Sun is a source of these waves, but they represent a negligible fraction of the total energy it radiates.

As the Universe expands, the fabric of spacetime itself stretches. Light waves from distant galaxies travel through this expanding space, and as they do, their wavelengths are stretched, becoming longer. In the visible spectrum, longer wavelengths correspond to the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is known as redshift.\n\nAstronomical observations show that the light from nearly all distant galaxies is redshifted. Furthermore, there is a direct relationship: the more distant a galaxy is, the greater its redshift. This indicates that more distant galaxies are receding from us at a faster rate. This systematic recession of galaxies, observed through the redshift of their light, is the cornerstone evidence that the Universe is expanding.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: Stars in galaxies outside the Milky Way are all red.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Galaxies are vast collections of stars of many different types, ages, and temperatures, resulting in a range of colors, including blue, white, and yellow, not just red. This option incorrectly interprets the concept of \"redshift.\" Redshift is a shift of the entire spectrum of light towards longer, redder wavelengths; it does not mean that the objects themselves are intrinsically red.\n\n**B: The Andromeda galaxy is moving toward the Milky Way.**\nWhile it is true that the Andromeda galaxy is moving towards our own Milky Way galaxy, this is an example of local gravitational dynamics, not evidence for the expansion of the Universe. The expansion of the Universe is a large-scale phenomenon that describes the general tendency of galaxy clusters to move apart. On smaller, local scales, the force of gravity between nearby galaxies (like Andromeda and the Milky Way) can be strong enough to overcome this expansion, causing them to move towards each other. Therefore, this observation is an exception to the general rule of cosmic expansion, not evidence for it.\n\n**D: The Universe is 14 billion years old.**\nThe age of the Universe is a conclusion derived *from* the evidence of expansion, not the evidence itself. Scientists estimate the age of the Universe by measuring the current rate of expansion (known as the Hubble constant) and extrapolating back in time to a point when all matter was concentrated in a single point (the Big Bang). Therefore, the age of the Universe is a calculated result based on the model of an expanding Universe, which is supported by redshift observations."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_401.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "1 a student uses a metre ruler to measure the length of six identical table-tennis balls placed\nbetween two wooden blocks.\n32 38 62 65\nmetre ruler\ntable-tennis ball wooden block\nwhat is the diameter of one ball?\na 4cm b 5cm c 6cm d 8cm", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer: A\n\nThe diameter of a single table-tennis ball is determined by first measuring the total length of a number of identical balls and then dividing by that number.

The net moment is zero, so the rod is in rotational equilibrium.\nSince both conditions for equilibrium are satisfied, diagram A correctly shows the rod in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis arrangement is not in equilibrium because it fails to meet the condition for translational equilibrium.\n*   **Forces:** Two upward forces of 100 N are applied. The total upward force is 100 N + 100 N = 200 N. There are no downward forces to balance this upward force. As the rod is not attached to the pivot, the pivot cannot exert a downward pull. Consequently, there is a net upward force of 200 N, which will cause the rod to accelerate upwards and lift off the pivot.\n*   **Moments:** The moments are balanced (the clockwise moment from the left force equals the anticlockwise moment from the right force), so it is in rotational equilibrium. However, since it is not in translational equilibrium, the rod as a whole is not in equilibrium.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis arrangement is not in equilibrium because it fails to meet the condition for rotational equilibrium.\n*   **Forces:** There is a 100 N upward force on the left and a 100 N downward force on the right. The net force is 100 N - 100 N = 0. Therefore, the rod is in translational equilibrium.\n*   **Moments:** Both forces produce a turning effect in the same direction. The 100 N upward force on the left causes a clockwise moment, and the 100 N downward force on the right also causes a clockwise moment. Since both moments are in the same direction, they add together to create a net clockwise moment. This net moment will cause the rod to rotate in a clockwise direction.

It is calculated using the formula GPE = mgh, where 'm' is mass, 'g' is the gravitational field strength, and 'h' is the vertical height.

Since plants can be grown and harvested relatively quickly, this resource is considered renewable.\n2.  **Energy stored in tides:** Tidal energy is a result of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun. This is a predictable and continuous natural cycle that is not depleted by use.\n3.  **Geothermal resources:** This is heat energy from within the Earth, generated primarily by the natural decay of radioactive isotopes. This heat is continuously produced and is considered a vast, long-term resource.\n4.  **Hydroelectric resources:** This resource uses the gravitational potential energy of water, typically stored in a reservoir. The water is replenished through the water cycle, which is driven by solar energy.\n5.  **Light from the Sun:** Solar energy is a direct and virtually inexhaustible source of energy, as the Sun is expected to emit light and heat for billions of years.\n\nThe remaining two resources, chemical energy from fossil fuels and nuclear fuel, are non-renewable because they exist in finite quantities and are consumed far more rapidly than they are formed.

This is based on the principle of pressure, which is defined as force applied per unit area (Pressure = Force / Area).\n\nWhen a force is applied to a nail (for example, by a hammer), that force is transmitted to the tip of the nail. A sharp nail has a very small tip area. According to the pressure formula, when the same force is concentrated over a very small area, the resulting pressure is very high. This high pressure is sufficient to overcome the structural integrity of the wood, allowing the nail to penetrate it easily. In contrast, a blunt nail has a larger tip area, which distributes the same applied force over a wider surface. This results in a much lower pressure, which is often insufficient to push the wood fibres apart. Therefore, it is the larger pressure exerted by the sharp nail that makes it easier to push into the wood.\n\n---\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The sharp nail exerts a larger force on the wood.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The force exerted by the nail on the wood is equal to the force applied to the head of the nail. The sharpness of the nail's tip does not multiply or increase this applied force. For a given push or hammer strike, both a sharp and a blunt nail would transmit the same amount of force to the wood. The difference in their ability to penetrate the wood is not due to a difference in force, but rather how that force is concentrated into pressure.\n\n**B. The sharp nail exerts a smaller force on the wood.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As explained above, the force exerted by the nail on the wood is equal to the force applied to it. The sharpness of the nail does not reduce the force being transmitted. While it might take less applied force to successfully drive a sharp nail into wood, for any given applied force, the force exerted on the wood remains the same regardless of sharpness.\n\n**D. The sharp nail exerts a smaller pressure on the wood.**\nThis statement is incorrect and contradicts the definition of pressure (Pressure = Force / Area). A sharp nail is specifically designed to have a very small tip area. When force is applied, dividing that force by a very small area results in a very large pressure. A blunt nail, with its larger area, would exert a smaller pressure for the same applied force.

When the air in the bottle is heated by the Sun, its temperature increases. This increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in the average kinetic energy of the air particles. Since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2), an increase in average kinetic energy means the **average speed of the air particles increases**.\n\nThe problem states that the bottle is sealed and has a constant volume. 'Sealed' implies that the number of air particles inside the bottle remains constant. 'Constant volume' means that the space which these particles occupy does not change. The average distance between particles depends on the total volume and the number of particles within that volume. Since both the volume and the number of particles are constant, the **average distance between the air particles stays the same**. The particles will move faster and collide more frequently and forcefully with each other and the container walls (increasing the pressure), but their average separation does not change.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decreases, decreases**\nThis option is incorrect. Heating a gas provides energy to its particles, causing them to move faster, not slower. Therefore, the average speed increases.

While it correctly states that the average speed of the particles increases upon heating, it incorrectly claims that the average distance between them increases.

This means that as the volume of the gas increases, its pressure decreases, and as the volume decreases, its pressure increases, provided the temperature and mass of the gas remain constant. The mathematical relationship is pV = constant. A graph of p against V for an inverse relationship is a rectangular hyperbola, as shown in graph C. As V increases, p decreases, and the curve approaches the axes asymptotically.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Analysis:\n\n**A:** This graph shows a linear relationship passing through the origin, which represents a direct proportionality between pressure (p) and volume (V), meaning p \u221d V.

In this process, the particles of the medium (if one is present) oscillate or vibrate about their fixed equilibrium positions, but there is no net movement of the particles themselves in the direction of the wave's travel. For example, a cork on the surface of water will bob up and down as a wave passes but will return to its original position, demonstrating that energy has been transferred across the water without a net transfer of water (matter). This principle is the defining characteristic of all wave motion.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Explanations**\n\n**A. All waves can travel through a vacuum.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Waves are categorised into two main types: mechanical and electromagnetic. Mechanical waves, such as sound waves, water waves, and seismic waves, require a medium (a substance with particles) to travel. They propagate by causing the particles of the medium to vibrate. A vacuum is a space devoid of matter, so there are no particles to vibrate. Therefore, mechanical waves cannot travel through a vacuum. In contrast, electromagnetic waves (like light, radio waves, and X-rays) do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum. Since not all waves can do this, the statement is false.\n\n**B. All waves travel at the same speed.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The speed of a wave is determined by the type of wave and the properties of the medium through which it is travelling. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3.0 x 10\u2078 m/s, whereas the speed of sound in air at sea level is approximately 343 m/s. Furthermore, the speed of a single type of wave changes as it moves from one medium to another. Light travels slower in glass than in a vacuum, and sound travels much faster in solids, like steel, than it does in air. Therefore, waves do not all travel at the same speed.\n\n**C. Seismic S-waves can be modelled as longitudinal waves.**\nThis statement is incorrect. There are two main types of seismic body waves: P-waves (primary waves) and S-waves (secondary waves). P-waves are longitudinal waves, meaning the particles of the rock vibrate parallel to the direction of energy transfer, creating compressions and rarefactions. S-waves, however, are transverse waves. In an S-wave, the particles of the rock vibrate perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction of energy transfer.

This is the process where white light is separated into its constituent colours, forming a spectrum.\n\nThis separation occurs because the refractive index of the prism's material (e.g., glass) is slightly different for each colour of light. Specifically, the amount of bending, or refraction, depends on the wavelength of the light.\n\n1.  **Violet Light:** Violet light has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum.

In the given arrangement, this means it is deviated the most from its original path and will appear at position X.\n2.  **Red Light:** Red light has the longest wavelength. It is slowed down the least and is therefore refracted through the smallest angle. This means it is deviated the least and will appear at position Y.\n3.  **Green Light:** Green light has a wavelength that is intermediate between red and violet.

When comparing its properties to the original sound wave:\n\n*   **Amplitude:** The amplitude of a wave is related to its energy. As the original sound wave travels from the source to the wall and back to the listener, some of its energy is absorbed by the particles of the medium (air) and converted into thermal energy. Furthermore, when the sound reflects off the wall, the surface is not a perfect reflector and will absorb some of the wave's energy. Consequently, the reflected wave (the echo) has less energy and therefore a **lower** amplitude than the original wave. This is why an echo is always quieter than the original sound.\n\n*   **Frequency:** The frequency of a wave is determined by its source and dictates the pitch of the sound. The process of reflection does not change the frequency of the wave; the reflecting surface simply changes the wave's direction of travel. Therefore, the frequency of the echo is the **same** as the frequency of the original sound wave, meaning it has the same pitch.\n\n*   **Speed:** The speed of a sound wave depends on the properties of the medium through which it is travelling (e.g., temperature, density). Since both the original sound wave and the echo are travelling through the same medium (air) under the same conditions, their speed is the **same**.\n\nTherefore, the echo has a lower amplitude, but the same frequency and speed as the original sound wave.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n#### A) amplitude: lower, frequency: lower, speed: lower\nThis option is incorrect because the frequency and speed of the echo are the same as the original sound wave. The frequency is determined by the sound's source and does not change upon reflection. The speed of sound is constant in a given medium at a constant temperature. Only the amplitude is lower due to energy loss.\n\n#### C) amplitude: same, frequency: lower, speed: lower\nThis option is incorrect on all three properties. The amplitude of the echo is lower due to energy absorption by the medium and the reflecting surface. The frequency and speed of the echo are the same as the original wave, not lower, for the reasons explained above.\n\n#### D) amplitude: same, frequency: same, speed: same\nThis option is incorrect because it states that the amplitude remains the same. In reality, energy is always lost as a wave travels and reflects, causing the amplitude of the echo to be lower than the original sound.

Ferromagnetism is a property of certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, that results in a strong attraction to a magnet. This strong attraction occurs because the magnetic domains (small regions where the magnetic fields of atoms are aligned) within the iron align themselves with the external magnetic field of the magnet.

They do not possess the magnetic domain structure that allows for a strong attraction to a magnet. These metals are classified as **diamagnetic**, which means they are actually very weakly repelled by a magnetic field. This repulsion is extremely weak and not noticeable under normal circumstances.

This ensures that all the charge flowing through the component also flows through the ammeter.\n\nIn **Circuit 1** and **Circuit 2**, the ammeter is connected in series with the resistor. A series circuit has only one path for the current to flow. Therefore, the current is the same at all points in the circuit.

In both circuits, the ammeter will correctly measure the total current flowing from the source, which is the same current that flows through the resistor.\n\nIn **Circuit 3**, the ammeter is connected in parallel with the resistor. This is an incorrect connection. In a parallel arrangement, the current splits between the different branches. An ideal ammeter has very low resistance. Consequently, most of the current will bypass the resistor and flow through the low-resistance path of the ammeter.

To be effective, a fuse must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  Its current rating must be slightly higher than the normal operating current of the appliance to prevent it from blowing during normal use.\n2.  Its current rating must be lower than the maximum current the connecting cable can safely carry, to ensure the fuse blows before the cable overheats and becomes a fire hazard.\n\nIn this case, the heater's normal operating current is 5.0 A, and its cable can safely carry a maximum of 15 A. A 10 A fuse is rated above the operating current (10 A > 5.0 A) but below the cable's maximum capacity (10 A < 15 A). This makes it the most suitable choice, as it will allow the heater to operate normally but will break the circuit if a fault causes the current to rise to a level that would endanger the cable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\nA fuse's rating must be greater than the normal operating current of the appliance it is protecting. The electrical heater operates at a current of 5.0 A. A 4.0 A fuse has a rating that is lower than this operating current. Consequently, this fuse would blow and break the circuit as soon as the heater is switched on, preventing it from functioning at all.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nA primary function of a fuse is to protect the wiring of an appliance. For this protection to be effective, the fuse's current rating must be less than the maximum current the cable can safely handle. The heater's cable is rated for a maximum current of 15 A. A 20 A fuse has a rating higher than this limit. If a fault were to cause the current to surge to a value between 15 A and 20 A (e.g., 18 A), the cable would overheat and become a serious fire risk before the 20 A fuse would blow.

This is described by Faraday's Law of Induction. The total e.m.f. is the sum of the e.m.f.s induced in each individual turn of the coil. By increasing the number of turns, more lengths of wire are cutting the magnetic flux at any given moment. This increases the total rate of change of magnetic flux linkage, which in turn induces a larger overall e.m.f.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. placing the magnets further apart**\nThis action would decrease the induced e.m.f. The strength of the magnetic field is greatest in the region directly between the poles. Moving the magnets further apart weakens the magnetic field that the coil rotates through. According to Faraday's Law, a weaker magnetic field (lower magnetic flux density) results in a smaller rate of change of magnetic flux as the coil turns, thereby inducing a smaller e.m.f.\n\n**C. using a coil made from steel wire**\nThe magnitude of the induced e.m.f. depends on the rate of change of magnetic flux, the strength of the magnetic field, and the number of turns in the coil, not on the material of the wire itself. Copper is used because it is an excellent electrical conductor with low resistance. Steel has a much higher resistance. While an e.m.f. would still be induced in a steel wire, its high resistance would lead to a smaller current and significant energy loss as heat, making it less efficient, but it would not increase the induced e.m.f.\n\n**D. reversing one of the magnets**\nReversing one of the magnets would reverse the direction of the magnetic field lines (e.g., from left-to-right instead of right-to-left).

This relationship is described by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule. To reverse the direction of the force, one must reverse the direction of either the current or the magnetic field. Therefore, reversing the current will cause the direction of the force on the wire to reverse.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: increasing the current**\nThe magnitude of the force on the wire is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current flowing through it. Increasing the current will increase the size of the force, but it will not change its direction, as the directions of the current and magnetic field remain the same.\n\n**C: increasing the strength of the magnetic field**\nThe magnitude of the force on the wire is also directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.

It consists of two coils, a primary and a secondary, wound on a soft iron core. An alternating current in the primary coil generates a continuously changing magnetic field within the core. This changing magnetic field links with the secondary coil, inducing an alternating electromotive force (e.m.f.), or voltage, across it. The ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage is determined by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil to the number of turns in the primary coil. By designing the transformer with different numbers of turns on each coil, the voltage can be either increased (stepped up) or decreased (stepped down).\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:** Converting a direct current (DC) into an alternating current (AC) is the function of a device called an inverter. Transformers rely on a changing magnetic field to induce a voltage in the secondary coil. Since a direct current is steady and produces a constant magnetic field, it cannot induce a continuous voltage in the secondary coil. Therefore, transformers do not operate with DC and cannot convert it to AC.\n\n**C:** A transformer does not change the frequency of the alternating current or voltage. The frequency of the alternating voltage induced in the secondary coil is determined by the rate at which the magnetic field is changing. This rate is set by the frequency of the alternating current in the primary coil. As a result, the output frequency of a transformer is always the same as its input frequency.\n\n**D:** The function of interrupting a circuit when there is a fault, such as a current surge, is performed by safety devices like fuses or circuit breakers. These devices are specifically designed to protect circuits from damage by stopping the flow of excessive current. A transformer's purpose is to alter voltage levels for power transmission and in electronic devices, not to act as a safety switch."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_434.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "34 what are the relative charges on a proton, a neutron and an electron?\n[pier [ neutron | eecon |\na 0 -1 +1\nb 0 -1 -1\ncc +1 0 -1\nd +1 0 +1", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: C\n\nAn atom is composed of three fundamental subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n*   **Protons**, located in the nucleus, carry a positive electric charge.

For a radioactive decay process to change one element into another, it must change the number of protons in the nucleus.\n\n*   **Alpha Decay:** In alpha decay, a nucleus emits an alpha-particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The emission of two protons means the atomic number of the parent nucleus decreases by 2. This change in the atomic number results in the formation of a new element. For example, Uranium-238 (92 protons) decays into Thorium-234 (90 protons).\n\n*   **Beta Decay:** In beta decay, a neutron within the nucleus transforms into a proton, and an electron (the beta-particle) is emitted. Since a neutron has been converted into a proton, the total number of protons in the nucleus increases by 1. This change in the atomic number results in the formation of a new element. For example, Carbon-14 (6 protons) decays into Nitrogen-14 (7 protons).\n\n*   **Gamma Decay:** Gamma decay involves the emission of a high-energy photon, called a gamma ray, from an excited nucleus. This process releases excess energy from the nucleus but does not change the number of protons or neutrons. Since the atomic number remains the same, the element does not change. Gamma emission often follows an alpha or beta decay.\n\nTherefore, both alpha and beta decay cause the nucleus of one element to change into the nucleus of another, while gamma decay does not.\n\n---\n### Why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **B:** This option is incorrect because it states that beta decay does not cause a change in the element.

Radioactive decay, the process that produces \u03b3-rays, is a spontaneous nuclear phenomenon. The rate of decay depends on the specific radioactive isotope and is characterised by its half-life. This rate is not influenced by external physical conditions such as temperature, pressure, or chemical environment. Therefore, lowering the temperature of the \u03b3-ray source will have no effect on the rate at which it emits radiation, and consequently, it will not reduce the radiation dose received by the scientist.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. keeping the distance between the source and the scientist as large as possible**\nThis action **will** reduce the radiation that reaches the scientist. Radiation from a point source spreads out in all directions. According to the inverse square law, the intensity of the radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the source. By doubling the distance, the radiation intensity at the scientist's location is reduced to one-quarter. Therefore, maximising the distance from the source is a fundamental and effective principle of radiation safety.\n\n**C. keeping the time for which the scientist uses the source as small as possible**\nThis action **will** reduce the total radiation that reaches the scientist. The total radiation dose absorbed is a product of the radiation dose rate (the amount of radiation received per unit of time) and the duration of exposure. By minimising the time spent near the radioactive source, the total cumulative dose of radiation is proportionally reduced. This is a key principle in radiation protection, often referred to as minimising exposure time.\n\n**D. placing a lead screen between the scientist and the source**\nThis action **will** reduce the radiation that reaches the scientist. Gamma (\u03b3) rays are highly penetrating, but their intensity can be reduced by passing them through a dense material. This is known as shielding. Lead is a very dense material and is particularly effective at absorbing \u03b3-ray energy. Placing a lead screen between the source and the scientist acts as a barrier, absorbing a significant portion of the radiation and thus lowering the dose that reaches the scientist."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_438.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w23_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 which time period is approximately equal to 24 hours?\na the time for the earth to complete one rotation on its axis\nb the time for the earth to orbit the sun\nc the time for the moon to orbit the earth\nd the time for the sun to orbit the earth", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\n**A. the time for the Earth to complete one rotation on its axis**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the time period that is approximately 24 hours.

All other elements, including iron, constitute less than 2% of the Sun's mass.

A very significant portion of its total energy output, approximately 49%, is also emitted in the infrared region.

While the length is correctly calculated as 35 cm (45 cm - 10 cm), the width is misread. If the top edge of the sheet were mistaken to be at the 30 cm mark instead of the 25 cm mark, the width would be calculated as 30 cm - 5 cm = 25 cm.

On a speed-time graph, the acceleration is represented by the gradient (or steepness) of the line. The gradient is calculated by dividing the change in speed (the 'rise' on the vertical axis) by the change in time (the 'run' on the horizontal axis).\n\nA steeper line has a larger gradient, which corresponds to a greater acceleration. By inspecting the graph, the line segment in section B is the steepest among all sections with a positive slope (A, B, and C). This indicates that the object experiences the greatest increase in speed per unit of time in this section. Therefore, the object has the largest acceleration in section B.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A:**\nThe line in section A has a positive gradient, which indicates that the object is accelerating. However, the gradient of the line in section A is less steep than the gradient of the line in section B. A less steep gradient signifies a smaller acceleration. Therefore, the acceleration in section A is positive but smaller than the acceleration in section B.\n\n**C:**\nThe line in section C also shows a positive gradient, meaning the object is accelerating. However, by comparing the steepness of the lines, it is clear that the gradient of section C is less steep than that of section B. This means the rate at which the speed increases is lower in section C than in section B. Consequently, the acceleration in section C is not the largest.\n\n**D:**\nThe line in section D is horizontal. A horizontal line on a speed-time graph has a gradient of zero.

According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (a = F/m).\n\nThe force of gravity (weight) is calculated as W = mg, where 'm' is the mass of the object and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity (or gravitational field strength). Since the net force F is equal to the weight W, we have:\nma = mg\n\nBy dividing both sides by the mass 'm', we find that the acceleration 'a' of the object is equal to the acceleration due to gravity 'g':\na = g\n\nFor objects falling \"close to the Earth's surface\", the gravitational field strength 'g' is considered to be uniform and constant, with an approximate value of 9.8 m/s\u00b2.

As an object falls, its speed increases. Air resistance is a force that opposes motion and increases with speed. This increasing upward force of air resistance would counteract the constant downward force of gravity, reducing the net downward force. A decreasing net force results in a decreasing acceleration. However, the problem explicitly states that air resistance can be ignored, making this option incorrect.\n\n**C: The acceleration increases as the body falls.**\nThere is no physical principle in this scenario that would cause the acceleration of a falling object to increase. The force causing the acceleration is gravity, which is assumed to be constant near the Earth's surface. Since the force is constant and the mass of the object is constant, the acceleration must also be constant.\n\n**D: The acceleration is zero.**\nZero acceleration implies that the net force on the object is zero, according to Newton's Second Law (F=ma). If the acceleration were zero, the object's velocity would remain constant (or it would remain at rest).

It is calculated as the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force. A larger moment results in a greater turning effect. For example, when using a spanner to tighten a nut, applying a force further from the nut (the pivot) creates a larger moment and makes it easier to turn. Therefore, the moment of a force quantifies this turning effect.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: the acceleration produced by the force**\nAcceleration is the rate of change of an object's velocity. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), a resultant force applied to an object causes it to accelerate linearly. This law describes the relationship between force, mass, and the resulting change in linear motion, not the rotational or turning effect of the force. While a moment can cause *angular* acceleration, the term \"acceleration\" in this context typically refers to linear acceleration.\n\n**C: the time for which the force acts**\nThe time for which a force acts is a component in the calculation of impulse. Impulse is defined as the product of the force and the time interval over which it is applied (Impulse = F \u00d7 t). Impulse measures the change in an object's momentum. This is a distinct physical quantity from the moment of a force, which involves distance, not time, and relates to rotation, not a change in momentum.\n\n**D: the increase in energy caused by the force**\nThe increase in energy caused by a force is related to the concept of work done. Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force (Work Done = F \u00d7 d). By the work-energy principle, the work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy. The moment of a force, however, is calculated using the perpendicular distance to a pivot and measures a turning effect, not the energy transferred to the object."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_447.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "7 two identical containers, p and q, are partly filled with different quantities of sand.\nthe position of the centre of gravity for each container is labelled x.\npp q\nwhich container is more stable and what is the reason why it is more stable?\na_ pis more stable because it has a lower centre of gravity.\nb_ pis more stable because it has a smaller mass.\nc qis more stable because it has a greater depth of sand.\nd qis more stable because it has a higher centre of gravity.", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAn object's stability refers to its ability to resist toppling over. A key principle of stability is that an object becomes more stable as its centre of gravity is lowered. A lower centre of gravity means that a larger angle of tilt is required before the vertical line of action of the object's weight falls outside its base of support. This requires more work to be done to raise the centre of gravity to the tipping point. In this case, container P has a lower centre of gravity than container Q. Therefore, container P is more stable.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. P is more stable because it has a smaller mass.**\nWhile it is true that container P has a smaller mass due to having less sand, mass itself is not the direct determinant of stability. The stability of an object depends on the position of its centre of gravity relative to its base of support. An object with a smaller mass is not necessarily more stable than an object with a larger mass. The distribution of that mass is what matters. The reason P is more stable is its lower centre of gravity, not its smaller mass.\n\n**C. Q is more stable because it has a greater depth of sand.**\nContainer Q does have a greater depth of sand, which results in a greater mass. However, this also causes its overall centre of gravity to be higher than that of container P. A higher centre of gravity makes an object less stable, as it needs to be tilted by a smaller angle for it to topple. Therefore, container Q is less stable, not more stable.\n\n**D. Q is more stable because it has a higher centre of gravity.**\nThis statement contains a correct observation but an incorrect conclusion. Container Q does have a higher centre of gravity compared to container P. However, a higher centre of gravity leads to reduced stability, not increased stability.

The correct formula is Power = Energy / Time, which yields 24 J / 60 s = 0.4 W.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis answer is incorrect because it mistakes the value of energy transferred for the value of power. The value given, 24 J, is the amount of energy transferred, not the power output. Power represents the *rate* of energy transfer, meaning it must account for the time over which the energy is transferred. To find the power, the energy (24 J) must be divided by the time (60 s).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis answer is incorrect and likely arises from multiplying the energy and time values (24 J \u00d7 60 s = 1440).

Pressure is defined as the force applied perpendicular to a surface divided by the area over which the force is distributed (Pressure = Force / Area).\n\nIn this scenario, the force is the weight of each sculpture. The problem states that all sculptures have an equal weight. Therefore, the force (F) is constant for all four options.\n\nTo be the *least* likely to sink, a sculpture must exert the *lowest* possible pressure on the sand. According to the pressure formula (P = F/A), for a constant force (F), the pressure (P) is inversely proportional to the area (A). This means that the largest contact area will result in the lowest pressure.\n\nSculpture D is a short, wide cylinder. By visual inspection, it has the largest circular base area of the four sculptures. By distributing its weight over this larger area, it exerts the least amount of pressure on the sand and is, therefore, the least likely to sink.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A:** Sculpture A, the cone, rests on a circular base. However, its base area is visibly smaller than that of sculpture D. Since both sculptures have the same weight (force), sculpture A will exert a higher pressure on the sand than sculpture D because its force is concentrated over a smaller area. Consequently, it is more likely to sink than sculpture D.\n\n**B:** Sculpture B, the ovoid or sphere, rests on the sand at a single point. This means its contact area with the sand is extremely small. With the entire weight of the sculpture concentrated on this tiny area, the resulting pressure (P = F/A) is extremely high. This very high pressure makes sculpture B the most likely to sink, not the least.\n\n**C:** Sculpture C is a tall, narrow cylinder with a small circular base. Its contact area is significantly smaller than that of sculpture D. Because it has the same weight as sculpture D but a much smaller base area, it will exert a much higher pressure on the sand.

Therefore, the volume of the substance increases substantially when it changes from liquid water to gaseous steam.\n\n2.  **Change in Density:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume (\u03c1 = m/V). The problem states that the mass of the water remains the same as it turns into steam.

For a water wave, the particles of water oscillate up and down about the undisturbed water level (the mean position). The amplitude is therefore the maximum vertical distance a water particle reaches above or sinks below this mean position. This corresponds to the height of a crest or the depth of a trough measured from the equilibrium level.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B:** \"How far the wave travels every second\" is the definition of the **wave speed** (v). Wave speed describes the rate at which the wave energy propagates through the medium (in this case, water). It is a distinct property from amplitude, which relates to the energy of the wave and the displacement of the medium's particles.\n\n**C:** \"The number of waves passing a point every second\" defines the **frequency** (f) of the wave, measured in Hertz (Hz).

This change in direction is caused by a change in the speed of the wave. In the context of water waves, the depth of the water acts as the medium. Water waves travel at a higher speed in deep water compared to shallow water. When the wavefronts enter the deep water region at an angle, one part of the wavefront speeds up before the other, causing the entire wave to pivot or bend. This bending of the wave as it crosses the boundary between shallow and deep water is the definition of refraction. The diagram also shows that the wavelength (the distance between successive wavefronts) increases in the deep water, which is consistent with the increase in speed (since wave speed = frequency \u00d7 wavelength, and frequency remains constant).\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. diffraction**\n\nDiffraction is the spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture (a gap) or around an obstacle. This effect is most noticeable when the size of the gap or obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the wave. The phenomenon shown involves a change in the medium (water depth), not an interaction with a gap or an obstacle. Therefore, the effect is not diffraction.\n\n**B. dispersion**\n\nDispersion is the splitting of a wave composed of multiple frequencies into its constituent parts as it passes through a medium. This occurs because the wave speed in the medium depends on the frequency. A classic example is a prism splitting white light into a spectrum of colours. The diagram shows a monochromatic wave (a wave of a single frequency), and it is not being split into different components. Instead, the entire wave is changing its direction of travel.\n\n**C. reflection**\n\nReflection occurs when a wave strikes a boundary between two media and bounces back into the original medium. While some reflection may occur at the boundary between shallow and deep water, the primary effect illustrated is the wave passing *through* the boundary and continuing its propagation in the new medium, but in a different direction.

This is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors, forming a spectrum.\n\nThe process occurs in two stages of refraction:\n1.  **First Refraction:** As white light enters the prism from the air, it slows down and refracts (bends). The refractive index of glass is slightly different for each color (wavelength) of light. Violet light has a shorter wavelength and experiences a higher refractive index, causing it to bend more than red light, which has a longer wavelength and a lower refractive index. This initial refraction causes the white light to begin splitting into its colors.\n2.  **Second Refraction:** As the separated colors exit the prism back into the air, they speed up and refract again, bending away from the normal. This second refraction increases the angular separation between the colors.\n\nThe overall result is that red light is deviated the least from its original path, while violet light is deviated the most. Diagram A correctly illustrates this entire process: the light splits at the first surface, separates further at the second surface, and the final spectrum shows red light on top (least deviated) and violet light at the bottom (most deviated).\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**B:** This diagram is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it shows the light bending upwards, away from the base of the prism, which is physically impossible. Light always refracts towards the thicker part of the prism (the base). Secondly, it incorrectly shows the dispersion occurring only at the second surface as the light exits. Dispersion begins as soon as the white light enters the first surface of the prism.\n\n**C:** This diagram correctly shows the light bending towards the base of the prism and splitting at both surfaces. However, it shows the incorrect order of colors in the resulting spectrum. Red light is depicted as being deviated more than violet light. This is wrong, as violet light (shorter wavelength) bends more than red light (longer wavelength) when passing through glass.\n\n**D:** This diagram is incorrect because it shows the dispersion of white light occurring only at the second surface, as the light exits the prism. The splitting of colors, due to the different refractive indices for each wavelength, begins at the first point of refraction when the light enters the prism.

Both of these calculations are incorrect applications of the physics principles involved. The calculation for distance requires multiplying speed by time, not dividing speed by an arbitrary number.\n\n*   **B) 340 m:** This value could be calculated by incorrectly using only one second of the travel time (i.e., one-quarter of the total time) in the distance formula (340 m/s \u00d7 1 s = 340 m).

Determining the Force:**\nSteel is a ferromagnetic material. When a magnet is brought near an unmagnetised ferromagnetic material, it induces magnetism in that material.

However, it incorrectly identifies the resulting force as repulsion.\n\nA magnet will attract an unmagnetised ferromagnetic material like steel through the process of magnetic induction. The pole of the magnet nearest to the steel bar (in this case, the South pole Y) induces an opposite pole (a North pole) in the part of the steel bar closest to it. The attraction between these opposite poles (S and induced N) is always stronger than the repulsion between the like poles (S and induced S at the far end of the bar) because the attracting poles are closer together.

By convention, magnetic field lines emerge from the North pole and enter the South pole. The arrows in the diagram clearly show the field lines originating from end X and entering end Y.

This configuration is known as a **series circuit**. A defining characteristic of a series circuit is that there is only one path for the electric current to flow.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of charge, charge is not created or destroyed within a circuit. This means that the rate of flow of charge, which is the electric current, must be the same at every point in a simple, unbranched loop. The current flowing out of the battery at point X is the same current that flows through the first resistor, then through point Y, through the second resistor, and back to the battery. Therefore, the current at Y is **equal to** the current at X.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**A: parallel, less than X**\nThis option is incorrect because the resistors are not arranged in parallel. A parallel arrangement involves multiple branches, providing more than one path for the current to flow. In the given circuit, there is only a single path. Furthermore, in a series circuit, the current is constant throughout, not less at a point further along the circuit.\n\n**B: parallel, equal to X**\nThis option is incorrect because the resistors are arranged in series, not parallel. In a parallel circuit, the main current from the source (at a point like X) would split to flow through the different branches. The current in any single branch would be less than the total current at X. While this option correctly identifies that the current could be equal in some specific (but not this) configuration, the initial premise of a parallel arrangement is false for this circuit diagram.\n\n**C: series, less than X**\nThis option correctly identifies that the resistors are in series but incorrectly compares the currents. A common misconception is that current is \"used up\" as it passes through components like resistors. However, current is the rate of flow of charge, and charge is conserved. The same amount of charge that flows past point X per second also flows past point Y per second. Therefore, the current is equal at all points in a series circuit, not less at Y than at X."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_470.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "30 the mains voltage is 120v.\nwhich fuse should be fitted to an electric kettle with a power of 1.5kw?\na 3a b 5a cc 10a d 13a", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe relationship between electrical power (P), voltage (V), and current (I) is described by the formula P = V \u00d7 I. To determine the appropriate fuse, one must first calculate the normal operating current drawn by the appliance.\n\n1.  **Convert Power to Standard Units:** The power of the kettle is given as 1.5 kW. To use the formula, this must be converted to watts (W):\n    P = 1.5 kW \u00d7 1000 W/kW = 1500 W.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Operating Current:** Rearrange the power formula to solve for current (I):\n    I = P / V\n\n3.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    I = 1500 W / 120 V\n    I = 12.5 A\n\nThe normal operating current for the kettle is 12.5 A. A fuse is a safety device designed to protect an appliance by breaking the circuit if the current becomes dangerously high. The fuse rating must be slightly higher than the normal operating current to prevent it from blowing during regular use, but close enough to provide protection in case of a fault or surge.\n\nOf the available options, 13 A is the next standard fuse rating just above the calculated operating current of 12.5 A. This allows the kettle to function correctly while ensuring the circuit is protected.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A) 3 A**\nThis fuse rating is incorrect. The calculated operating current for the kettle is 12.5 A. A 3 A fuse has a rating significantly lower than this. If a 3 A fuse were fitted, it would blow immediately upon switching the kettle on, as the current required for normal operation (12.5 A) would far exceed the fuse's limit.\n\n**B) 5 A**\nThis fuse rating is incorrect. The kettle requires 12.5 A to operate normally. A 5 A fuse is rated for a much lower current. Consequently, the fuse would blow and break the circuit as soon as the appliance is turned on, preventing it from functioning.\n\n**C) 10 A**\nThis fuse rating is incorrect. The normal operating current of the kettle is 12.5 A. A 10 A fuse has a rating that is below this required current.

The rate of change of magnetic flux is influenced by two key factors in this scenario: the strength of the magnet and the speed of its motion relative to the coil.\n\n1.  **Strength of the magnet:** A stronger magnet produces a more intense magnetic field, resulting in a greater magnetic flux. Therefore, moving a strong magnet into a coil causes a larger change in magnetic flux compared to moving a weak magnet.\n2.  **Speed of motion:** A faster-moving magnet causes the magnetic flux through the coil to change more rapidly. A greater rate of change of magnetic flux induces a larger e.m.f.\n\nTo induce the **largest e.m.f.**, both factors should be maximised. Arrangement Z uses a strong magnet moving quickly. This combination produces the greatest rate of change of magnetic flux linkage and, consequently, the largest induced e.m.f.\n\nTo induce the **smallest e.m.f.**, both factors should be minimised. Arrangement Y uses a weak magnet moving slowly. This combination results in the smallest and slowest change in magnetic flux linkage, thus inducing the smallest e.m.f.\n\nTherefore, arrangement Z induces the largest e.m.f., and arrangement Y induces the smallest e.m.f.\n\n---\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers\n\n**A: largest X, smallest Y**\nThis option is incorrect because arrangement X does not produce the largest e.m.f.

Arrangement Z also uses a strong magnet but moves it quickly, resulting in a greater rate of change of magnetic flux and a larger induced e.m.f. than in arrangement X.\n\n**B: largest Y, smallest Z**\nThis option is incorrect as it reverses the correct relationship. Arrangement Y produces the smallest e.m.f. because it combines a weak magnet with slow speed, leading to the lowest rate of change of magnetic flux. Conversely, arrangement Z produces the largest e.m.f. due to its strong magnet and high speed, which maximizes the rate of change of magnetic flux.\n\n**C: largest Z, smallest X**\nThis option is incorrect because arrangement X does not produce the smallest e.m.f. While the magnet in arrangement X moves slowly, it is a strong magnet. Arrangement Y combines a weak magnet with slow movement. The effect of the weaker magnet in Y leads to a smaller change in flux compared to the strong magnet in X (at the same slow speed), thus inducing a smaller e.m.f. than in arrangement X."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_472.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_11.pdf", "questionText": "32 the diagrams show a current-carrying wire with an arrow in the direction of the current.\nwhich diagram shows the magnetic field produced by the current?\na b\n|_\u2014- magnetic moe\na a a kk field lines cs e% oy ge : field lines\na a a\ni \\ np ae ee en\n| wire wire\ncc d\neen negnetiy ng _-\u2014 magnetic\nen _---7\u201d __. field lines\neee arene i lines \u201cret\n\u2014\n\\ aon ptr anee set\na ee ar || eee eee eee ts, wire\nen ee \u201cey", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: B\n\nThe magnetic field produced by a current flowing through a long, straight wire consists of concentric circles centered on the wire.

For maximum efficiency, the material must be easily magnetised and demagnetised by the alternating current. Soft iron is a 'magnetically soft' material, meaning it has high magnetic permeability (is easily magnetised) and low retentivity (loses its magnetism easily). This allows the magnetic flux to change rapidly with the alternating current, minimising energy loss due to hysteresis.\n\n*   **The Coils:** The primary and secondary coils (or windings) carry the electric current. To minimise energy loss in the form of heat (Joule heating), the material for these coils must have very low electrical resistance. Copper is an excellent electrical conductor and is ductile, making it the ideal material for winding the coils.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a soft iron core and copper coils results in the most efficient transformer construction.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**\n\n*   **A. copper for the core and steel for the coils wound around it:** This is incorrect.

Although copper is the correct choice for the coils, steel is not suitable for the core. Steel is a 'magnetically hard' material, meaning that while it can be strongly magnetised, it retains its magnetism (has high retentivity). In a transformer's alternating magnetic field, a significant amount of energy would be wasted in continuously overcoming this retentivity to reverse the core's magnetisation.

This is achieved when the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus is exactly equal to the number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus.\n\nIn diagram B, the central nucleus contains two protons (each with a +1 charge) and two neutrons (which have no charge). The total positive charge of the nucleus is therefore +2. Orbiting the nucleus are two electrons (each with a -1 charge), giving a total negative charge of -2. Since the total positive charge (+2) balances the total negative charge (-2), the atom is electrically neutral.

This means that for any given unstable nucleus, it is impossible to predict the exact moment it will decay. While the rate of decay for a large population of atoms can be described statistically by its half-life, this is a probabilistic measure and does not determine the fate of any single atom.\n\nThe fact that two atoms have already decayed provides no information about which of the remaining unstable atoms will decay next. The decay of one atom does not influence the decay of another. Each of the remaining atoms (2, 4, and 5) has a certain probability of decaying in the next instant, but which one actually does so is entirely a matter of chance. Therefore, it is impossible to predict which atom will be the third to give out an alpha particle.\n\n### **Explanations for Incorrect Answers**\n\n#### **A: atom 2**\nThis choice is incorrect because it implies a predictable, sequential order of decay based on the arbitrary numbering of the atoms. Radioactive decay is not an orderly, sequential process. The decay of an individual nucleus is a random event, and the label \"atom 2\" has no physical significance in determining when it will decay relative to the other remaining atoms.\n\n#### **B: atom 4**\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as the others; it assumes a predictable outcome for a random process. The decay of a specific nucleus cannot be determined in advance. Each of the remaining unstable atoms has an equal probability of decaying at any moment (assuming they are identical isotopes), and there is no physical law that dictates that atom 4 will decay before atom 2 or atom 5.\n\n#### **C: atom 5**\nThis choice is incorrect because it suggests a specific, predictable event. The core principle of radioactive decay is its randomness. Selecting any particular atom as the next to decay contradicts this principle.

It has no mass and no charge, which gives it very high penetrating power. Consequently, gamma rays can pass through materials that would stop other forms of radiation. While a thick aluminium sheet will reduce the intensity of gamma radiation (a process called attenuation), it will not stop it completely. Since the radiation detector shows a reading greater than the background reading, it means that radiation from the source has successfully penetrated the thick aluminium sheet. Gamma radiation is the only type of nuclear radiation listed with sufficient penetrating power to do this.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nAlpha (\u03b1) radiation consists of alpha particles, which are equivalent to helium nuclei (two protons and two neutrons). Due to their relatively large mass and +2 charge, alpha particles are highly ionising but have very low penetrating power. They can be stopped by a single sheet of paper or just a few centimetres of air. A thick aluminium sheet would completely absorb any alpha radiation, preventing it from reaching the detector. Therefore, if the source were emitting alpha radiation, the detector's reading would be at the background level, not above it.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**\nBeta (\u03b2) radiation consists of high-speed electrons (or positrons). These particles are smaller and have less charge than alpha particles, giving them greater penetrating power. However, beta radiation is stopped by a few millimetres of aluminium. The setup specifies a *thick* aluminium sheet, which would be sufficient to absorb all beta particles completely. If the source were emitting beta radiation, it would not be able to pass through the aluminium to the detector.

A diameter of 100 light-years would only encompass a very small, local neighbourhood of stars and is far too small to represent the entire Milky Way galaxy, which contains hundreds of billions of stars.\n\n**B) 1000 light-years:** This distance is significantly larger but still incorrect. A distance of 1000 light-years is closer to the approximate *thickness* of the Milky Way's galactic disk, not its diameter. The diameter measures the galaxy from one edge to the opposite edge across its widest point.\n\n**C) 10 000 light-years:** While a substantial distance, 10,000 light-years is still only about one-tenth of the actual approximate diameter of the Milky Way. This distance is more comparable to the scale of the galaxy's central bulge or the distance from our Sun to the inner regions of the galaxy, but not its full span."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_481.jpg", "Answer": "C", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "1 astudent measures the volumes of three liquids using three different measuring cylinders.\ncm?\n40\n30\ncm? cm?\n2.0 4.0\n20\n15 3.0\n1.0 2.0 140\n0.5 1.0\n1 2 3\nthe table shows the volumes recorded by the student.\nmeasuring volume\ncylinder /om?\n1 1.2\n2 2.2\n3 25\nwhich readings are correctly recorded?\na 1,2and3 b 1tand2only c 1and3only' d 1only", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct answer is **C**. This is because the volumes for measuring cylinders 1 and 3 are recorded correctly, while the volume for measuring cylinder 2 is not. To determine the correctness of each reading, we must carefully examine the scale of each measuring cylinder and compare the reading to the value recorded in the table.\n\n**Analysis of Measuring Cylinder 1:**\n1.  **Determine the scale:** The numbered markings are at intervals of 0.5 cm\u00b3 (e.g., 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). Between 1.0 cm\u00b3 and 1.5 cm\u00b3, there are five divisions. Therefore, the value of the smallest division is (1.5 - 1.0) cm\u00b3 / 5 = 0.1 cm\u00b3.\n2.  **Read the volume:** When reading the volume of a liquid in a measuring cylinder, the reading should be taken from the bottom of the meniscus. The meniscus is at the second mark above 1.0 cm\u00b3. The volume is therefore 1.0 cm\u00b3 + (2 \u00d7 0.1 cm\u00b3) = 1.2 cm\u00b3.\n3.  **Compare with the recorded value:** The student recorded the volume as 1.2 cm\u00b3. This matches the reading from the scale. Thus, reading 1 is correctly recorded.\n\n**Analysis of Measuring Cylinder 3:**\n1.  **Determine the scale:** The numbered markings are at intervals of 10 cm\u00b3 (e.g., 20, 30, 40). Between 20 cm\u00b3 and 30 cm\u00b3, there are five divisions. Therefore, the value of the smallest division is (30 - 20) cm\u00b3 / 5 = 2 cm\u00b3. The markings represent volumes of 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 cm\u00b3.\n2.  **Read the volume:** The meniscus is located exactly halfway between the 24 cm\u00b3 mark and the 26 cm\u00b3 mark. When a reading falls between the markings on a scale, a reasonable estimate should be made. The value halfway between 24 and 26 is 25 cm\u00b3.\n3.  **Compare with the recorded value:** The student recorded the volume as 25 cm\u00b3. This is a correct estimation of the volume. Thus, reading 3 is correctly recorded.\n\n**Analysis of Measuring Cylinder 2:**\n1.  **Determine the scale:** The numbered markings are at intervals of 1.0 cm\u00b3 (e.g., 2.0, 3.0, 4.0). Between 2.0 cm\u00b3 and 3.0 cm\u00b3, there are five divisions. Therefore, the value of the smallest division is (3.0 - 2.0) cm\u00b3 / 5 = 0.2 cm\u00b3. The markings represent volumes of 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8 cm\u00b3.\n2.  **Read the volume:** The meniscus is on the first mark above the 2.0 cm\u00b3 line. The volume is therefore 2.0 cm\u00b3 + 0.2 cm\u00b3 = 2.2 cm\u00b3.\n3.  **Compare with the recorded value:** The student recorded the volume as 2.2 cm\u00b3. Although the value read from the instrument is 2.2 cm\u00b3, this reading is considered incorrectly recorded in the context of precision. The scale has an unusual interval of 0.2 cm\u00b3. Recording a value of 2.2 suggests a precision of 0.1 cm\u00b3, which is not directly supported by an instrument that is marked in increments of 0.2 cm\u00b3. Such a recording is considered ambiguous. Therefore, reading 2 is deemed incorrectly recorded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince readings 1 and 3 are correctly recorded, but reading 2 is not, the correct option is C.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **A: 1, 2 and 3**\n    This option is incorrect because, as explained above, the reading for measuring cylinder 2 is considered incorrectly recorded due to the ambiguity of its precision relative to the scale's 0.2 cm\u00b3 divisions.\n\n*   **B: 1 and 2 only**\n    This option is incorrect. While reading 1 is correct, reading 2 is considered incorrect. Furthermore, reading 3 is also correctly recorded, which this option omits.\n\n*   **D: 1 only**\n    This option is incorrect because the reading for measuring cylinder 3 (25 cm\u00b3) is also a correctly recorded volume, as it represents a proper estimation between the scale markings."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_482.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "2 the diagram shows how the speed of a falling object changes with time.\nspeed\nxx si z\n0\n0 time\nwhich row describes the motion of the object between x and y, and between y and z?\n| | between x and y between y and z\na accelerating at rest\nb accelerating constant speed\ncc decelerating at rest\nd decelerating constant speed", "Chapter": 1, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation for the correct answer: B\n\nThe provided graph is a speed-time graph. The gradient (or slope) of the line on such a graph represents the object's acceleration.\n\n1.  **Motion between X and Y:** In the section of the graph between points X and Y, the line is sloping upwards. This indicates a positive gradient, meaning that the speed of the object is increasing over time. An increase in speed is known as acceleration. Although the curve is becoming less steep (meaning the rate of acceleration is decreasing), the speed is still increasing, so the object is accelerating.\n\n2.  **Motion between Y and Z:** In the section between points Y and Z, the graph is a horizontal line. A horizontal line has a gradient of zero. On a speed-time graph, a zero gradient signifies zero acceleration. This means the object's speed is no longer changing; it is moving at a constant speed. This state is often referred to as terminal velocity for a falling object.\n\nTherefore, the object is accelerating between X and Y and moving at a constant speed between Y and Z.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the incorrect options:\n\n**A) accelerating / at rest**\nThis option is incorrect because the description of the motion between Y and Z is wrong. While the object is indeed moving at a constant speed (zero acceleration), it is not \"at rest\". To be at rest, the speed would have to be zero. The horizontal line is clearly at a positive, non-zero value on the speed axis.\n\n**C) decelerating / at rest**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, between X and Y, the object is accelerating (speed is increasing), not decelerating (speed is decreasing). A downward slope would represent deceleration. Secondly, as explained for option A, the object is not at rest between Y and Z because its speed is constant and greater than zero.\n\n**D) decelerating / constant speed**\nThis option is incorrect because the description of the motion between X and Y is wrong. The term \"decelerating\" means the object's speed is decreasing. On the graph, the line between X and Y is sloping upwards, indicating that the speed is increasing.

The area under section X of the graph is greater than the area under section Y.**\n\nThis statement is correct. In physics, for any speed-time graph, the distance travelled during a specific time interval is equal to the area under the graph for that interval. The area is calculated by considering the shape formed by the graph line, the time axis, and the vertical lines corresponding to the start and end times of the interval. To compare the distances travelled in section X and section Y, one must compare the respective areas under the graph. The statement that the area under section X is greater than the area under section Y is the correct graphical method for demonstrating that more distance was covered in section X.\n\n**B. The gradient of section X of the graph is greater than the gradient of section Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it confuses the concepts of distance and acceleration. The gradient (or slope) of a speed-time graph represents the acceleration of the object. Section X has a positive gradient, indicating positive acceleration (speeding up). Section Y has a negative gradient, indicating negative acceleration (slowing down). While the gradient of X (a positive value) is mathematically greater than the gradient of Y (a negative value), this comparison relates to the rates of change of speed, not the distances travelled.\n\n**C. The speed at the end of section X of the journey is greater than the speed at the end of section Y.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it only considers the speed at single moments in time, not the overall journey during each section. The distance travelled depends on both the speed and the duration of travel. While the speed at the end of section X (the peak speed) is indeed higher than the speed at the end of section Y, this fact alone does not determine which section covered a greater distance. A greater distance is a result of the average speed over the entire time interval, multiplied by the time interval itself, which is what the area under the graph represents.\n\n**D. The time for section X of the journey is greater than the time for section Y.**\n\nThis statement is an incomplete explanation and therefore incorrect. The distance travelled is a function of both average speed and time duration (Distance = Average Speed \u00d7 Time). While the graph shows that the time interval for section X is longer than for section Y, this is only one of the two factors that determine distance. It is possible to travel for a long time at a low average speed and cover less distance than travelling for a short time at a high average speed.

An object will have the same mass on Earth, on the Moon, or in deep space because the quantity of matter it is made of does not change.\n\n*   **Weight of an object can vary from place to place:** Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object's mass. It is calculated as the product of mass and the local gravitational field strength (W = m \u00d7 g). Since the gravitational field strength (g) is not uniform throughout the universe (for example, g is approximately 9.8 N/kg on Earth but only about 1.6 N/kg on the Moon), the weight of an object will change depending on its location.\n\n---\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n**Option A is incorrect.**\n*   Mass is measured using a balance (e.g., a top-pan balance), which compares the object's mass to known masses.

This instrument gives a direct reading of the object's mass in grams or kilograms.\n\n2.  **Measuring Volume:** Because the stone is irregularly shaped, its volume cannot be calculated by measuring its linear dimensions (length, width, height) with a ruler.

Thus, density cannot be calculated with these tools.\n\n**B: measuring cylinder, ruler and water**\nThis option includes the correct equipment for measuring the volume of an irregular object (a measuring cylinder and water). However, it omits any instrument for measuring the stone's mass. Without a measurement of mass, the density cannot be calculated.

This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the direction of each force. The weight acts downwards, while both the ground and the swing provide upward support.

This energy exists as a combination of kinetic energy (due to the orbital motion of the water particles) and potential energy (due to the displacement of water from its equilibrium level). This stored energy can be harnessed by wave power devices.\n\n2.  **Energy stored in tides:** The rise and fall of tides are caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun. This results in the movement of vast quantities of water. The energy is stored in two forms: kinetic energy in the flowing tidal currents and gravitational potential energy due to the difference in height between high tide and low tide.\n\n3.  **Energy stored in water behind dams:** This is a clear example of storing gravitational potential energy (GPE). By holding water at a significant height in a reservoir, a large amount of GPE is stored.

Power is the rate of energy transfer.**\n\nThis statement is the correct definition of power. In physics, power measures how quickly work is done or how quickly energy is transferred from one form to another. The word \"rate\" implies a quantity per unit of time. Therefore, power is calculated by dividing the amount of energy transferred (or work done) by the time it takes for the transfer to occur.

The equation presented in this option (Power = energy \u00d7 time) would imply that for a given amount of energy, the longer the time taken, the greater the power, which is the opposite of the true definition. The correct formula for calculating energy, when power and time are known, is Energy = Power \u00d7 time.\n\n**D.

For example, an older incandescent light bulb might have a high power rating (e.g., 100 W) but be very inefficient, converting most of its electrical energy into heat rather than useful light. In contrast, a modern LED bulb has a much lower power rating (e.g., 10 W) but is far more efficient at converting electricity into light. Thus, a higher power rating does not guarantee higher efficiency."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_491.jpg", "Answer": "B", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_12.pdf", "questionText": "11 in which position does a person exert least pressure on the ground?\na_ kneeling on the ground\nb lying flat on the ground\nc _ sitting on the ground\nd standing on the ground", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "The correct answer is **B**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nPressure is defined as the force applied perpendicular to a surface per unit area over which that force is distributed (Pressure = Force / Area).\n\nIn this scenario, the force being exerted on the ground is the person's weight. The weight of the person remains constant regardless of their position (kneeling, lying, sitting, or standing).\n\nTherefore, the pressure exerted on the ground is inversely proportional to the area of contact between the person and the ground. To exert the least pressure, the person must maximise their area of contact with the ground.\n\n*   **B. lying flat on the ground:** When a person is lying flat, their entire weight is distributed over the largest possible surface area (the area of their back or front).

This change of state occurs at a constant temperature, known as the condensation point (which is numerically equal to the boiling point). For steam to become liquid water, its particles must lose energy, specifically the latent heat of vaporization. This loss of energy allows the fast-moving, widely-spaced particles in the gas to slow down and come closer together, forming the bonds characteristic of a liquid. The question describes steam (gas) at 100 \u00b0C turning into water (liquid) at the same temperature, which is the precise definition of condensation.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A. boiling:**\nBoiling is the change of state from a liquid to a gas.

Boiling occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point (100 \u00b0C for water), and the phase change happens throughout the bulk of the liquid, not just at the surface.\n\n**C. evaporation:**\nEvaporation is also a change of state from a liquid to a gas.

This means the volume of the air decreases.\n\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, pressure is caused by the collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container. Since the mass of the air is fixed, the number of air particles inside the cylinder remains constant. As the volume decreases, these particles are confined to a smaller space, increasing their concentration. This leads to more frequent collisions with the walls of the cylinder and the piston face. The increased rate of collisions results in a greater average force exerted per unit area, which means the pressure increases.\n\nThis relationship is described by Boyle's Law, which states that for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume (P \u221d 1/V). Therefore, as the volume decreases, the pressure must increase.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**A: decreases, decreases**\nThis option correctly states that the volume decreases but incorrectly states that the pressure also decreases. Compressing a gas into a smaller volume forces the particles closer together, leading to more frequent collisions with the container walls and thus an increase, not a decrease, in pressure.\n\n**B: decreases, does not change**\nThis option is incorrect because pushing the piston in explicitly reduces the space occupied by the gas, meaning the volume must decrease. Furthermore, a change in volume of a fixed mass of gas will result in a change in pressure (unless the temperature is changed in a very specific way, which is not the case here). Compressing the gas increases its pressure.\n\n**D: increases, increases**\nThis option is incorrect because pushing the piston *in* reduces the volume, it does not increase it.

This means they become shorter in colder conditions. The cables are installed with a noticeable sag on a warm day because they are in a relatively expanded state. As the weather turns colder, for instance during the night or in winter, the cables will cool down and contract. If they were installed taut (tightly stretched) on a warm day, this subsequent contraction would create immense tension along the cables. This high level of stress could be sufficient to snap the cables or damage the supporting pylons. Therefore, leaving slack in the cables is a crucial design consideration to accommodate thermal contraction and prevent mechanical failure.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B. They will contract on very warm days.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The principle of thermal expansion dictates that materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. On a very warm day, the temperature of the cables would increase, causing them to expand and become longer, not contract. Contraction occurs in response to a decrease in temperature.\n\n**C. They will expand on cold days.**\nThis statement contradicts the known behaviour of materials with temperature changes. Materials contract (become shorter) on cold days as their temperature decreases. They expand (become longer) when heated. Therefore, electricity cables will not expand on cold days.\n\n**D. They will expand on very warm days.**\nWhile it is true that electricity cables will expand and sag more on very warm days, this is not the reason they are installed with slack. The primary engineering concern is preventing failure under high tension. Expansion on a warmer day would cause the cables to sag further, reducing tension, which is not a risk to the structural integrity of the system. The critical risk that must be managed is the high tension caused by contraction on cold days.

Within the liquid, particles are in constant, random motion and possess a range of kinetic energies. Only the particles with the highest kinetic energy, located at the surface, have sufficient energy to overcome the attractive intermolecular forces holding them in the liquid. These high-energy particles escape from the liquid into the surrounding air.\n\nSince the most energetic particles leave, the average kinetic energy of the remaining particles in the liquid decreases. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. Therefore, a decrease in the average kinetic energy results in a decrease in the temperature of the liquid. This phenomenon is known as evaporative cooling. This diagram correctly illustrates both the escape of particles and the resultant cooling of the liquid.\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Answers:\n\n**B**\nThis diagram incorrectly describes evaporation. The process of particles entering a liquid from a gaseous state is called condensation. During condensation, gas particles lose kinetic energy and form bonds with the liquid particles, releasing energy in the form of latent heat. This release of energy increases the average kinetic energy of the particles in the liquid, causing the liquid to heat up. Therefore, this diagram depicts condensation, which is the reverse process of evaporation.\n\n**C**\nThis diagram correctly shows that particles escape from the liquid, which is characteristic of evaporation. However, it incorrectly states that the liquid heats up. During evaporation, the most energetic particles are the ones that escape. This removal of high-energy particles lowers the average kinetic energy of the particles remaining in the liquid. As temperature is a measure of this average kinetic energy, the liquid's temperature decreases. Therefore, evaporation is a cooling process, not a heating one.\n\n**D**\nThis diagram is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, it shows particles entering the liquid, which is condensation, not evaporation. Evaporation involves particles escaping from the liquid's surface. Secondly, it incorrectly pairs the process of condensation with cooling. When particles condense from a gas to a liquid, they release latent heat, which warms the liquid.

This phenomenon occurs because the refractive index of glass is dependent on the wavelength of the light.\n\n1.  **Refraction and Wavelength:** Light with a longer wavelength is refracted (bent) less than light with a shorter wavelength. In the visible spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength, and violet light has the shortest.\n2.  **Identifying P and Q:** In the diagram, the ray labelled P is shown to be deviated the least from its original path.

This process involves two key properties of the radiation: its wavelength and its speed.\n\n1.  **Wavelength:** The electromagnetic spectrum is an ordered arrangement of radiation types by wavelength and frequency. Gamma rays have extremely short wavelengths, high frequencies, and high energies. Microwaves, on the other hand, have much longer wavelengths, lower frequencies, and lower energies. For the radiation to shift from the gamma ray region to the microwave region, its wavelength must have significantly **increased**. This is a direct consequence of the expansion of the universe, which has stretched the waves as they travel through space over billions of years.\n\n2.  **Speed:** A fundamental principle of physics is that all forms of electromagnetic radiation travel at the same constant speed in a vacuum, known as the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10\u2078 m/s).

A balance measures the downward force exerted on it. An increase in the reading indicates that there is an additional downward force acting on the magnet that is on the balance. This additional downward force is the result of a magnetic repulsive force between the bar PQ and the permanent magnet.\n\nMagnetic repulsion occurs only between two like poles (e.g., North-North or South-South). Since the top of the magnet on the balance is a South pole, the end of the bar PQ closest to it (end Q) must also be a South pole to cause repulsion. For bar PQ to have a permanent South pole, it must be a permanent magnet. An unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, such as an iron bar, would always be attracted to a magnet, which would cause a decrease in the balance reading. Therefore, bar PQ must be a permanent magnet only.\n\n---\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: an iron bar or a permanent magnet with P a N pole**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it includes the possibility of bar PQ being an iron bar. An iron bar is a ferromagnetic material and would be attracted to the South pole of the permanent magnet on the balance through magnetic induction. This attractive force would exert an upward pull on the magnet, causing the reading on the balance to decrease, which contradicts the observation. While a permanent magnet with pole P as North (and therefore Q as South) would cause repulsion, the inclusion of the incorrect \"iron bar\" possibility makes the entire option invalid.\n\n**B: an iron bar or a permanent magnet with Q a N pole**\n\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained for option A, an iron bar would be attracted to the magnet, causing the balance reading to decrease. Secondly, if bar PQ were a permanent magnet with end Q being a North pole, it would be attracted to the South pole of the magnet on the balance (since opposite poles attract). This attractive force would also cause the balance reading to decrease. As the observation shows an increase in reading, both possibilities in this option are incorrect.\n\n**C: an iron bar only**\n\nThis option is incorrect because an iron bar, being a ferromagnetic material, would become temporarily magnetised by induction when brought near the permanent magnet. This process always results in an attractive force, regardless of which pole of the permanent magnet is used. The attractive force would pull the magnet on the balance upwards, reducing the net downward force and thus decreasing the balance reading.

If one incorrectly uses the value of 5.0 for the current in the Ohm's Law equation (R = 100 V / 5.0), the result is 20.

The resistance (R) can then be calculated using Ohm's Law, R = V/I, where V is the potential difference and I is the current.\n\nThe correct setup requires specific placement of the measuring instruments:\n1.  An **ammeter**, which measures current, must be connected in **series** with the component. This ensures that the same current being measured flows through the component.\n2.  A **voltmeter**, which measures potential difference, must be connected in **parallel** with the component.

With these correct measurements of V and I for the thermistor, its resistance can be determined.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Options\n\n*   **Option A is incorrect** because the ammeter is connected in parallel with the thermistor. An ammeter has very low resistance and, when connected in parallel, it creates a short circuit, diverting most of the current away from the thermistor. This leads to an incorrect current measurement for the thermistor. Furthermore, the voltmeter is connected in parallel with both the thermistor and the variable resistor, so it measures their combined potential difference, not the potential difference across the thermistor alone.\n\n*   **Option B is incorrect** because the ammeter is connected in parallel with the variable resistor, not the thermistor. This is an improper connection for an ammeter. The voltmeter is also connected incorrectly, as it is not placed directly across the thermistor.

Its correct placement and rating are essential for protecting both the appliance and the user.\n\n1.  **Position of the Fuse:** For safety, a fuse must always be connected in series with the **live wire**. The live wire is at a high electrical potential relative to the earth. If a fault occurs causing a surge in current, the fuse in the live wire will melt and break the circuit. This action completely disconnects the appliance from the high-potential supply, making it safe to touch.\n\n2.  **Fuse Rating:** The rating of a fuse should be slightly higher than the normal operating current of the appliance. This allows the appliance to draw its required current during normal operation without blowing the fuse.

Standard fuse ratings are available in specific values (e.g., 3 A, 5 A, 13 A).

The count rate is high when the detector is close to the source but drops sharply to zero at a distance of 4 cm. This is a characteristic property of alpha (\u03b1) particles. Alpha particles are relatively large and highly ionising, meaning they interact frequently with air molecules, rapidly lose their energy, and are stopped after travelling only a few centimetres. The data, showing the radiation is completely absorbed by 4 cm of air, is consistent with the known range of alpha particles.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n*   **B: \u03b2-particles**\n    Beta (\u03b2) particles are much smaller and less ionising than alpha particles. Consequently, they have a longer range in air, typically up to a few metres. If the source were emitting beta particles, a measurable count rate would still be detected at distances of 4 cm and 6 cm, although it would decrease with distance. The complete absorption of the radiation at such a short distance rules out beta particles.\n\n*   **C: \u03b3-rays**\n    Gamma (\u03b3) rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. They are weakly ionising and highly penetrating, allowing them to travel very long distances in air (many metres). Their intensity decreases with distance, but they would not be completely stopped by just a few centimetres of air. Therefore, if the radiation were gamma rays, a significant count rate would be measured at all the distances tested.\n\n*   **D: X-rays**\n    Like gamma rays, X-rays are a form of highly penetrating electromagnetic radiation.

Gamma (\u03b3) radiation is a high-energy electromagnetic wave (a photon) released from an excited nucleus as it transitions to a more stable, lower-energy state.

For the rate of emission to drop to one-quarter of its initial value, two half-lives must pass. This answer might result from mistakenly dividing the half-life by four (120 minutes / 4 = 30 minutes) because the final rate is one-quarter of the initial rate. However, the relationship between time and radioactive decay is exponential, not a simple proportional division.\n\n#### B: 45 minutes\nThis option is incorrect. A time of 45 minutes is substantially less than one half-life (120 minutes). After one full half-life, the rate of emission would only have decreased to 50 particles per second. To reach 25 particles per second, a second half-life must occur, requiring a total time significantly longer than 120 minutes.\n\n#### C: 90 minutes\nThis option is incorrect. This value may arise from the misconception that radioactive decay is a linear process. One might incorrectly reason that since the activity has been reduced by 75% (from 100 to 25), the time elapsed should be 75% of one half-life (0.75 \u00d7 120 minutes = 90 minutes).

The Sun, being a star, emits energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This includes not only visible light but also other forms of radiation such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation has shorter wavelengths than visible light and carries more energy. It is this component of sunlight that is responsible for causing sunburn.\n\n### Explanation for option C (Incorrect)\nThis statement is correct. A significant portion of the energy radiated by the Sun is in the form of infrared (IR) radiation. Infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than visible light and is primarily perceived as heat.

The correct relationship between speed, distance, and time is that speed is the distance travelled per unit of time. The formula is `speed = distance travelled / time taken`.

This constant acceleration is known as the acceleration due to gravity, denoted by the symbol *g* (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface).\n\nNewton's Second Law of Motion states that the net force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma).

The formula for weight is **W = m \u00d7 g**, where 'W' is weight, 'm' is mass, and 'g' is the gravitational field strength (or acceleration of free fall).

Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object and is a scalar quantity measured in kilograms (kg).

These elements are minerals that are mined from the Earth's crust. The total amount of these materials available on Earth is finite. In a nuclear power station, the fuel is consumed through the process of nuclear fission to release energy. Since these mineral reserves are depleted with use and are not replenished on a human timescale, nuclear fuel is a non-renewable resource.\n\n### **Incorrect Answer Analysis**\n\n**A: biofuel**\nBiofuel is a renewable energy resource. It is produced from biomass, which is organic matter from recently living sources, such as plants (e.g., corn, sugarcane) or algae. Because these plants can be grown and harvested in a continuous cycle, the source of the fuel can be replenished relatively quickly. This makes biofuel a renewable alternative to fossil fuels.\n\n**B: energy from the Sun**\nEnergy from the Sun (solar energy) is a primary example of a renewable energy resource. The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion and is expected to radiate energy for billions of years. For all practical human purposes, the Sun's energy is inexhaustible and is constantly available, making it a reliable and renewable source.\n\n**D: water behind a dam**\nThe energy associated with water behind a dam is a form of renewable energy known as hydroelectric power. The water stored in the reservoir possesses gravitational potential energy.

The force exerted by the gas on the piston will increase because the particles are hitting the piston more frequently.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The force exerted by a gas is a result of the pressure it creates, and pressure arises from the collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container. Let's break down the process:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Force, Pressure, and Volume:** The pressure of a gas is defined as the force exerted per unit area (P = F/A). For the piston, the force (F) is the pressure (P) multiplied by the area of the piston (A). Since the piston's area is constant, the force on the piston is directly proportional to the gas pressure. According to Boyle's Law, for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, pressure is inversely proportional to volume (P \u221d 1/V). Therefore, as the volume is reduced, the pressure increases, and consequently, the force on the piston increases.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Theory Explanation:** From the perspective of the kinetic theory of gases:\n    *   The problem states that the volume is reduced. Since the number of gas particles is fixed, reducing the volume increases the particle density (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   With the particles confined to a smaller space, they will travel shorter distances before striking the walls of the container, including the piston. This leads to an increase in the number of collisions with the piston per unit of time, i.e., the collision frequency increases.\n    *   The temperature is constant, which means the average kinetic energy of the gas particles is also constant. Therefore, the particles do not move faster or hit the piston with greater force on average during each individual collision.\n    *   The increase in the total force on the piston is due to the increased *frequency* of these collisions, not an increase in the force of each collision.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n**A. The force exerted by the gas on the piston will decrease because the particles move more quickly.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, reducing the volume of a gas at constant temperature increases its pressure, which in turn increases the force on the piston, not decreases it. Secondly, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. Since the temperature is held constant, the average speed of the particles does not change; they do not move more quickly.\n\n**B. The force exerted by the gas on the piston will decrease because the particles move more slowly.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, as explained by Boyle's Law, reducing the volume increases the pressure and thus the force, it does not decrease it. Secondly, the condition of constant temperature means the average speed of the gas particles remains constant; they do not move more slowly.\n\n**C. The force exerted by the gas on the piston will increase because the particles are hitting the piston harder.**\n\nWhile it is true that the force exerted by the gas on the piston will increase, the reason given is incorrect. \"Hitting the piston harder\" implies that the force of each individual collision has increased. This would require the particles to have a higher average kinetic energy and therefore a higher speed. However, the problem specifies that the temperature is constant, meaning the average kinetic energy and speed of the particles do not change. The increase in total force is due to the higher *frequency* of collisions, not the greater force of individual collisions."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_533.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "13 the air temperature rises from 10\u00b0c to 40\u00b0c.\nwhat is the change in temperature, expressed in kelvin?\na 30k b 50k c 243k d 303k", "Chapter": 2, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe question asks for the *change* in temperature (\u0394T), not the final temperature. The Celsius (\u00b0C) and Kelvin (K) scales have different zero points, but the size of one degree Celsius is identical to the size of one kelvin.\n\n1.  First, calculate the change in temperature on the Celsius scale:\n    \u0394T (\u00b0C) = Final Temperature - Initial Temperature\n    \u0394T (\u00b0C) = 40 \u00b0C - 10 \u00b0C = 30 \u00b0C\n\n2.  Because a change of 1 \u00b0C is equivalent to a change of 1 K, a temperature change of 30 \u00b0C is equivalent to a temperature change of 30 K.\n\nTherefore, the change in temperature is 30 K.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B: 50 K**\nThis value is obtained by adding the initial and final temperatures (10 \u00b0C + 40 \u00b0C = 50 \u00b0C). The term \"change in temperature\" implies finding the difference between the final and initial values, which requires subtraction, not addition.\n\n**C: 243 K**\nThis value may result from incorrectly applying the temperature conversion formula. For instance, calculating the temperature change in Celsius (30 \u00b0C) and then subtracting this from the Kelvin conversion factor (273 - 30 = 243). The conversion formula (K = \u00b0C + 273) is used to convert a specific temperature point, not a temperature interval or change.\n\n**D: 303 K**\nThis is a common error. It arises from first correctly calculating the temperature change in Celsius (40 \u00b0C - 10 \u00b0C = 30 \u00b0C) and then incorrectly attempting to convert this *change* to Kelvin by adding 273 (30 + 273 = 303 K).

According to the principles of fluid dynamics, the pressure within a liquid increases with depth (hydrostatic pressure). As a bubble of gas (e.g., carbon dioxide) rises from the bottom of the drink to the surface, the depth of the liquid above it decreases. This results in a reduction of the external pressure exerted on the bubble. According to Boyle's Law, for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure. Therefore, as the pressure decreases, the volume of the gas bubble increases, causing it to expand. Any temperature change as the bubble rises is typically negligible and not the main cause of the expansion.\n\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A) convection currents in air**\nThis is incorrect because convection currents are a direct result of thermal expansion. When a region of air is heated, its particles gain kinetic energy and move further apart, causing the volume of the air to increase (thermal expansion). This expansion leads to a decrease in density. The less dense, warmer air rises, and cooler, denser air sinks to take its place. This continuous circulation of air due to density differences caused by thermal expansion is known as a convection current.\n\n**C) expansion of a liquid in a thermometer**\nThis is incorrect because the operation of a liquid-in-glass thermometer is fundamentally based on the principle of thermal expansion. When the thermometer bulb is exposed to a higher temperature, the liquid inside (such as mercury or alcohol) absorbs thermal energy. This causes the liquid particles to move more vigorously and increase their average separation, resulting in an overall increase in the liquid's volume. This expansion forces the liquid to rise up the narrow capillary tube, providing a visual indication of the temperature.\n\n**D) lengthening of overhead power lines in the summer**\nThis is incorrect because the lengthening of power lines is a classic example of linear thermal expansion in solids. During the summer, ambient temperatures are higher. The metal cables absorb thermal energy from the environment, which increases the kinetic energy of the atoms within the metal. This increased atomic vibration causes the average distance between the atoms to increase, leading to an expansion of the material in all dimensions.

The least energetic water particles escape from the surface and do not return.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the least energetic particles do not possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction.

Of these, only radiation can travel through a vacuum. Radiation is the transfer of heat in the form of electromagnetic waves, primarily infrared radiation. These waves do not require a medium (particles) for their propagation.

Both conduction and convection require a medium to transfer thermal energy. Conduction relies on the transfer of kinetic energy between adjacent particles, while convection involves the movement of a heated fluid. A vacuum is a space devoid of matter, meaning there are no particles to conduct heat or form convection currents.

Conduction is the process of heat transfer through direct contact, where vibrating particles pass on their kinetic energy to neighbouring particles. This mechanism is only possible in a substance that contains particles (a solid, liquid, or gas). Since a vacuum is an empty space with virtually no particles, conduction cannot take place.\n\n**C. convection only**\n\nThis option is incorrect. Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid (a liquid or a gas).

When white light enters a denser medium like a prism, it undergoes refraction. Because the refractive index of the prism's material varies slightly with the wavelength of light, each color component of the white light is refracted by a different amount. This phenomenon is called dispersion.\n\nViolet light has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum and experiences the highest refractive index, causing it to bend the most. Red light has the longest wavelength and experiences the lowest refractive index, so it bends the least. Consequently, as the light exits the prism, the colors are separated into a spectrum, with red light being deviated the least (appearing at the top) and violet light being deviated the most (appearing at the bottom). This diagram accurately depicts both the correct direction of refraction at both surfaces and the correct order of the dispersed colors.\n\n### Explanations for the Incorrect Answers\n\n#### Explanation for A\nThis diagram is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the direction of refraction at the second surface (exit) is wrong. When light travels from a denser medium (prism) to a less dense medium (air), it should bend away from the normal. For this prism orientation, this means the light should bend further downwards, not upwards as shown. Secondly, the order of the colors is reversed. Violet light bends more than red light, so it should be at the bottom of the spectrum, not the top.\n\n#### Explanation for B\nThis diagram shows the correct order of the dispersed colors, with red light deviated least and violet light deviated most. However, the path of the light rays is incorrect. While the initial refraction upon entering the prism is shown correctly, the refraction upon exiting is not. As light leaves the prism and enters the air, it should bend away from the normal, which would cause a further downward deviation. The diagram incorrectly shows the light bending upwards upon exit.\n\n#### Explanation for C\nThis diagram correctly shows the direction of refraction at both surfaces of the prism\u2014the light bends downwards upon entering and further downwards upon exiting. However, the order of the emergent colors is incorrect. It shows red light being deviated more than violet light.

A metal sphere contains a vast number of mobile charge carriers, specifically free-moving electrons, and fixed positive ions. Initially, the sphere is uncharged, meaning it has an equal amount of positive and negative charge, which are distributed uniformly.\n\nWhen the negatively charged rod is brought near the sphere, it exerts an electrostatic force on the charges within the metal. According to the fundamental law of electrostatics, like charges repel and opposite charges attract. The excess electrons on the negatively charged rod will repel the free-moving electrons in the metal sphere.\n\nConsequently, these free electrons migrate to the side of the sphere that is farthest from the rod, which is side Q. This accumulation of electrons on side Q results in it having a net negative charge.\n\nSimultaneously, the region of the sphere closest to the rod, side P, experiences a deficit of electrons as they have moved away. This leaves behind the fixed positive ions, resulting in a net positive charge on side P. Therefore, side P becomes positively charged, and side Q becomes negatively charged.\n\n***\n\n**Incorrect Answer Explanations:**\n\n**A: P and Q are both negatively charged.**\nThis is incorrect. The metal sphere is described as isolated and initially uncharged. For the entire sphere to become negatively charged, it would have to gain electrons from an external source. Since the rod does not touch the sphere and the sphere is isolated, no charge is transferred. Electrostatic induction causes a separation of charge, not the creation of a net charge of one type across the whole object.\n\n**B: P and Q are both positively charged.**\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option A. For the sphere to become positively charged, it would need to lose electrons. As the sphere is isolated, there is no pathway for electrons to leave. The principle of conservation of charge dictates that the total charge of the isolated sphere must remain zero. Induction merely redistributes the existing charges.\n\n**C: P is negatively charged and Q is positively charged.**\nThis is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what occurs. A negatively charged rod repels like charges (electrons) and attracts opposite charges (the fixed positive ions). Therefore, the free electrons will be pushed away from the rod, not drawn towards it.

Note that based on the principles of physics, option D is the correct answer. The explanations are written accordingly.\n\n### Correct Answer: D\n\nAccording to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (e.m.f.), or voltage, in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage. A stronger bar magnet produces a more intense magnetic field, meaning it has a greater magnetic flux. When this stronger magnet is moved towards the coil at the same speed, it causes a larger change in magnetic flux through the coil per unit of time. This greater rate of change of magnetic flux induces a larger e.m.f., which is observed as a greater reading on the voltmeter.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A: Hold the bar magnet stationary inside the coil.**\nElectromagnetic induction requires a *change* in the magnetic flux passing through the coil. If the magnet is held stationary, the magnetic field and the magnetic flux through the coil remain constant. Since the rate of change of magnetic flux is zero, no e.m.f. is induced. The voltmeter would show a reading of zero, not a greater reading.\n\n**B: Move the bar magnet slowly away from the coil.**\nThe magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is proportional to the speed of the relative motion between the magnet and the coil. Moving the magnet more slowly decreases the rate at which the magnetic flux lines are \"cut\" by the coil. This smaller rate of change of magnetic flux results in a *smaller* induced e.m.f., not a greater one. The original experiment involved moving the magnet quickly, which would induce a larger e.m.f. than moving it slowly.\n\n**C: Use a coil of wire with fewer turns on it.**\nThe total induced e.m.f. in a coil is proportional to the number of turns of wire. Each turn of the coil contributes to the total voltage induced. Using a coil with fewer turns means there is less wire interacting with the changing magnetic field. This reduces the total magnetic flux linkage and, consequently, results in a *smaller* induced e.m.f. for the same motion of the magnet."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_551.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "32 the direction of the current in a straight wire x is into the paper.\nwhich diagram shows the shape of the magnetic field pattern around the wire?\na b cc d", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "Based on the principles of electromagnetism, the correct answer is A. Below are the explanations for why option A is correct and why the other options are incorrect.\n\n### Explanation for Option A\n\nThis diagram correctly shows the shape of the magnetic field around a long, straight, current-carrying wire. According to the principles of electromagnetism, a steady electric current produces a magnetic field. For a straight conductor, the magnetic field lines are a series of concentric circles in a plane perpendicular to the wire, with the wire at the center. The diagram accurately depicts these concentric circles. Furthermore, the spacing of the circles increases with distance from the wire, correctly indicating that the magnetic field becomes weaker further away from the conductor.\n\n### Explanation for Option B\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows a uniform magnetic field, represented by parallel and equally spaced straight lines. A uniform magnetic field has the same strength and direction at every point. The magnetic field around a single straight wire is non-uniform; its strength decreases with increasing distance from the wire. A uniform magnetic field is typically found in the central region of a long solenoid or between the wide, flat poles of a large magnet.\n\n### Explanation for Option C\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it illustrates a dipole magnetic field. This pattern, with field lines looping from one side to the other, is characteristic of the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet (with a north and south pole) or by a small, circular loop of current. It does not represent the magnetic field around a long, straight wire.\n\n### Explanation for Option D\n\nThis diagram is incorrect because it shows magnetic field lines radiating outwards from the wire. A fundamental property of magnetism is that magnetic field lines always form closed loops; they do not have starting or ending points. A pattern of radiating lines would imply the existence of a magnetic monopole (an isolated north or south pole), which has never been observed in nature. This type of radial pattern is characteristic of the electric field around a point charge, not the magnetic field around a current."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_552.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "33 what does a step-up transformer increase?\na current\nb_ energy\nc power\nd_ voltage", "Chapter": 4, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: D\n\nA step-up transformer is a device designed specifically to increase the voltage of an alternating current (AC). It operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction. A step-up transformer has more turns of wire in its secondary coil than in its primary coil. The ratio of the output (secondary) voltage to the input (primary) voltage is equal to the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil to the number of turns in the primary coil. Because the secondary coil has more turns, the induced voltage in the secondary coil is greater than the voltage in the primary coil.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations\n\n**A. current**\nIn a transformer, electrical power is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. For an ideal transformer with 100% efficiency, the power input equals the power output (Power = Voltage \u00d7 Current). According to the principle of conservation of energy, if the voltage is increased (stepped up), the current must be decreased proportionally to keep the power constant. Therefore, a step-up transformer decreases the current, it does not increase it.\n\n**B. energy**\nTransformers are subject to the law of conservation of energy. They are passive devices that transfer energy from one circuit to another; they cannot create or generate energy. In fact, real transformers are not perfectly efficient and lose some energy as heat due to the resistance of the coils and other factors. Consequently, the energy output from a transformer is always less than (or, in an ideal case, equal to) the energy input. A transformer cannot increase energy.\n\n**C. power**\nPower is the rate at which energy is transferred. In an ideal transformer, where no energy is lost, the power input to the primary coil is equal to the power output from the secondary coil. In any real transformer, some energy is converted into heat, meaning the output power is slightly less than the input power. Therefore, a transformer does not increase power; at best, it can only transfer it with minimal loss."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_553.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "34 when measuring the emissions from a radioactive rock brought into the laboratory, a teacher\nmentions that background radiation must be taken into account.\nwhat is this background radiation?\na __ ionising radiation in the laboratory when the radioactive rock is not present\nb _ ionising radiation from the radioactive rock brought into the laboratory\nc infrared radiation from the sun\nd infrared radiation from warm objects in the laboratory", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n**A. ionising radiation in the laboratory when the radioactive rock is not present**\n\nThis statement correctly defines background radiation in the context of this experiment. Background radiation is the low-level, ubiquitous ionising radiation present in the environment. It originates from a variety of natural and artificial sources, including:\n*   **Cosmic rays:** High-energy particles from outer space that continuously bombard the Earth.\n*   **Terrestrial sources:** Naturally occurring radioactive materials in the ground, rocks, and building materials (e.g., granite).\n*   **Radon gas:** A radioactive gas released from the decay of uranium in the ground, which can accumulate indoors.\n*   **Internal sources:** Trace amounts of radioactive isotopes within all living things, including the human body (e.g., carbon-14 and potassium-40).\n\nWhen measuring the radiation from a specific source, like the radioactive rock, a detector will simultaneously pick up this background radiation. To find the true radiation level of the rock alone, one must first measure the background count rate (with the rock absent) and then subtract this value from the total count rate measured with the rock present.\n\n### Explanations of the Incorrect Answers\n\n**B. ionising radiation from the radioactive rock brought into the laboratory**\n\nThis is incorrect because the ionising radiation from the radioactive rock is the specific radiation that the experiment aims to measure. It is the \"signal\" or the \"source radiation,\" not the \"background.\" The background radiation is the radiation from all other sources that interferes with the measurement of the rock's emissions.\n\n**C. infrared radiation from the Sun**\n\nThis is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, the experiment is measuring *ionising radiation* (such as alpha, beta, or gamma radiation) which is emitted by radioactive materials. Infrared radiation is a type of *non-ionising* electromagnetic radiation, primarily associated with heat. Detectors used for radioactive emissions are not designed to measure infrared radiation. Secondly, while the Sun is a source of radiation, the term \"background radiation\" in nuclear physics specifically refers to ambient *ionising* radiation.\n\n**D. infrared radiation from warm objects in the laboratory**\n\nThis is incorrect for the same reasons as option C. All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared (thermal) radiation. However, this is non-ionising radiation and would not be detected by the equipment used to measure the emissions from a radioactive source. The background that must be accounted for in this experiment is the unwanted *ionising* radiation from other sources in the lab environment."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_554.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "35 how do the ionising effect and the penetrating ability of a-particles compare with those of\nb-particles and y-rays?\nionising penetrating\neffect ability\na higher lower\nb higher higher\ncc lower lower\nd lower higher", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\nAlpha (\u03b1) particles have a **higher** ionising effect and a **lower** penetrating ability compared to beta (\u03b2) particles and gamma (\u03b3) rays.\n\n*   **Ionising Effect:** An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. Its relatively large mass and +2 charge cause it to interact strongly with the atoms of any material it passes through. Through strong electrostatic forces, it readily pulls electrons away from these atoms, creating a large number of ion pairs over a very short distance. This makes alpha radiation the most highly ionising of the three types.\n\n*   **Penetrating Ability:** Because alpha particles interact so strongly and frequently with matter, they lose their energy very rapidly. This rapid energy transfer means they cannot travel far into a substance. They are easily stopped by a thin sheet of paper or a few centimetres of air. Consequently, they have the lowest penetrating ability.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: B\n\nThis option incorrectly states that alpha particles have a higher penetrating ability. Alpha particles have the *lowest* penetrating ability among alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Their large size and charge cause them to lose energy quickly through collisions and ionisation, preventing them from penetrating far into materials.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: C\n\nThis option incorrectly states that alpha particles have a lower ionising effect. Due to their significant mass and double positive charge, alpha particles are the *most* ionising form of nuclear radiation. They are much more effective at knocking electrons out of atoms than the smaller, singly-charged beta particles or the uncharged gamma rays.\n\n### Incorrect Answer: D\n\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. It claims alpha particles have a lower ionising effect and a higher penetrating ability. This is the opposite of their actual properties. In fact, these properties more closely describe gamma rays, which are weakly ionising and highly penetrating. Alpha particles are strongly ionising and have very low penetrating power."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_555.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "36 half-life is ......1...... for the ......2...... a sample of a radioactive isotope to halve.\nwhich words correctly complete gaps 1 and 2?\nee\n\na half of the time taken nucleon number of\nb half of the time taken number of nuclei in\ncc the time taken nucleon number of\nd the time taken number of nuclei in", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "The correct answer is **D**.\n\n**Explanation for Correct Answer D:**\nThe half-life of a radioactive substance is defined as **the time taken** for the **number of undecayed nuclei** in a sample to be reduced to half of its original value. Option D perfectly aligns with this fundamental definition.\n*   **1: \"the time taken\"** correctly identifies that half-life is a measure of a time interval.\n*   **2: \"number of nuclei in\"** correctly identifies the quantity that halves. Radioactive decay is a process that involves individual atomic nuclei transforming, so it is the count of these radioactive nuclei that decreases over time.\n\nTherefore, the complete and correct statement is: \"Half-life is the time taken for the number of nuclei in a sample of a radioactive isotope to halve.\"\n\n---\n\n### Explanations for Incorrect Options:\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer A:**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, half-life is the specific time interval itself, not \"half of the time taken\" for some process. Secondly, the \"nucleon number\" (or mass number, A) is the total count of protons and neutrons within a single nucleus. This is a characteristic of the isotope and does not halve. The quantity that halves is the number of radioactive nuclei in the entire sample.\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer B:**\nThis option incorrectly defines half-life as \"half of the time taken\". Half-life *is* the time taken for the specified event to occur, not a fraction of it. Although the second part, \"number of nuclei in\", correctly identifies the quantity that halves, the error in the first part makes the entire statement incorrect.\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Answer C:**\nThis option correctly identifies half-life as \"the time taken\" but incorrectly states that the \"nucleon number\" is the quantity that halves. The nucleon number is a property of a single nucleus (e.g., the nucleon number of Carbon-14 is always 14). It is the total count of the Carbon-14 nuclei in the sample that reduces by half in one half-life, not the nucleon number itself."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_556.jpg", "Answer": "D", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "37 radioactive materials must be handled in a safe way.\nwhat is not a safety procedure?\na _ storing radioactive materials in cardboard boxes\nb_ monitoring exposure time to radioactive materials\nc using tongs to pick up the radioactive source\nd_ wearing protective clothing", "Chapter": 5, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "### Correct Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**\nStoring radioactive materials in cardboard boxes is **not** a safety procedure because cardboard offers virtually no shielding against penetrating radiation like beta particles and gamma rays. Safe storage requires placing radioactive sources in containers made of dense materials, such as lead, which can effectively absorb the radiation and reduce the exposure to people nearby. A cardboard box is easily permeable to radiation and does not provide the necessary protection, making this an unsafe practice.\n\n---\n### Incorrect Answer Explanations:\n\n**B. monitoring exposure time to radioactive materials**\nThis is a fundamental safety procedure. The total radiation dose a person receives is directly proportional to the duration of exposure. Therefore, by carefully monitoring and limiting the time spent near a radioactive source, one can effectively minimize their radiation dose and reduce health risks.\n\n**C. using tongs to pick up the radioactive source**\nThis is a critical safety procedure based on the principle of distance. The intensity of radiation decreases rapidly as the distance from the source increases, following the inverse square law. Using long-handled tongs or robotic arms to manipulate a radioactive source increases the distance between the handler and the source, significantly reducing the radiation dose received.\n\n**D. wearing protective clothing**\nThis is a standard safety procedure. Protective clothing serves two main purposes in radiation safety: shielding and preventing contamination. Specialized clothing, such as lead-lined aprons, provides shielding from radiation. General laboratory clothing, such as lab coats, gloves, and overshoes, prevents radioactive material from coming into contact with the skin or personal clothing, thereby preventing contamination."}, {"questionName": "IG_phy_p1_557.jpg", "Answer": "A", "pdfName": "0625_w24_qp_13.pdf", "questionText": "38 the solar system contains eight major planets.\nwhat is the correct order of three of the major planets, starting with the planet furthest from the\nsun?\na mercury > venus > earth\nb_ neptune > jupiter > saturn\nc neptune > mars > earth\nd jupiter > saturn > uranus", "Chapter": 6, "Level": "IGCSE", "paperNumber": 1, "Subject": "physics", "Explanation": "Here are the explanations for the provided question:\n\n### Correct Answer: A\n\nThe order of the eight major planets in our Solar System, starting from the one closest to the Sun and moving outward, is: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
